    "Airbnb is one of many visitors' prefered choices to book stays visiting places from busy cities to national parks. <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "In this Seattle Airbnb data set, data anlyses and visualizations were used to answer the following questions: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike? <br><br>\n",
    "   *This helps Seattle area business owners and Airbnb to get ready for the hot season (**business decision**), as well as helps visitor in planning travel accordingly to avoid peak seasons (**personal choice**).* <br><br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle? <br><br>\n",
    "   *Trends in Airbnb listing and visitor growth from 2009 to 2016 were distilled from listings and reviews datasets.* <br><br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Can you describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?<br><br>\n",
    "   *Sentiment analysis via [textblob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) and [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) was performed to describe the vibe of major Seattle neighborhoods. **This helps the potential visitors to select the neighborhood to stay which match their personal taste**.*<br><br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. How does visitors feel about the listings in each Seattle neighborhood using review comments?<br><br>\n",
    "    *Sentiment analysis was used on visitor review comments to extract what are the pros and cons on listed properties in each neighborhoods. **This helps the rental property owners to identify room for improvement and enhance visitors' staying experience**.*<br><br>\n",

    "To answer the first question, it is most ideal to have the booking information of the listings in Seattle area. However, this information is not provided as a dataset. Instead, reviews dataset can be used to inform this information, due to the fact that, after a stay, visitor tends to leave a review. Each row in the df_reviews can be used as a count. By summing up the counts according to year and month, the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle can be found, i.e., hot season vs cold season. <br><br>\n",

    "For the second question, with the information on the busiest months (hot season) and normal months (cold season), the average prices for each individual listing during hot and cold seasons are calculated using calendar dataset. Price info included in calendar dataset is only for 2016. Therefore the price spike is for the year 2016. To obtain this information, first, the price increase for each listing from cold to hot season is calculated. The final averaged price increase among all listings indicates by how much prices spike from cold to hot season in Seattle area Airbnb rental properties."

There is a really nice energy in the house as well! The neighborhood is great and very easy to get around. I definitely recommend it.  It was simple to get in and settle down in this cute townhouse. Dina was communicative and accommodating! Dina was great. After a last minute cancelation of another airbnb, she was able to accommodate us in her home on short notice. The place is great, along with the location. Coffee shops, the locks, restaurants all within walking distance. She was also very easy to talk to and quick to respond to my questions. Dina was a wonderful host. We were in Seattle for a golf trip and she gave us excellent recommendations for golf, places to eat in Ballard, etc. The location is fantastic near the locks (a must-see) and restaurants.  The house was in perfect condition when we arrived, and the host provided the information about the home in an e-mail and in person.  There were many goodies in the fridge.  We loved the location because it was convenient to my son, and we could walk to the Locks and the downtown area of Ballard.  The neighborhood was wonderful. Dina was very helpful to us even prior to our arrival. She was cooperative and willing to permit an earlier arrival time. Although we didn\\'t end up needing the early check-in, she was very flexible and responsive to our request. Dina checked in with us a few times during our two week stay and was responsive to our questions throughout our visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, we were happy staying at the Ballard townhouse. The location is fabulous. We were a short walk to the library and a variety of restaurants and shops. The locks and botanical garden are also a short walk away. The year-round farmer\\'s market is fabulous. Be sure to get the doughnuts! They are the best. The location couldn\\'t be better to access all of the fun of Ballard. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we were generally content with our stay, we were intially taken aback by the state of the townhouse. While it was obviously cleaned for us (baths and kitchen tidy, floors swept and vaccuumed, beds freshly made, fresh towels placed in all baths) , it looked a little \"worn\". The walls were banged up (many marks, patched but not painted in a variety of spots) and the carpet had many stains. There was only one picture hanging in the whole house with a number of empty picture hooks throughout. The house generally has the feeling that someone lived there but moved out and left a bunch of stuff behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were several issues with the master bedroom. While there is an overhead ceiling fan and light, the light was not functional. There was a post-it with instructions for the overhead light but at the bottom of the note it said the light may not work so just use the lamps instead. There were two small lamps for lighting but only one lamp worked. Fortunately, the closet light worked. Another issue with the master bedroom is that one of the closet doors had fallen off and was standing in the closet. As this was a safety concern for our two-year old, we had to move the closet door to another safer location. The dressers in both bedrooms were generally not usable. The drawers were either stuck or without bottoms all together. The master closet had nice shelving that we could use and there were some hangers in the closet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kitchen generally had all that we needed with some searching. The kitchen cabinets were full which made it challenging for us since we were staying for two weeks and had brought a few things for our temporary home. We were able to rearrange the cupboards a bit to make space for our items. There was a vareity of items for cooking such as oil and salt and pepper which was very helpful. We were very pleased to have a washer and dryer to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Ballard townhome is in a great location, has a lovely host,  and easily accomodates a large group/family, aesthetically it could use some TLC. \\r\\n\\r\\n Dina\\'s house was a great find for our trip! It truly felt like staying with family. The location was wonderful - being able to walk to restaurants and bars around the house was such a treat! Dina was incredibly responsive to any question that came up. We truly appreciate all the accommodations for our stay! Had a lovely time staying with my family at the townhouse. It was very nice and clean and was fully furnished with everything we needed to for the week we were there. We were even able to cook thanksgiving dinner without any issue! The location and just overall functionality of the townhouse was great, and I would definitely look forward to another opportunity to stay here. Thanks so much for letting us use your home! Kim is a conscientious host and her family\\'s place has all the conveniences you really need. The Wifi signal was excellent, and that\\'s high on my priority list.  The available driveway parking was also a major plus.  And the drive to the central Seattle area was only about 15 to 20 minutes. \\r\\nBonus: bed was comfortable and there\\'s a nice back porch/yard you can enjoy.  Would I stay there again? Yes. \\r\\n\\r\\n A wonderful place to stay. The apartment was clean and quite, very much our own space for the duration of our stay. Our hosts made sure we had everything we needed. We were close to shops and restaurants in the area and just a bus ride away from downtown Seattle. My Dad and kid brother actually stayed here, and they had a wonderful time! The hosts were polite and responsive, and the apartment itself is very comfortable and clean. My brother didn\\'t want to leave! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is quiet, but quite convenient - a little under a mile to get to Old Ballard and the Locks. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe hosts also left a $10 card to a local cafe/bakery (Alison\\'s Coastal Cafe & Bakery, about a 15 min walk away) - delicious crepes and friendly staff! \\r\\n\\r\\nThis place is definitely recommended! Kim and Michael were great, as was the space! We didn\\'t stay long, but felt comfortable, had a great night\\'s sleep, and got some work done with their high speed internet. Oh! And walked to a delish dinner in downtown Ballard.  The place was beautiful and in a great location! Kim met with me at the beginning of our stay, and since we didn\\'t have any problems that was the only interaction that we had. The place was very clean, with fresh linens and bath supplies. She offered us the use of her bikes, coupons for a local brunch spot, and our own off street parking spot. She even left us k-cups, creamer, and sugar for coffee!  Wonderfully appointed, complete basement apartment in a great location, walkable to a revitalized Ballard and the Locks. Kim, Michael and Vivian were perfect hosts, inviting me into their home for dinner, as well as providing a voucher for a local cafe! Kim\\'s suite is immaculate and newly renovated. It\\'s even more lovely than the photos, and the perfect place if you are looking for a quiet, self-contained place to hang your hat in the Ballard hood. NW Market street is minutes away by foot, with a hip Sunday farmer\\'s market and plenty of cafes, bars, and boutiques. For runners and outdoor fans, a loop around nearby Green Lake makes a great workout. Kim has 2 adult bikes for tenant use.\\r\\nKim is a warm, friendly host. She & her family live on-site, so do expect some normal coming & going, but this didn\\'t bother me. There is a lovely backyard patio & green space (great for yoga!). Although a few bits & bobs were missing from the suite\\'s inventory of what I needed to be at home, the space is newly being set-up and I believe Kim will have this sorted soon. I would stay here again. We loved staying with Kim in Ballard! Upon our arrival she greeted us with a thorough tour of the apartment and all relevant info about our stay, including some great tips for local places to visit and a $10 gift card to a local eatery. The apartment itself was perfect for what we needed and while it didn\\'t have a kitchen it was stocked with a hot plate and dishes, a mini fridge and even a casserole dish in the microwave. \\r\\n\\r\\nAside from the place, Ballard is a great neighborhood with several shops and restaurants just a walk away. We would definitely recommend this apartment to others visiting Seattle. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Kim! Apartment very clean and listing accurate.  Kim is very helpfull and responsive.  Overall excellent for older guests.  Cozy with all you need.  We were visiting grand children an did not spend much time in unit.  Excellent Ballard location with off street parking; a real plus! Very safe neighborhood with lots of good restaurants and coffee shops close by. \\r\\n\\r\\n The space was amazing; exactly as listed, with a very homey feel. Kim was a wonderful and gracious host. Communication was great and we felt instantly welcomed. Ballard is a great neighborhood as well. Would highly recommend to friends and family visiting the Seattle area.  The space was excellent. It was immaculately clean, and full of sweet touches. Kim greeted us with recommendations for places to eat and things to do. There was water in the fridge and all of the sheets and towels smelled so clean (really nice if you\\'re on a long trip and living out of a bag!) it\\'s in a great neighborhood with a grocery store close and tons of nice places to eat. I would recommend walking to old Ballard ave which is a diagonal side street with hipster shopping and bars galore. Could\\'ve spent a whole night just eating and drinking there. Couldn\\'t have asked for a better place! Great place to stay. Very roomy, clean, private, and convenient. Hosts were friendly and helpful. Very reasonable for an entire floor of a house with a private entrance. No complaints. Will return. We were visiting our daughter who lives nearby. Ballard is a wonderful walking neighborhood with a good variety of restaurants and shops. The local farmers\\' market was exceptional.   Kim was so great! The place was very cute and cosy. In a great location, perfect for a girls getaway trip! Very clean, we couldn\\'t have asked for a better place. I would definitely stay again.  This was a great place for my husband and I to call home during a long weekend in Seattle. It\\'s a very comfortable apartment to relax and hang out in, and in a cute Ballard neighborhood. Everything was very clean. Kim and her family are wonderful hosts -- they greeted us on arrival to make sure we got in and found everything we needed, and even before we arrived Kim asked if there was anything in particular we would need during out stay (decaf coffee, etc). Overall, really nice space with lots of little touches to make sure you have a pleasant stay.  We had an amazing stay here. Everything we could have needed to feel at home, from an iron to a keurig. The kitchenette had a microwave, toaster oven, skillet and even a plug in single stove. We were supplied with dishes pots and pans for making meals at home and plenty of coffee for mornings.  Kim\\'s apartment was very close to market street which has many cute cafes and hosts the Sunday Ballard market. It\\'s also very close to Golden Gardens for an afternoon on the beach. She had movies for us to watch and a comfortable sofa. There was lots of drawers and closet space for storing clothes. The porch was lovely, going along with the theme of our entire stay. Thanks Kim! Kim welcomed me and was hospitable with her greeting. The apt. was just as the pictures showed.  The neighborhood quite and safe and convenient to restaurants and shops. My husband and I enjoyed our 3 day stay in Seattle at Kim\\'s place. It was roomy, well equipped, and relaxing. We would stay here again I loved staying at Kim\\'s place! The apartment was exactly as described in the summary, and honestly, the photos don\\'t do this place justice. It was perfect! Amazing location, clean, and very comfortable.  Kim \\' s place is much nicer than it appwars. Really it was such a perfect little place, far better than a mid level hotel. Everything is new and we\\'ll thought out. This place was just perfect for us. My fiancée and I came to visit family/friends for the holidays and we\\'re looking for a cozy home base during our stay and that\\'s exactly what we got. Kim was very welcoming and accommodating to our schedule. Would definitely recommend!  Kim was very kind in accommodating us and walking us through the unit. The property and Ballard were both beautiful and convenient. We would stay again. Thank you Kim! Our stay was wonderful and proved to be the perfect spot for us. Kim was there to welcome us and see to it that we had everything we needed.  We would not hesitate to book a future stay or recommend her hospitality to anyone! Kim is a gracious host. The space is very well appointed with more than you\\'ll need. I was there for a week before moving from Seattle. I\\'ll be sure to check this listing first on my trips back!  Kim and the apartment were great.  Ballard is a super neighborhood.  We walked to all sorts of great restaurants and went to the Ballard Locks to watch the boats and birds pretty much every day.  It was also very easily accessible to the rest of Seattle.  We also have family in the area and it was a nice place to sit with them and talk for a while. Kim was a wonderful host. I booked this space for my dad\\'s visit, somewhere where he\\'d be able to have his own space, but close enough to us as we live locally. The accommodations were very comfortable for him, close to coffee shops he was able to walk to and so on. Kim was very understanding when he lost the KEY to the apartment. He\\'s new to AirBnB, what can I say! I would definitely recommend this space for someone visiting.  Great location and very kind hosts The reservation was canceled 123 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. We were welcomed by Kim, who made sure that our stay was very comfortable.  She answered all questions and provided everything we needed.   What a perfect place to stay while visiting Seattle.  The apartment was cozy, clean, and in a convenient location.  We couldn\\'t have been more pleased with the accommodations!  Kim was in touch during our stay to make sure that we had everything we needed.  There was nothing missing  and I would highly recommend the Cozy Ballard Apartment to anyone looking for a home away from home, while in Seattle!   Kim met us as we arrived and gave us a very informative and warm welcome! We knew where everything was and definitely felt like we could treat the place like home for our stay. The apartment was super clean and all we needed for a comfortable stay. To top it off, the area that the apartment is in is rich with things to do! We went to some of the restaurants and sights that Kim suggests on her page and were not disappointed!  My sister and I had a great experience at Kim\\'s place. We were driving into the city and arrived late in the evening, which was no problem. A key was left for us-making the process very easy! The apartment is very cute and clean. It has everything you need for a short visit to Seattle. Although we ate out most meals, it was great to have a kitchen for snacks, drinks etc. \\nThe location of the apartment is perfect. We were able to walk to explore Ballard as well as hop on the bus to easily get to downtown. I can\\'t think of any negative aspects of our stay at Kim\\'s airbnb!  Kim was there to greet us when we arrived and showed us everything we needed to know about the lovely and very cozy apartment. \\r\\nShe went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. We had mentioned in passing that we are tea drinkers. The next day Kim had a kettle for us.\\r\\nThe Ballard neighbourhood is spectacular. The apartment is on a peaceful and beautifully leafy street. Yet, only two blocks away is a lively and interesting street of restaurants, cafes and shops.\\r\\nWe really enjoyed Seattle and this delightful home base made it that much more enjoyable. Great home, beautiful neighborhood.  Plenty of privacy, and easy communication with the host.  Thanks again Kim, our stay was wonderful and would highly recommend this apartment!!!! 5 stars for sure! My first air bnb experience, and it couldn\\'t have been any better! The place is gorgeous and very clean. Kim was great, made me feel welcome and if I needed anything could easily ask! Quick walk to downtown where there is shopping/food ect. I would defenitly stay here again!  Kim and her family were incredibly friendly and welcoming.  It\\'s always awesome to meet great folks willing to open their home and make sure you have everything you need.  The apartment was very comfortable and clean, with the perfect backyard patio to kick back and relax.  This is a great spot for your trip to Seattle.  If you are concerned about only having 1 bed, the couch makes for a great spot to crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a late arrival into Seattle, and Kim was very accommodating with having the apartment ready, and making sure we were able to \"check-in\" a bit later than normal.  Thanks again for the random request of a tape measure!\\r\\n\\r\\nI am on the road over 100 days a year, and can say this place will exceed any travelers needs.  Thanks for a great long weekend and I will definitely spread the word about your apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Billy We had a wonderful time staying in Kim\\'s apartment. Ballard was the perfect jumping off point for exploring Seattle and also feeling part of the neighborhood. Kim was great about communicating everything to us and was responsive to our questions and needs. We would definitely stay here again! We met our hostess only briefly, but she was very hospitable in her email correspondence, almost always responding quickly. Kim is an exceptional host. Very pleasant, helpful and easy to communiate with, both before and during our stay. The apartment is thoughtfully layed out and spotless. Perfect for two people. The neighborhood is charming with colorful flowering plants throughout and with short walks to the downtown bus and to numerous restaurants, pubs, eclcectic cafes, and coffee shops. We thoroughly our stay at Kim\\'s apt. Highly recoommend for the perfect stay in Seattle. Kim\\'s AirBnB was so clean and comfortable, a home away from home.  We brought our one-year-old along on our travels so Kim was thoughtful in providing us a portable crib for him to sleep in.  He especially loved the backyard!  We loved how we had a mini kitchen.  We also loved the location and got the opportunity to visit the amazing Ballard Farmer\\'s Market on Sundays.  We hope to stay here again! Loved the Cozy Ballard Apartment! Very roomy, clean and Kim is a gracious host! She accommodated my late arrival with a smile and even recommended a Cool Lil Restaurant that is now \\'one\\' of my favorites. When back in Seattle, I definitely would return to Kim\\'s Cozy apartment! Thanks Kim!\\r\\n Kim was a huge help in helping us get out of Seattle traffic!  Our GPs failed us, and Kim was there to help (even though I bothered her at work!).  It was great to know that she was concerned about us! Kim\\'s apartment was absolutely perfect for my wife and I\\'s trip to Seattle and our first Airbnb experience. The apartment was just as advertised in the pictures and it was spotless. We had a chance to meet Kim and her wonderful family as they were enjoying the beautiful Seattle weather we had all week! She was an amazing host and provided very helpful tips that helped make our vacation even more enjoyable. The apartment felt very spacious and we had everything we needed. The apartment is only a couple minute walk to a bus stop and a 10-15 minute drive to downtown which made it easy to get around. We would definitely stay with Kim again next time we are in Seattle.   Kim\\'s little apartment was so cute and perfect for our little family (two adults and a toddler). She even put a pack n\\' play out for us, which was super helpful, and our daughter had a great time playing in the backyard with the balls and deck chairs. The location was convenient to the heart of downtown Ballard, easy access to the rest of the city. Excellent breakfast at Allison\\'s with the gift card Kim put out (try the bacon waffle sandwich), but plenty of great food within a 5-10 min walk. Also super easy and quick walk to the Ballard Locks, which is always a favorite.  Great experience for both of us. Good communication, lovely and warm welcome and very accommodating. Very comfortable and clean/nice lodging (also private and private) and great location to Ballard and easy to downtown and beyond. Really nice stay! Lovely extra amenities like bottled water, hairdryer, toiletries and nice linens etc. Kim\\'s Ballard Apartment was wonderful! Kim greeted us for check in, and then we were really able to enjoy our time in Seattle. We found everything extremely clean and loved the side entrance and being able to park the car right there. My wife and I visited Seattle for a wedding and some vacation time and thoroughly enjoyed Kim\\'s cozy Ballard apartment. The space is perfect for a couple (us), and well located to make any place in Seattle easily accessible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe enjoyed walks to dining and parks in this vibrant and neat neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nKim is a gracious, comfortable host and the well appointed apartment is thoughtfully stocked with conveniences. The apartment is perfect, fully stocked and very clean.\\nSo much thought put into making this space modern, functional, and comfortable. \\nCheckin was seamless and even allowed to arrive a little early\\nHad a great welcoming committee (put a huge smile on my face)\\nBikes were available for us to use and worked out great for our tour of Seattle.\\nThe location is perfect, a little bit off the main drag ( good thing)but still close to everything great about the Pacific Northwest. You must have a bonfire at Golden Gardens Beach only about a mile down the street\\nDesignated off street parking was greatly appreciated. \\nKim and the kids were great and very friendly I stayed here while visiting my daughter.  The place is very nicely appointed, in a great safe location and close to great shops ( The Secret Garden bookstore, restaurants and walking distance to parks). Quiet, very clean and comfotable. Kim was great to communicate with for reservations and check in. A really very nice stay. This was our first time using AirBnB and we couldn\\'t be more happy with our experience. The apartment was very clean, well organized and stocked. Kim has thought of everything to make the place feel welcoming, comfortable and cozy. She is a very welcoming and gracious host and happy to accommodate your needs. The apartment has a separate side entrance and place to park the car which really contributes to the feeling of privacy. I could really go on and on about how wonderful we felt staying here. The location is also very convenient as it a walking distance to restaurants and shops. \\r\\nIt is clear from the moment you walk in that Kim loves hosting people and takes a lot of pride in doing it. Next time we come to Seattle we hope to stay at this wonderful cozy apartment again.  All was perfect for our needs. We enjoyed the apartment, and it was quite comfortable and clean. Really liked the Keurig coffee machine for our morning cup. Kim is a great host and went out of her way to make sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed. Apartment was clean, spacious for two and everything had been very well thought out. Location was great and it was nice to have our own parking space. This room would be fine for a quick trip - but really shines with a longer stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing to note is that this is a separate apartment in a larger active family home. It may not be appropriate for all visitors - but it worked great for us and we look forward to staying here again!   We really enjoyed staying at Kim\\'s place! The apartment is perfect for a trip to Seattle, much better than a hotel. Everything was very clean. We didn\\'t have a car, which wasn\\'t a big deal, since there are busses that take you straight downtown. \\nNext time we come to Seattle we hope to stay here again!   The Ballard apartment was perfect for our trip to visit our kids in Seattle. We loved the location-close to coffee shops, restaurants, and great walking paths. The Sunday farmer\\'s market in Ballard is the best. Thanks Kim and family.  It was just awesome! I love this cozy apartment and would definitely recommend it to everyone! Will hopefully stay there again next year :)\\r\\nKim is so friendly and although we arrived 4 hours later there were no complications with the key!  Our stay here was wonderful. Extremely clean and well cared for home. It was easy to get to everything in Ballard on foot. Thank you for the experience! I reserved this unit for my parents while they visited us. Here\\'s their report:\\r\\nWe loved staying here. Cozy Ballard Apartment describes this unit perfectly. It was beautifully furnished, and included a bedroom, bath, kitchen, living and dining room. A sliding glass door opened to a cute backyard with Adirondack chairs, expanding the space. The host provided coffee, water, salt/pepper, and bath essentials. She also changed towels mid-stay. It was a cute neighborhood, and we were able to walk to just about anything we wanted: restaurants, grocery store, movie theater, Farmers Market, and of course, coffee shops. Best of all, we were able walk to the hospital to see our newly-born grandson! We plan to return for many more visits with him, and hope to return to this \"Cozy Ballard Apartment.\" Kim\\'s place was wonderful, so cute and clean and gave me a place to rejuvenate during a busy business trip. I would highly recommend staying here!   Kim\\'s house was the perfect place to come home to while my boyfriend and I searched for our new home in Seattle. It was exactly as pictured, very comfortable and a fantastic location. We were able to walk to nearby restaurants and it was an easy drive to downtown. Although we didn\\'t get to meet in person, we were able to communicate via text and she was very accommodating. Thank you so much for everything, Kim! We loved staying in this cozy studio plus in Ballard! It made traveling for work a lot of fun and was so homey! We\\'re in a hotel now and miss the comfort of this fantastic spot! What an amazing find in a fun neighborhood!  I booked this apartment for a month-long stay for my parents and they had a wonderful experience!   Clean, recently built apartment in a great location - would definitely recommend if you are looking for a private rental with separate bedroom. \\r\\n\\r\\n-Kim, the host, was friendly and easy to coordinate with early on.  Since I was renting for my parents\\' visit once my baby arrived, I had a lot of questions.  She was very responsive and also willing to accommodate some shift in dates (e.g. in case our baby arrived early/late and the unit wasn\\'t already booked)\\r\\n\\r\\n-The apartment is essentially the first/ground floor of a home - it sits behind the garage, and the family lives upstairs.  The family was very quiet and my parents never had any issues (note- they were at my house most days, and back at the rental in evenings)\\r\\n\\r\\n-Location!  If you are looking to stay in an amazing Seattle neighborhood, you\\'ll have a great experience in Ballard, and this apartment is walking distance to everything.  Within a short walk (about 10 minutes) you\\'d have access to all of the great restaurants and charming shops in historic downtown Ballard.  You are also in walking distance to the Ballard Locks, one of Seattle\\'s top attractions, and where you can see Salmon migrate in the summer through an underground fish ladder :)   Kim\\'s place was absolutely perfect the bed was amazing it was so comfortable .  Lots of privacy wonderful hot water for the shower .  Kim also had a bicycle for me to use if I needed it .  I will Certainly stay again !! She communicates clearly about keys, parking, departure, provides bottled water, Keurig coffee supplies.  The place was great and perfect for my business trip. Very comfortable and the bottle of water were much appreciated. Thanks so much. Kim\\'s place was perfect! It was walking distance to everything - my brother\\'s house as well as eateries, bus stop, market and the Ballard Locks. The place itself had all the necessities such as a living room and a small kitchen area. There was a small oven so my boyfriend and I were able to heat up some pie that we got from the Ballard Farmer\\'s market! It truly was a little home away from home. We can\\'t wait to go back! Our group loved staying here. Mercy was totally accommodating with times to check-in and check-out. The house was exactly as advertised, with some great additions not even really highlighted (cork flooring, take a beer leave a beer policy, plenty of privacy, close to stores/bars/etc.). And with 7 people it was more than enough space.  Wonderful stay, home was beautiful and very cool Neighborhood. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  This is a FANTASTIC house. We were 5 adults and two children and we had plenty of room (we rented the main house and the basement apartment). It is in fantastic condition. The kitchen is enormous and has everything you could possibly want. We made a meal for 15 one evening and it was a not a problem at all. There are toys galore for children and laundry facilities as well. Ballard is a great neighborhood and it\\'s easy to get downtown, easy access to the airport, safe, and convenient. The systems worked great including lots of TV options. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.  The Plum Modern house was ideally suited for a recent trip to Seattle for a family wedding. With ten adults and two children coming in from various states, staying at Plum Modern allowed us to stay together as a family, prepare and eat meals together, and was only minutes from the wedding venue. We all took turns exploring the neighborhood and shopping at the local stores. The kids enjoyed playing with available toys and eveyone pulled books out to read on especially rainy evenings. We even got to enjoy a little time in the hot tub - such gorgeous views from the roof! We were all grateful for the opportunity to stay together at Plum Modern, and several of us discussed renting the apartment at some point in the future when we return to visit the bride and groom. :) The place was gorgeous and really nice. We loved how well everything was labeled (the documentation for the place is fantastic). We used it as a work retreat and found it quite spacious. We\\'ll definitely reconsider the place for a future Seattle visit. Mckinzy\\'s apartment is adorable. Great place to walk around Ballard and call an Uber and head down to Capitol Hill. She was a great host. Met us upon arrival, handed us the key, and left us detail instructions. Very useful. We will definitely book this listing again. And by the way, she left us wine and flowers. Also, her place smells amazing, like lavender. Great touch! Host made us feel so welcome by offering perfect amenities for our 5-night stay.  So well-organized, clean and all the necessities one would need.  Nicely-decorated and had incredible taste.   Amazing apartment and great location!\\r\\nMckinzy was very communicative  from beginning to end.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend her to anyone.\\r\\n Great location, nice place!  My wife and had a great time getting to know the Ballard neighborhood spots, with plenty of fun places easily within walking distance.  Farmers Market was awesome, thanks for the recommendation Mckinzy! Mckinzy was very easy to contact and communicate with. The apartment was cute and in a great location - easy walking distance to tons of bars and restaurants (and there was a great list of local recs from the hosts). However, we were a little bummed to arrive and realize there was no closet available and nowhere else to unpack or even put our suitcases (the bed takes up the entire room) - if you\\'re traveling with bigger bags (or more than one suitcase), expect a tight fit. Also don\\'t expect to watch the news - while there was a TV in the apartment, it\\'s not hooked up to any devices (cable, DVD player, etc), so we were a little let down that when we chose to stay in for a night,  hanging out to watch a movie or show wasn\\'t an option for us... Although I didn\\'t personally meet Andrea during my stay due to her work hours, I did get to exchange a few messages with her and she seems to be a very friendly person. I did get to meet her boyfriend, David, who was an awesome host and very accommodating during my stay there. He gave a tour of the house and recommended great places around the area to go to. Andrea had everything prepared for my guest and I (a sweet note, towels and extra toiletries). The room which was located on the basement floor was cozy and the bed was super comfortable, definitely got a good night sleep. Both Andrea and her bf made my guest and I feel right at home. They gave us the space and privacy we needed, but at the same time seem very personable and approachable. Ballard was a great neighborhood to stay at (plenty of restaurants, bars, little shops) and not too far from downtown Seattle. I very much enjoyed my stay at Andrea\\'s place and would definitely recommend it! :) Andrea and David were amazing hosts. Communication was very open and easy. They let us know that they will interact act as much or as little per our discretion. So it being our first time in Washington, we asked for tons of suggestions of what to do, very very helpful and tons of great suggestions be it night life, sight seeing, food, breweries, public transit, etc. \\r\\n      The home is cozy, but very lovely and clean. Our room was the basement, which my girlfriend and I loved, as having our own space made us really feel at home. The temp. in the room was always perfect, the bed was very comfortable, and there was a welcome basket for us with basic hygiene necessities, as well as an awesome welcome message from Andrea and David. The room has its own entrance, which is awesome because we never felt like we had to tip toe when coming in late. Their backyard/garden was very relaxing. The neighborhood was awesome! 10 minute walk from all types of amazing restaurants and bars!  The day of our departure, my girlfriend and I spent our last hour drinking coffee and chatting with the both of them. Such a lovely couple, truly enjoyed our stay and the whole experience, would definitely stay again.\\r\\n This is a warm and welcoming home with lots of charm! They\\'ve made a great effort to provide a cozy atmosphere - great location, and the backyard is a magic garden! We had a lovely time! Much needed rest and relaxation at this precious ballard cottage. It was nice to have a private room with separate entrance and amazing garden backyard. They were wonderful hosts, making us feel  welcomed and comfortable. Thank you! Andrea and her boyfriend went out of their way to be friendly and offer advice about visiting Seattle. Thank you! She made me feel very welcome, so did David her boyfriend.  He made delicious coffee for me. Cute neighborhood-within walking distance of everything! Andrea and David were very nice and accommodating. The room was exactly as pictured. The dogs were friendly, but definitely barked a lot when we arrived (and the owners weren\\'t home) and when we came and went.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe appreciated that there was ample street parking, too! Fun neighborhood with a bunch of cool things to check our within walking distance. House was warm and cozy. Hosts were courteous, welcoming and made an extra effort to make sure I felt as ease in the common spaces. Basement room was warm, clean and very comfortable. Great neighborhood with plenty of shops and amenities within walking distance. Definitely plan to stay here again.  This was my first Airbnb experience and it could not have been more enjoyable. Andrea and David (and their friendly dog Baker!) made us feel so welcome as soon as we stepped in their adorable cottage. They also made amazing recommendations on things to do and places to eat! I highly  recommend this airbnb! Andrea and David were very sweet and attentive! Nice apt, very warm and cozy. Sweet dog and amazing location!  My friend and I had a great stay here!! Unfortunately Andrea was out of town, so we couldn\\'t meet her- but her boyfriend David was an absolute joy. Very warm, welcoming and fun to talk to. He was great at helping us out in finding nearby places to check out. I wish we had had more than a day to spend here, but maybe next time! I would totally stay here again. Very homey, cute little house with some charm and quirk. Reasonably priced and comfortable. And their dog Baker is just a little love!! What a cutie. I definitely recommend staying here :) Perfectly situated a few blocks from everything in Ballard this room was absolutely what we needed on this vacation. As a guest you get a great amount of privacy as the room is on a completely different floor from everything else. Andrea and David are great hosts; they lay out food and coffee for you in the morning and they give the best advise on what to do in Ballard. We had a great time, loved the room, couldn\\'t have asked for a better location in Ballard and would return anytime they will have us. My boyfriend and I loved staying with Andrea and David. The house was very clean and cute. Hosts provided lovely homemade scones and other breakfast goods as well as toiletries and great recommendations. We would absolutely stay with them again. Andrea, David and Baker provided such a welcoming and friendly environment while we transitioned between houses. They made sure we had everything we needed and were always available for questions and conversation when everyone was at the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir home was cozy but the room is private and comfortable. We couldn\\'t have asked for a better couple to stay with for the week! We were familiar with the area but for anyone new to Seattle or Ballard they have good suggestions for local things to do. Description accurate! Cute cottage in a cool neighbourhood. Andrea and David were so friendly and helpful! Scones for breakfast and daily advice for where to go in the city and how to get there. Really great. Andrea and David we\\'re very welcoming. Both are engaged in timely environmental work. Quaint small home in the interesting hood of Ballard. The private getaway room in the basement provided the basic comforts and privacy, complete with Wi-fi, to make the stay enjoyable. Good luck to both of them. It is indeed in the middle of everything! Located in the lovely Ballard neighborhood, Lauren\\'s B&B is only a 10 minute drive from popular downtown locations including the Space Needle, is next to a 7-11 convenience store for quick restock, and is within walking distance of awesome Ballard shops. Lauren and Gabriel are also super friendly too! \\r\\n\\r\\nHighly recommended especially if you are planning to explore Seattle with a car The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Lauren, Gabe, and their children were great hosts during our stay in Seattle. I had previously used an airbnb location in Magnolia which I loved, but it was booked this time around so I hoped Lauren and Gabe\\'s place in Ballard would be as wonderful and it did not disappoint.\\n\\nExtremely safe neighborhood, extremely close to many big bus lines including 2 direct lines to downtown, and there is even a downtown area a few blocks down from the apartment with major nightlife of its own. \\n\\nI didn\\'t spend much time in the apartment during the day but it was a quiet place to sleep which looked exactly like the pictures and I slept more soundly than I ever do at home.\\n\\nThank you Lauren and family! :) I appreciate Lauren accommodating us (party of 4) in such short notice. Lauren is pleasant, hospitable, flexible, and unobtrusive. Her home is located in the heart of Ballard near area amenities and attractions. The rooftop deck offers a relaxing oasis above the city streets. Overall, a prime spot with a fantastic host. The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Lauren and her family were the perfect hosts! Their place in Ballard is comfy, clean and modern and her family were very welcoming and very lovely! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is fantastic, close to so many bars and restaurants, perfectly safe and minutes away from the downtown bus. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to stay in Seattle!  Good Lauren was very kind and accommodating. My friends and I loved the neighbourhood!  This is the worst experience with Airbnb, we shared a two bedrooms with Lauren\\'s faimillies with 3 kids and a dog, they go out of their bedroom then we are out of the apartment and go back to the bedroom when we come back, which makes us feel not friendly and uneasy, well we still smell the unpleasant smell of the dog. They didn\\'t wash their dishes and damp the gabage bin  in time as well in the kitchen. The most unfriendly thing is that we can not even leave our heavy bags at her home after 11:00 in the morning of the day we leave back home, which she has mentioned when I check in and let us feel very not friendly, and that is not imaginalble that we hadn\\'t access to the WIFI in such a modern day! I will never come back and live in any Airbnb apartments! La habitación estaba muy limpia y tranquilo. La ubicación es perfecta. Algo fuera del centro de  Seattle, pero uno llega muy rápido y fácil con el transporte al centro. Y en la tarde se puede disfrutar la tranquilidad de Ballard.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMuy recomendable. Lauren\\'s kids are adorable and the free parking was great and it was also great to be able to walk to old Ballard neighborhood and all the seaside parts on Puget Sound. What a fun city! Lauren was very kind during our stay. The room is clean and the location is close to lots of fun restaurants and shops in the Ballard area.  Lauren and her husband were very welcoming and helpful! I was admittedly a little wary as this was our first time using Airbnb but everything went smoothly. We had 4 adults packed into the room so it was a little tight but we made due. The 3 kids were all very well behaved and quiet. Lauren and Gabe\\'s place was in a great location. It was safe and secure and both of them were very kind and friendly. Having a parking space available was a huge bonus! Thank Gabe and Lauren for waiting us until midnight. The apartment is very nice. The room was very clean. It was a nice experience! Overall, we had a great experience! We were only looking for a place to sleep for a cheap price in a clean place - this is exactly what we found! The place is right next to a RapidRide bus stop, which was perfect for getting downtown. There were a ton of shops, cafes, and restaurants a walk down the street. Lauren and her family were very sweet and helpful. They pretty much just let us do our own thing and gave us plenty of privacy, which was fine! Our room was clean and quaint. The fans in the room kept it at the perfect temperature. The only thing that was kind of a hassle was when my friend went back to the condo during the day to use the restroom and the dogs were in there. He didn\\'t want to mess with them, so he had to go somewhere else - but obviously this is not a big deal, just something to communicate! Like I said, we had a great experience! Lauren and her family went out of their way to make our experience comfortable and convenient. The space was small, but nice. Thank you! Lauren\\'s place was perfect for where we wanted to be in Ballard.. Easy walk to stores, restaurants and bars.  Easy access to buses for a quick trip downtown .. Very nice host with all of the accommodations we needed Lauren and Gabe are excellent hosts. The whole place was beautiful and very clean, laundry access was a big plus, dinner on the rooftop was fun. The family was real quiet and accommodating. Highly recommend staying here if you\\'re willing to share a space with the hosts.  This place is in a great location in Ballard! The rooftop area with bbq is quite nice and if you have time to use the small gym, it also looked nice! \\nThe apartment itself was, however, a bit of a disappointment. Just very awkward... Basically this is their 3 small children\\'s bedroom complete  with bunk beds and hard mattresses that becomes your room.  I am not opposed to bunk beds. The hard mattress, however,  was not great nor was I sure the blankets on the shelves were clean. The first one I pulled out did not smell at all good.  There was nothing but a fitted sheet on the bed. No pillow. Nothing. I didn\\'t think there was a door at all when I arrived because it slides along the wall with no way to lock it. \\nWhile Gabe was friendly and took me on a little tour when I got there, I didn\\'t find Lauren particularly nice. \\nYou have to walk across the kitchen and living area to get to your room. (All five of them and the two dogs retreat to the other bedroom.) \\nThere is a hamster or gerbil with a squeaky wheel that I listened to for a while that night. At some point he was also brought into their room. I was grateful for that but, again, just awkward... Quite easy to feel like you are inconveniencing them. \\nThe bathroom is over next to their room. The thought of taking up the bathroom with five other people waiting was a bit off putting. I did not shower. \\nIn addition, while I think it\\'s a great thing to homeschool, knowing all three kids were home all the time and I was occupying their room did not leave me feeling secure or that my things would be left untouched by little hands, even if the kids were all very sweet. (They\\'re still small curious children.) \\nI did not complete my stay. In fact I only stayed one night of the three I\\'d booked. It was all just too awkward... Thank you, Gabe, for trying. \\nI really hesitated in leaving a review but I got numerous reminders to please do so from airbnb and I guess I feel other people should know my experience. I texted Lauren twice upon my departure to talk to her about my experience. She did get back to me. Kind of the attitude I found from her while I was there as well. I\\'m sorry it couldn\\'t be a more positive review. The perfect spot to stay in if you\\'re looking to explore the Ballard area. We really enjoyed our stay here, and would definitely stay here again. Very clean and easy to get to. No Wi-Fi in the house though, but easy to find at local cafes and bars and breweries. And there are a lot of breweries nearby! Awful experience! I was looking forward to staying at Lauren\\'s; however, she was unresponsive, and after several hours, I let her know that if I didn\\'t hear from her I\\'d have to make a reservation with a different host. She did not reply to that message until after I had made another reservation. I requested she cancel the reservation as it was the fair thing to do. Only THEN did I get a reply that basically stated she has a strict cancelation policy, refusing to work with me. Note she has a mere 40% response rate. I feel absolutely cheated by her and airbnb.  Avoid.  The reservation was canceled 43 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Great little house! We had a perfect stay and loved being close to the action in Ballard. Also loved the outdoor space.  Fleur was extremely helpful in helping us plan our trip.  I loved staying at Fleur\\'s house.  It is in my favorite part of the city, Ballard neighborhood!  It is a lovely and comfortable home.  She had everything I needed for my 5 day stay.  I would definitely stay there again! Fleur was easy to make arrangements with, and her cottage is a perfect, cozy place to stay in Seattle. The location is convenient to so many great neighborhoods and activities. Thanks Fleur for a wonderful stay! Fleur\\'s place was perfect for us and we were really happy we decided to stay in Ballard so we could spend our two days in Seattle exploring this great neighbourhood. Fleur\\'s place was really well located, easy walking distance to everything. It was also full of character and felt very  homey. It was a pleasure meeting Fleur towards the end of the trip. Fleur is a great host. Easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Her place is close to all the action in Ballard. The house is well equipped, spacious, and comfortable. I would recommend her place to anyone visiting Seattle. Absolutely loved Fleur\\'s little Ballard cottage! (We would have left you flowers, Fleur, but we ran out of time!) My girlfriend and I stayed a weekend as we attended a workshop in the Greenwood area and this was the perfect hide-out. Market Street with it\\'s coffee shops, restaurants and bars is all within easy walking distance. The house was lovely and clean... and the little kitchen well equipped. I will definitely stay there again! What a terrific location! We loved it~it\\'s an especially perfect house for someone who is young and laid back. We walked all over Ballard to restaurants, Ballard Market, Farmer\\'s market, galleries, bars...it was great. Took the bus to the city and Car2go is a a good alternative,too. We had rented a car and never had a problem with parking out front.  Fleur\\'s cottage was very clean and comfy. It is in an excellent location central to everything in Ballard. We would stay there again next time we visit the city.  Fleur did a great job of creating a cute and comfortable home for us to stay in. Her cottage is convenient to Seattle hotspots, not least of which her immediate neighborhood. The beds were comfortable and she was a friendly and accommodating host. Fleur\\'s place is awesome! You couldn\\'t ask for a better spot in Ballard. I look forward to coming back again. Fleur\\'s house was perfect!  Very cozy and great location.  1 block to a grocery store and great breakfast/coffee place, and lots of restaurants just a couple blocks away.  Both the bed and futon were comfortable (4 female friends slept there comfortably) and the house was charming.  I highly recommend it.  Such a cozy place, everything we needed for our weekend get away and a perfect location to hanging out in Ballard. Fleur was very helpful and accommodating to our plans. We stayed at this cute outage in Ballard during a visit to family there. The cottage is in a great location, close to shops, cares and restaurants.  The cottage was clean and comfortable.  We hope to be able to stay here again next time we visit!! Fleur\\'s cute house was wonderful for our stay over Christmas.  Everything was so clean and cozy....  We did a little cooking and even walked to Old Ballard for dinner. \\r\\nThanks Fleur!       We had a great stay! In spite of record-setting cold weather, Fleur\\'s cottage was warm and cozy when we arrived!  Everything was great, and we really enjoyed our stay.  We\\'ll probably stay here again, as we regularly visit the area. Just finished a weekend trip at the cottage with another couple. There was enough room for all four of us and the location was within walking distance to great pubs and restaurants. We didn\\'t get a chance to meet fleur but her home was a great spot and a welcome change to a tiny hotel room. No issues, great trip.  The reservation was canceled 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. The cottage is exactly as pictured ... a little house with 2 bedrooms, a separate living room and kitchen and a little back yard.  You are a block away from food, coffee, etc.  Fleur was a great host.  We enjoyed our stay and will stay again next time in Seattle. Enjoyed our stay.  The beds were comfortable and the location cannot be beat.  There was a fully stocked kitchen although we only used some glasses and French press.  24 hour grocery within 2 blocks and we walked to restaurants, too.  Fleur met us there and she was very nice and filled us in on what to do.  She also answered our questions during the stay via email.  Highly recommend! Great location and great place if you have kids. \\n\\nWalking distance from anything you might need and less than 10 minutes to downtown. Lost of parks in the area and very family friendly. Fleur\\'s home was a wonderful place to relax and unwind during our trip to Seattle for a wedding. Her home is cozy and offered great space for the four of us who were staying there. The location was fantastic, as it was a 10 minute walk to the actual ceremony. The bus took us straight to Pike Place market in a direct route and allowed us all to see parts of the city we normally passed by on the I-5. We spent Saturday morning in Ballard at the markets and had a surprisingly great breakfast from the Smoke Shop diner. We were all very happy with our experience, spending a beautiful, hot weekend in Seattle. Our group of 4 visited Seattle and had a very comfortable stay at Fleur\\'s cottage.  The neighborhood was great for walking to get dinner/drinks after a long day out.  The living room/kitchen area was roomy enough to hang out and chat or have a few beers too.  There is even room to sit outside.  All of my friends loved the cottage and, to my knowledge, slept comfortably.  We definitely chose the right accommodations for our trip. My family really enjoyed staying in Fleur\\'s cottage. It was clean, charming, and comfortable. Its location was really great - a convenient walk to a very good grocery store and perfect for exploring downtown Ballard. The whole family walked to the Farmer\\'s Market on Sunday morning. Given the very warm weekend, we thought the house stayed cool enough to relax in during the afternoon, ventilated only by fans.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleur was also a pleasure to work with in renting the cottage. She was very quick to respond to messages and left very organized and clear instructions in using the cottage\\'s amenities.   Fleur\\'s cottage couldn\\'t have been a better find. The location was perfect, one block from a grocery store and 2 blocks from the center of Ballard. The house had everything we needed and was very welcoming. The rooms and amenities were as described and we definitely felt like we were staying at a friend\\'s house. We\\'d love to stay again next time we travel to Seattle. Fluer,\\r\\nLoved your information book for guests.  Very helpful.\\r\\nThis is a charming cottage & we enjoyed our stay.  Thanks for calling to check with us that all was OK.\\r\\nThis home is conveniently located, close to Seattle downtown, & Ballard has a charm of its own, with some excellent restaurants, & a particularly good children\\'s toy store, Clover.\\r\\nBallard Farmer\\'s Market is great.  Much smaller than Pike Street Market, with more charm, & smaller crowds.\\r\\nDue to the number of steps up to the cottage, it would not be convenient for those with disabilities. Wow what a great place! Unfortunately we did not get to Meet Fleur as she was away for the weekend, but she made a great remote host. She was communicative from the beginning and continued to be so during our stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe place was perfect for our needs. The two bedrooms were exactly what we needed for both couples on our trip and each had comfy beds. The common areas had everything we needed to unwind in-between outings (the new couch in the living room is über-comfortable) and the whole cottage had a great cozy atmosphere. It felt lived in and loved, but was still neat and clean. I particularly enjoyed the art and decorations (props for the skateboards and theater seats!) scattered throughout. Something to keep in mind is that this is actually a cottage and not a full-sized house, but as long as you don\\'t have large group, or don\\'t mind doubling up, it\\'s perfect. A picture of this place should be found next to the dictionary definition of quaint :)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the location: Parking was really the only aspect that left more to be desired, however this was mostly due to a lot of construction in the neighborhood, and Fleur was very upfront concerning this. The cottage is located in a sweet neighborhood called Ballard about 10-15 min away from downtown, but has a bunch of stuff to do and see in its own right (which Fleur was happy to list out in her extensive info binder) and we had just as much fun exploring the surrounding area as we did the usual tourist hangouts. \\r\\n\\r\\nI definitely would not mind staying here again, and in all likeliness will probably seek it out on my next trip to the area.  We loved our stay at Fleur\\'s place.  It was clean, well-supplied, cozy and welcoming.  Very pretty too and the location was so convenient.  Just a block to many facilities in Ballard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 4 of us felt that we were at our own home and our 4 days passed too quickly.  We give the cottage our highest recommendation. Our group of four enjoyed staying at Fleur\\'s cozy home.  It is very conveniently located near bike trails, the locks,  and the community center where our training was held.  It is also a short walk from wonderful dining options which Fleur nicely outlined in her welcome book. \\nWe especially loved her quaint and well equipped kitchen! The cast iron skillets were a huge bonus! We loved the fresh flowers throughout her space. There was plenty of space in the refrigerator too (perfect for the daily meals we prepared).\\nThe shower had good water pressure,  and the bedrooms were comfortable.  We appreciate having the fans as one of the rooms got hot during the night. \\nAlthough we never met Fleur, we felt very much at home in her space. She checked in with us the day after we arrived and made herself available via phone of we needed. \\n\\nWe did arrive at her home later than we had originally planned so, it was dark, parking was a bit awkward, but we were able to work things out.\\n\\nWe would definitely recommend Fleur\\'s cozy cottage as a great place to stay and a very reasonable price! We really enjoyed the Ballard neighborhood.  We were able to walk to alot of restaurants, coffee places and shopping.  The house is in a nice, safe enviroment.  It has street parking, so sometimes couldnt park right in front but no problems finding a spot.  The house was nice but a little cool in the livingroom, luckily the room had a heater.   We had a wonderful stay at Fleur\\'s home. It is the perfect size for two couples and is very conveniently located. We had no issues with parking. Fleur was very responsive and provided great recommendations. We would stay there again in a heartbeat! Fleur went out of her way to welcome us to her cute cottage on very short notice when we came to town after the birth of our grand baby. The cottage was perfect for our needs, clean, great location, and very cozy. The neighborhood was quiet, and walking distance from anything we needed. We would very much recommend this cottage, and Fleur as a gracious host. Staying at Fleur\\'s place was a real pleasure for us. Located in one of the nicest areas of the city, we felt at home immediately and enjoyed our evenings in the house a lot. It is a very clean and tidy place with more than enough room for four to five people to stay in. Communication with Fleur was a bit difficult as she was not in the house and could not be contacted via phone but we were able to communicate with her upon our arrival, so that was not a big problem either.\\r\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend the cottage if you are looking for a neat little place in one of the nicer and less busy areas of the city. The host canceled this reservation 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Upon arriving at Fleur\\'s place, we were happy to find a clean cottage with all household items provided. The beds were very comfortable and the other rooms were just perfect for our needs. The cottage is located within walking distance to everything in Ballard. Unfortunately  we did not get to meet our host Fleur but were able to communicate as needed. This accommodation was perfect for us and we would definitely recommend this place to others.  Fleur was very welcoming and met me for a tour of the place before my family arrived, who would be staying at her place. The house was very clean with plenty of linens and kitchen tools. The location was wonderful because you can walk to downtown Ballard in 3 blocks! Fleur\\'s home was just as described.  Our family of four was really comfortable and enjoyed all the great neighborhood of Ballard had to offer.  We hope to come back again soon. Great peaceful little sanctuary in Ballard. Fleur was easy, flexible and professional. Absolutely recommend! We had a really lovely stay at Fleur\\'s home in Ballard, great location for someone who wants to explore this neighborhood! Super easy check in & out! Really cozy feel, would definitely recommend! Great location and super cute place! Fleur was a very sweet host and made us feel so welcome.  Our family of three had a magical time staying at Fleur\\'s place. She clearly is good at what she does.  The place is so charming and accommodating.  The neighborhood is highly walkable, and street parking was never an issue.  Thanks for providing such delightful accommodations for us, Fleur.  Fantastic place in a fantastic neighborhood.  Great cottage within walking distance of shops, bars, restaurants, and grocery stores.  Clean & cottage with all the amenities you would need.  Would stay again in a heartbeat. Our group of four had a wonderful stay in Fleur\\'s sweet little cottage in Ballard. The cottage was clean and comfortable, with everything we needed for a laid back weekend. The location was great, an easy walk to lots of good restaurants and bars. Highly recommend! We loved staying at Fleur\\'s house! Our beds were comfy & we love Fleur\\'s cottage style. Everything we needed was available. Eateries and entertainment are only a couple of blocks away. Parking skills come in handy! Thanks Fleur! We enjoyed our stay. Thank you for the wonderful cottage.  We loved the lcoation in Ballard and loved the homey feel of this place.  Fleur also left a book with great recommendations of places to go and see in the surrounding area! I was Lauren and Martin\\'s first AirBnB guest and it was really great staying with them. Their house is in a superb location with a super short walk to one of the best neighborhoods (Ballard) in Seattle. Lauren and Martin are great, always ready to help and answer any questions. I stayed for almost 2 weeks, so it was great to also use their washer and dryer. The room and bathroom are on the bottom floor where you enter the house, so you kind of have your own area, if you like some privacy. The room has a nice futon bed, a closet and while it\\'s not super big, it\\'s definitely good for 2 people. The bathroom is really nice. In fact the whole house is really nice and pretty new. Stay there. you won\\'t regret it! :) Location, location, location!  If you are staying in Ballard this is the perfect location.  You are right off Market Street and everything is easily walkable, tons of bars, restaurants, the movie theater, and the QFC grocery store.  Martin and Lauren live upstairs so you have plenty of privacy downstairs with your own bedroom, bathroom, and patio.  The only minor drawback was the curtains in the room, they were not room darkening and since I was coming from a completely different time zone it would have been nice or it to be a little darker when I wanted to nap.  Lauren is very friendly and made me feel welcome. Martin and Lauren were very nice to let me relax and hang out until it was time for the little one to go to bed. Then I went out to get dinner in downtown Ballard, which provides a great selection of dinning possibilities. Fantastic location, very friendly hosts. Who could ask for more? Perfect location and lovely hosts.. The room is great for anyone looking for an affordable room in Ballard. I was within walking distance of anything and was able to come and go as I wanted. Had a great weekend because I had such fantastic accommodations. Thanks Lauren and Martin!  I had a great stay at Martin & Lauren\\'s recently! \\r\\nLauren welcomed me on the day of my arrival and made sure that I felt comfortable in their home. The room (which opens on a quiet little private patio) is fully furnished, very comfy (great bed) and spacious enough to contain all of your belonging. There\\'s a nice and clean adjacent bathroom for the guest\\'s use only. \\r\\nThe place is located only steps away from delicious restaurants and boutiques. I really like Ballard, it\\'s like no other places I\\'ve ever been to.\\r\\nFor a first time in Seattle, I could not ask for more. I wish I could have spent some time with my hosts and get to know more about the locals but I brought work with me and needed privacy--they respected that.\\r\\nI definitely recommend that place! Very comfortable and clean bedroom and bathroom to yourself, separate from the main part of the house. Martin & Lauren are very gracious and accommodating and their toddler is adorable :) It is so easy to walk to the central part of Ballard and to take the bus to downtown Seattle, which I did several times. Street parking for my rental car was so easy! I parked right across the street from their house. I highly recommend this listing! I had a nice stay on Martin & Lauren\\'s 1st floor.  Sleep was very peaceful and I got to stretch and eat in the backyard.  They are also great hosts, working with my plans and being comfortable yet giving me a bubble of space. We only stayed two nights at Martin and Lauren, but we found the accomodation comfortable, and as described. I would only like to add, that, although it did not bother us, there were two cats that came in and out of our room, and it might not be a good place for people allergic to cats.\\r\\nMonique Davies Really enjoyed my first Airbnb stay! Lauren and Martin were kind, friendly, and flexible with my travel schedule. Their house is on a quiet street within walking distance of a lot of great stuff in Ballard, and I never felt unsafe in the neighborhood. If you\\'re apartment hunting in Ballard, like I was, you don\\'t need to rent a car: this location has really convenient access to downtown Ballard, a grocery store, and a bus stop. I\\'m wary of futons, but this one slept 2 people quite comfortably. Martin and Lauren\\'s condo was really convenient to all of the places we wanted to visit.  The space for Airbnb guests is private - a 3/4 bath and bedroom - and has access to a little patio.  Lauren was flexible and easy to be in touch with about arriving and departing.  All in all, a really pleasant stay with nice people.  As others have noted -- there are two cats so if you are allergic this might not be the place for you!  A great first Airbnb experiene for us.   Martin and Lauren\\'s place was great! Very clean and has easy private access to the room. A perfect location to stay while spending time in Ballard! We really enjoyed to stay at Martin\\'s & Lauren\\'s place. The room had a big french window with access to the nice terrace.Most of all we liked To stay close to the the area of Ballard, where you can find a plenty of Cafés, bars and shops. Also the Place is not too far away from the buslines which bring you To the City Center. Highly recommended!! My friend and I were heading to Ballard for a concert and booked Martin & Lauren\\'s place last minute.  It was smaller than I expected, but it was comfy, cozy and just what we needed.  Having a private bathroom was great, and the patio was a real bonus.  The cats were curious about us so did visit a fair bit, but we didn\\'t mind so left the door open.\\r\\nLauren was flexible with our check in/out and communication with her was a breeze.  We were given our own key so we could come in and out on our own accord which was great.  I will definitely keep this spot in mind for future one or two night stays. Great place to stay. The location is awesome if you want to be in Ballard: just off Market St, and a very short walk to Ballard Ave. Plenty of on-street parking nearby. The room was small but nice, with a private bathroom. We would be happy to stay here again. This was a great place to stay! Super clean and comfortable and the location made it really easy to get to Ballard.  Everything was just as on the photos. The place is situated really central to everything you\\'d want out of Ballard; good food, good coffee and good bars. Lauren was a gracious host and was flexible with our arrival time. The room was clean and tidy as pictured. In addition, it was walking distance to a lot of great restaurants in the Ballard area (The Walrus & the Carpenter, La Isla, & Ballard Pizza Company just to name a few). While the futon was comfortable and is easily able to accommodate two, my boyfriend who is over 6\\' found that the futon was a bit short in length. He managed though :) Martin and Lauren were welcoming. The bed was comfortable and the coziness of the room encouraged us to explore.  Ballard is a fun and interesting neighborhood, walking distance away.  The #40 bus took us easily to the more touristy areas. My girlfriend and I had a great experience for the day we stayed at Martin\\'s listing. The room was very clean and comfortable. Also the listing was in a great location, walking distance from cool shops and bars, as well as a very short drive to the beach. Great hosts, super accommodating, and very friendly. The space was totally private, superbly located and close to transit.\\n\\nI\\'d absolutely stay there again. Our stay at Lauren and Martin\\'s place was nice. The room and bathroom were exactly what we were expecting. It\\'s a good place to stay if you\\'re planning on spending most of your time outside, exploring Seattle.  My partner and I stayed for 2 nights at this location. The Ballard neighborhood is definitely up and coming - with many coffee shops, restaurants, and bars in the area within walking distance; however, if you would like to go downtown it can take some time without a car. To be fair, we didn\\'t use public transportation, we rented a car. If you intend to rent a car parking is fantastic and free around the area - we had no issues regardless of the time of day. The room was as advertised, very clean and neat, the host Lauren was very warm, friendly, flexible, and easygoing. The room was on the main floor and we felt as though we had our own private apartment with a patio. Would absolutely stay with them again!  I had a great experience at Lauren and Martin\\'s listing. The room is private and über clean and their house is centrally located in Seattle\\'s Ballard neighborhood - within 3 minutes from a cute coffee shop and bus stop that takes you downtown. There are also other restaurants and shops within walking distance. Lauren and Martin were wonderful and accommodating hosts. I would definitely stay here again.  We really had a great time at Martin\\'s place. Martin and Lauren were really friendly, and ready to help us. The house is located in a great neighbourhood with lots of restaurants and bars. The bedroom is clean and the bed confortable, the private bathroom is a big plus. We stayed 3 nights and I will definately stay again ! Martin and Lauren were wonderful hosts and have a great setup in Ballard. It\\'s a cozy room- perfect for one or two people. The fun hip vibe of Ballad is a couple of blocks in one direction and the Chittenden Locks are a couple of blocks in the other (definitely worth a visit!). If you\\'re active, we recommend getting a hold of bikes (Martin and Lauren graciously let us borrow theirs in exchange for putting a little TLC into them!).  Crossing the locks with your bike can take you into downtown (about 6 miles) or the Burke-Gilman trail in the other direction can take you into Fremont/ Gas works Park/ University Village. I can\\'t think of a better spot for base camp in a Seattle visit! Martin and Loren were wonderful hosts. They gave me very useful information about vegetarian restaurants; recommendation where to go nearby in this interesting part of Seattle. The house was clean and very well kept and the neighborhood was nice. I had a great stay- Martin & Lauren were awesome hosts. The room was just as I expected, super cozy, and it\\'s right near gorgeous downtown Ballard and public transportation.  We had a nice two-night stay at Martin and Laura\\'s place. The room is perfect if you are exploring the neighbourhood and Seattle. Ballard is really nice, has a lot of good restaurants and good bus connections to Downtown Seattle.  I had a great stay while at a dance festival in Ballard.  While I didn\\'t get to see much of my hosts, they were very accommodating and the room was very comfortable.  Thanks so much! Martin and Lauren were great hosts and made us feel welcome, both in town and in their home, including having use of the kitchen.  The queen size bed is a futon, and we found it comfortable.  The room feels private and is located only one block from Market Street in Ballard, making walking to shopping, dining and music a breeze.  A first great experience with an Air BNB listing.  Martin was welcoming in spite of a flight delay. The room was exactly as described. The house is in a quiet location and spotless. The location is perfect for finding interesting shops, and nice walks along the water. Martin was always available to answer questions. I would certainly stay there again. Martin and Lauren were both very friendly and accommodating. The room and bathroom were very clean. The suite itself is spread in a way that makes the space feel private and we never felt like we were intruding on their space - or them in ours. The neighbourhood is quite lovely, and close to everything. The only tricky part was finding it at first as Google maps tells you to turn onto a road that looks more like an alley or a driveway... but other than that, very easy to get to.  Our hosts were wonderful and the experience was wonderful Great spot near downtown Ballard, super quiet and Lauren and Martin were gracious hosts Martin was great, very accomodating. The unit was quiet and private, perfect for my visit. Martin and Lauren were great hosts! Their rental space is very private and was a perfect location in Ballard to enjoy the neighborhood fully. My girlfriend and I felt very comfortable and appreciated the patio and ability to come and go as we pleased. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you! Martin and Lauren were very welcoming and helpful The room was exactly as described and exactly what I needed.  Really just two blocks from all of the retail and restaurants of downtown Ballard.  I didn\\'t spend much time there as I was in an all day intensive training with very long hours, but it was a clean, comfortable, affordable and close alternative to an expensive hotel.  The hosts were very nice, easy to correspond with before my stay, and let me drop off my things a bit early.  If you need to stay right in Ballard, this is the place.     Perfect location and setup. Thanks Everything with our stay was great!  A nice room with a clean bathroom in a central location. Martin was very friendly and accommodating. It was great staying with Martin and Lauren. Nothing can beat the location; if you\\'re from out of town, the bars and restaurants in Downtown Ballard are fantastic and it\\'s so convenient to be able to walk there. The room was small but still had enough space, and you had access to your own bathroom. The room you stay in is on the ground floor, and the rest of  the family is on the two above floors, so it feels very private! They have cats if you\\'re allergic, and also a 2 year old who was a little noisy at times but never woke us up. \\nOverall a great experience! Would definitely want to stay there again.  Martin and Lauren are super nice. They went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. Their house is in a great neighborhood with a ton of stuff to do. Lauren & Martin are great hosts! The room has a super comfy bed, a really nice view and two adorable cats. We stayed for a couple of the days and had no problems getting in or out of the house as we pleased.  I would definitely stay at this location again.  I had a nice stay while I was in town for work. I enjoyed being just a block from the main Ballard strip and I found the room and bathroom comfortable and convenient. Martin was helpful when I arrived and answered all my questions. I\\'d be happy to stay there again. Lovely place to stay- close to tons of fun stuff in the Ballard neighborhood! The Locks, the farmers market on Sunday and restaurants and bars galore. Bed and bath were private and it was a cozy little place to get some rest between my Seattle adventures. Was greeted by an adorable cat when I got there. Thanks Lauren and Martin! We had a lovely stay with Martin & Lauren. Their house is very well located in Old Ballard and the room is very comfortable and private. We didn\\'t spend any time in the house besides in our room because we were out exploring for our one day in Seattle, but it\\'s definitely recommended if you need a comfortable, affordable place to sleep. Great communication and a great location. Was exactly what I needed and the host was very polite. Overall it was a good stay and worry free.  Our stay here was very convenient and comfortable. Walking distance from the various shops and restaurants in Ballard. The room was simple, no frills... just what we needed. Being on the first floor of the complex made it seem private and unobtrusive. Having the private bathroom was key with me being 6 months pregnant! I would recommend their place to those who don\\'t sleep in late, their toddler was a little noisy in the morning but that didn\\'t bother us.. We\\'re both early risers.  We didn\\'t have any problems with noise late at night. Also, check in and check out was really easy... Didn\\'t have the opportunity to meet Martin in person but did briefly meet Lauren who was super welcoming! Thank you! It was a nice location and a place, nearby stores and restaurants.  Martin and his wife were very nice hosts. We enjoyed the time at their place. We had an own entrance so that it was private. Martin and Lauren were very nice and  helpful. Thank you for letting us staying at your place.  Great location and good communication!  Thanks Lauren and Martin! Martin and Lauren were super nice! They did their best to help us out with everything and were extremely welcoming to their home.\\r\\nThe room itself was comfortable, though a bit small (we traveled with a baby) , and unfortunatly not very clean. the porch is a big plus. The location is wonderful! My friend and I had a fantastic stay here! Our hosts were both super helpful with tips and suggestions as well as very respectful of our privacy. We especially appreciated how accommodating they were for our schedule in terms of check in and check out times. The bed was plenty comfortable for two people and the room and bathroom were both neat and clean. We loved that the listing was only a few minutes\\' walk away from downtown Ballard and easily accessible to a number of bus routes. We loved the neighborhood and would definitely stay here again if we were to return for a second visit! I loved the neighbourhood : Ballard is packed with nice pubs and restaurants. Martin\\'s house was located close to a bus stop that took us downtown in about 30 minutes. It was great to have our own private bathroom. It was a great stay at Martins house, he and his family are very helpful, nice and communicative. We enjoyed our stay with them very much, as the location is great and by bus you are within 25 min downtown Seattle ;-) highly recommended place to stay at. ;-)) Really great location in Ballard. Close to public transportation downtown (15 min bus). Super nice hosts and very clean! Would stay again.  Such nice hosts, a perfect location, and very comfortable and clean. I highly recommend.  Great place with wonderful hosts.  Martin and Lauren were great! Their place was nice. I loved the back porch being connected to the room. It was perfect for writing and reading. Their place was right near the botanical gardens and Chittenden Locks in Ballard. If you stay here, get an Orca card - the buses and trains will be your friends. I definitely would stay here again. Ballard is a cool neighborhood! Our hosts were great, the room was comfy, everything was good :)  Had a great time in Ballard! Great location to check out this amazing neighborhood, easy to hop a bus downtown, too, about 30-40 minutes.\\n\\nRoom was nice and clean, a little small but plenty for two people to comfortably stay several days. Had a nice outdoor area, and is on a separate floor from the rest of the home so plenty of privacy.\\n\\nThanks! Gracious and friendly hosts. Great place to stay for a few days while in Seattle! Ballard is a little outside the downtown hub, but there is a direct bus line 2 blocks from the house. Very nice hosts, helpful and there to answer any questions!  Lauren has been very friendly, the room was clean and good for 2 people. They told us they were out of town when we were arriving but the cats gave us the welcome. They live in a nice neighborhood with good connection to the city center (30-40 mins by bus) This room suited my needs in Seattle and I was made to feel welcome by Martin and Lauren. Their toddler was shy but adorable and there was no problem with any noise. The room is basic, small, has a futon, an adjacent bathroom and a walkout to a patio which helps it feel more spacious. It\\'s straight through from the entrance door and is the only living space at ground level so very private. I liked that it had lots of shelving and room for storage in the closet. I was welcome to use their kitchen for fridge storage and microwaving my breakfast oatmeal. Not quite like the photos since it\\'s in full use as a family space.  The photos represented my room well (as long as you are aware of what wide angle lenses do) but I found the bathroom shower in need of a good grout scrub in areas  if it was to look all shiny and white as shown in the photos. The location was good too, being in an interesting neighbourhood called Ballard. There was a supermarket and bus stop for the downtown bus two blocks away. The took 35 minutes to deposit you near Pikes market and all the sights of downtown Seattle. And as a visiting senior the ride only cost a dollar! On balance this was a great place for my visit to Seattle.  The hosts were friendly and helpful, and their room met my needs. It\\'s a pretty simple bedroom+bathroom setup with a good deal of privacy, and worked great as my place to crash between all the activities of a wedding weekend.  Great location, right next to public transportation, awesome location in Ballard. This place is ideal for experiencing the best of Seattle, beautiful area.  You couldn\\'t ask for a better location.  I have no regrets from this stay, clean, quiet, comfy and everything you need is walking distance.  Martin & Lauren are nice people and I am grateful they shared their home with my cousin and I. Martin & Lauren are great! They are incredibly gracious and flexible hosts. The place is just as described and the neighborhood is amazing. It\\'s a great place to stay if you\\'re looking to explore Seattle. They are right in the middle of the action! We had a very late flight and Lauren and Martin were life savers and let us keep our bags there later than check out.  Great hosts; nice, charming neighborhood; private room & bathroom. Would definitely return and recommend.  Lauren and Martin were excellent hosts. The room was as shown, and it was perfect for our stay in Ballard. The location was very good as well! I was very happy with my experience staying with Martin and Lauren who were very friendly and welcoming. This was an absolutely perfect location for me!! It was near my dance venue and in a charming neighborhood with fantastic restaurant, coffee, grocery shopping and other shopping opportunities. Easy arrangements coming and going from the lower level of their house, with lots of privacy because I was on my own level. The bedroom was smallish (just like the pictures), but I was there alone and it was perfectly adequate; ditto the bathroom. I thought the bed was very cozy and comfy.  I will absolutely try to come back again the next time I do a dance weekend in Ballard. Great experience with very nice hosts. I would 100% recommend it. They layout is perfect for guests and having a private bathroom was great! \\r\\n\\r\\n My partner and had a great time. We were only there for a short bit, but they were nothing but attentive and welcoming. It\\'s a cute room with a spotless bathroom. We\\'d definitely stay there again.  I have the opportunity to stay with Martin and Lauren. I had an excellent experience. The place was as described. I had total privacy; the room is a few steps from the main entrance with a bathroom next to it. I was given a code for the entrance door and we had some friendly interaction at times. The place was clean and near all buss lines and Ballard´s downtown. The bed was comfortable and warm. I would definitively stay with them again when I go back to Ballard. Martin and Lauren\\'s accommodation was very good - the location is great, they communicated very well with us and it was easy to find the room and the guest bathroom.  I liked that they were downstairs so we did not feel too intrusive.  We didn\\'t spend any time with the hosts, but from our brief encounter they were friendly and I can recommend this listing as a convenient and straight-forward place to stay in Ballard. Lisa was an excellent host, very concerned about my comfort. The room was clean and cozy and had a nice patio. Close walk to lots of restaurants. I would stay here again! Lisa was a great host.  She was very communicative and her place is as described (cozy and private).   Thank you! My weekend stay in this Ballard location for my granddaughter\\'s birthday celebration at Webster Park was just what I needed.  The location was very close to dowtown Ballard and the Chittenden Locks. Restaurants, coffee shops, and QFC are all close by.  The neighborhood was relatively quiet. On street parking (close by) was the only\\r\\ndraw back.  My host indicated that she could make an arrangement for parking.\\r\\n Lisa was a very kind and accommodating host. Her place is very neat and cozy! Your stay will be very comfortable and Lisa will be there to help make your stay an exceptional one!  Excellent place to stay. Cannot recommend it enough. Cozy, private, accessible, attentive host. She thinks of everything you\\'d need to know. A very organized, caring person.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is excellent. Even though I had to rent a car, I was able to walk everywhere that I wanted to go. All the great things are within walking distance.\\r\\nShe is a really positive person and her dogs are very sweet. The neighborhood as a whole is a very lovely place to be. I had an amazing stay with Lisa! The room was perfect and very comfortable. There was lots to do just walking distance from the house. I definitely recommend staying with Lisa!  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Lisa\\'s. She was quick to respond, helped me out, and checking in/getting set up was simple and easy. Lisa was working most of the time I was there, but I got to talk with her a couple of times, and she\\'s a lot of fun. If you\\'re looking for a relaxing and quality place to stay in Ballard with easy access to all the great things Ballard has, and without breaking the bank, stay here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room is just as pictured and described. It\\'s a small cozy room that\\'s got just about everything you need. It is a smaller room with a small bed (and very comfortable); so, if you\\'re a couple that expects to spend a lot of time in the room, it\\'d be tight. I found the room (and bed) very comfortable and appreciated the fridge, Keurig coffee machine, and other little things like that. The well-done bathroom is right outside the bedroom door, and there\\'s closet space to keep your suitcases/stuff if you want. It all works well, and Lisa keeps it clean, which is always appreciated. Some hosts don\\'t really clean much or seemingly at all, which is always odd, and a turn off. You can tell Lisa enjoys this and takes pride in doing it well.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if when you\\'re at the house/room, you can open the sliding glass door right onto a little covered patio in the fenced-in garden area. It\\'s great to just sit out there and have a coffee, read, etc. Very private, and then you can walk right out and be in the heart of Ballard in a couple of minutes with shops, restaurants, bars/breweries or walk 5+ minutes down to the Chittenden locks. I\\'d never been--great place to check out, and the salmon ladder may not sound that cool, but it is. And if you want to get in the car, there are a ton of things close by.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would absolutely come back.\\r\\n\\r\\n Lisa was a great host. She has thought of everything. There was a coffee maker, plates, cups microwave, refrigerator, comfy bed and lots of pillows. She is in a great location with plenty of shops and restaurants in walking distance. The space was very private on it\\'s own floor. I would definitely recommend her place. My son and I enjoyed those 4 days stay with Lisa, this is our first visit to Seattle and those information Lisa provided to us are really helpful during our stay. Very close to Ray\\'s Boat house and Heram Locks which we plan to visit before we left for Seattle! This is a surprise to us within few minutes walk from Lisa\\'s House. Thanks for the kindly hosting! We have a very good summer vacation in Seattle! (By the way, during our visit to Safeco Field, my son got autograph of his favorite Pitcher in the Baltimore Orioles, Chen, who came from Taiwan !) This is a great spot to discover the neighborhood of Ballard. Just a few min walk to restaurants, bars and night life. \\n\\nLisa was very kind and willing to give information or answer any questions we had. The space is very small so I would recommend the spot for one, or a couple who doesn\\'t mind being on top of each other. \\n\\nThe outdoor space is very nice though and provides a good place to relax and enjoy the quietness in the shade.\\n\\nAll around a nice spot.\\n\\n Lisa was great and the room was described perfectly. It would be cozy for 2 but was perfect for me. The location is awesome and the parking is ok but can be a bit tight at times. She does offer a designated spot for a bit extra but I was ok on the street. Seattle was great thanks in part to this wonderful little room. Thanks! Lisa was a great host and the area around her home is amazing. Tons of shops/bars/coffee within a 1/2 mile. The small, peaceful courtyard is a great place to enjoy a morning cup of the coffee that Lisa provides for the room. Definitely recommend. Lisa was a wonderful hostess, providing helpful tips about the neighborhood but also offering great privacy. The room was as described and beautifully done. While small, it is amazing that she could fit in a coffee maker, small fridge and other amenities to make it more convenient without making it crowded. The door to the small backyard is in the bedroom but offers no access to the street. The Ballard neighborhood is a fun place and the room is extremely convenient to restaurants and other activities. We spent a lovely Sunday morning at the Ballard farmer\\'s market, about which Lisa luckily had sent me a text. I would definitely stay here again if I was in Seattle by myself. Lisa\\'s place is a cozy little oasis in Seattle. The room has a single bed, a nice chair and table, a coffee pot with tea and coffee, a small fridge and hallway bath room next door. Everything is clean and tastefully decorated best of all is it has a sliding glass door that opens to a quaint flower garden just outside. So pleasant to sit there with my coffee and enjoy the flowers. It is also only a few blocks walk to some pubs, shops, and restaurants. Lisa is happy to show you the way.  Very nice first experience with airb&b. Lisa was an attentive host. Very convenient location in the charming Seattle neighborhood of Ballard. A bit cramped for 2 adults (nice single bed  plus camp cot) but having outdoor access to a little private garden was a treat. Lisa is the best  hostess in Seattle! Because of my poor English, I couldn\\'t express what I thought smoothly. Thank you for everything! I hope to see you again someday! The room is great and Lisa was very accommodating. She has the room stocked with everything you would need- refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker with coffee pods, bottled water. The outdoor patio is a perfect place to chill out. The location is very conveniently located to shops, restaurants and pubs in Ballard and bus routes to downtown Seattle. Thanks Lisa. Lisa met me when I arrived to her home and oriented me to the room.  The room was cozy and comfortable.  The room is in a great location in Ballard making it a nice \"base camp\" for excursions to the Locks and the marina.  I enjoyed my time in Ballard and look forward to returning.  Thanks for everything, Lisa. Lisa was very welcoming. Her place was private, clean and quiet. I was really impressed with her hospitality. The room had all the amenities I needed to be comfortable for the week. Thank you, Lisa for a wonderful stay! The room was as described, small but beautifully adequate. The bed was comfortable with nice linens and pillows. I appreciated the private bathroom, mini fridge, and cabinet of basic kitchen items (for snacks, not meal prep) and little garden space outside. I loved the area! Lisa was also kind enough to drive me to my meeting place the morning of my departure so that I didn\\'t need to walk there with my luggage - she also picked up a colleague near by to help her out. Her two little dogs once they spent a few moments with me had only small greetings and farewells from her upstairs space upon my coming and going. Will surely stay there again when back in town. Thanks, Lisa! Lisa was out of town when I stayed at her place, but she still managed to be an absolutely amazing host from afar. Before I came, she emailed with me to explain how the public transport system worked, how best to come from the airport and answered any other questions I had. The place was perfect -- pretty much exactly as the listing explained. You can tell she has thought of every little detail, it has just what you need (little fan for at night, dishes if you want to eat food, a nice fridge, comfy pillow!). I fell in love with the neighborhood Ballard, such a cute little enclave of Seattle that is about a 25 minute bus ride from downtown (which is super easy to take!). It is an easy 5 minute walk from her place to the main Ballard drag (Market Street and Ballard) and the same distance from a beautiful park (the Locks). So it\\'s a great location. She does have dogs that bark when you first enter the apartment (they stay upstairs the whole time), but they quiet down soon after you arrive so it\\'s not a problem at all. It\\'s a very quiet place to sleep as well.  Neighbourhood was great, a lot of places to eat out and a bus stop 2 min away that can get you to downtown in about 25min. The room was small but had everything you would need, coffee maker, fridge, bags...The little patio in the garden is perfect for relaxing after a long day. It was a great experience and peaceful stay at Lisa\\'s house, if I ever come back to Seattle, surely will repeat there! This was the perfect Air BnB experience: you feel like you have the entire place to yourself while super friendly and fun Lisa is right upstairs living her fabulous life w her two well-behaved and frisky chihuahuas. I think this home is exactly what Air BnB had in mind when they created this business model. I felt catered to like I was in a \\'real\\' BnB but independent enough like I was in a hotel yet cozy enough that I felt I was staying in a friend\\'s really cushy guest quarters... Lisa\\'s home is also, to boot, in the perfect quiet location right off the main streets of Historic Ballard. What a perfect neighborhood to stay in to get how well people can live in Seattle... This place was great! Such easy access to the Ballard Locks and just a very quick walk to great bars and restaurants. The set up of the house was great as I could come and go without disturbing Lisa. The fridge and coffee maker were a nice addition for anyone staying longer.  I had a great time. The room had everything I needed while being away from home. Lisa is a great host, through and through. The location is unbelievably close to best parts of Ballard. Lisa was the perfect combination: helpful without being intrusive.  I felt very well taken care of, and I highly recommend her as a host. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was small but the space was used very efficiently and was stocked with almost everything a guest might need. And it was wonderful having access to a private bathroom.  The private garden is the perfect place to have your morning coffee. And part of the space is covered, so you can use it even in the rain.  Miss understanding where to smoke. Call me after 10:00pm and complaint about my son smoking. Threaten to have my son leave the premises, and would not refund the money.  I really enjoyed my stay at Lisa\\'s Cozy Room and Bath. Lisa was a gracious hostess and quick to reply to my emails and questions about the room and neighborhood. Her directions to get into the house were timely and clear. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location was great. It was an easy walk to coffee shops and a grocery store with nice deli. The neighborhood felt safe day and night. Parking on the street was tight. It helps to know how to parallel park. But the street itself was quiet, especially at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room and bath were super clean and neat. The big window and sliding glass door brought in light and fresh air. Plus, they both looked out into the enclosed patio so it felt very private. There was a microwave and small fridge, and Lisa provided tea and coffee for the Keurig as well as paper plates and utensils. I found the bed very comfortable. \\r\\n\\r\\nLisa\\'s BnB exceeded my expectations. I\\'d be happy to stay here again and would recommend this location to anyone looking for a cozy place to stay in Seattle. Lisa is welcoming and her listing is accurate.  The room is cozy, comfortably decorated, and well supplied with a coffee/tea maker, refrigerator, and microwave. The neighborhood is safe, close to two amazing breakfast spots, a grocery store and fun shops. First time using airbnb, perfect experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nHonestly couldn\\'t have asked for a better time. The place was quiet, clean, safe and comfortable. You\\'ll need to take a bus to get downtown but there is a nice neighborhood just a few blocks away for shops and restaurants. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Lisa\\'s guestroom was perfect for what I needed for my brief stay. She was gone for the weekend, but everything was set up before I arrived. The room is as pictured; small but perfect for one person and supplied with thoughtful amenities including a small fridge and microwave.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I liked most about the guestroom was the privacy on the first floor entrance which allowed me to come and go without disturbing Lisa\\'s friend who was watching her dogs. The bed was very comfortable and the private bathroom was a must have for me. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe parking space was too small and the access too tight for my Audi Allroad and is best suited for a compact car. However, parking on the adjacent street worked well and her location is in easy walking distance to a QFC 24/7 market and a great mix of restaurants.  The small covered patio looked like a nice place to relax and enjoy the fresh air when the weather is warm and sunny. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, Lisa\\'s guest room  is small but very comfortable and clean, great amenities and fast Wi-Fi, thoughtfully decorated with an artistic flair, very convenient with it\\'s privacy and wonderful, easy walking distance to central Ballard. And it is a great value too! Lisa made us feel welcome. The check in was easy. The room was comfortable and warm. It is a great area of Ballard to walk around and explore. She is a great host.  This was my first airbnb experience and it was fantastic. Lisa was super nice, communicative, and accommodating. The room itself was cozy and clean and very comfortable. There were some goodies in there like a keurig coffee maker and some tasty snacks which was a nice surprise. The backyard was a charming and cool place to hang out and accessible from the room via sliding door. The neighborhood was nice and quiet. It was only a short walk to the Ballard locks and an assortment of shops and restaurants and breweries. Overall I felt very welcome here and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Ballard. This location is as close to central Ballard as you could want, with a great supermarket only 2 blocks away. The room is cozy as Lisa advertised; a small space filled with light and greatly enhanced by the covered patio right out the glass sliding door. I rented in the heart of winter-- cold and rainy being Seattle, but I know the patio would become a fantastic \"other room\" in most months.  Lisa was a welcome and gracious host, and was able to quickly reply to any question I had, even when she was at work. Lisa provided everything you needed for the room, making you feel very welcome in her home. Bathroom right next door, with something I appreciate-- a great shower! Lisa was a great host and made our first Airbnb experience a great one. She gave us a lot of privacy when needed and provided anything we needed right away (new dishes, filtered water). The room was very cozy and clean. It was nice to have a private bathroom and have the whole floor to ourselves. The room was too nice we felt like we could live there. The neighbourhood was walkable and had a lot of nice little stores, restaurants and cafes. We would stay here again if we visited Seattle again. Lisa was an amazing host, and really made me feel comfortable in her home.  She is also super helpful about any questions regarding the area!  Some of my favorite things about staying with Lisa were the location, fresh fruit and comfortable room. Lisa is very warm and welcoming. The room is just as pictured, perfect for one, with lots of amenities. The bathroom is lovely, and everything worked great.  Well I didn\\'t use the tv, coffee maker, or microwave. It is just 2 blocks from good food, groceries, the water.  Great Location. The bed was very comfortable, room heater was great.  Super comfy bed! I liked that I could keep my room cool by turning down the heat. Lisa was very accommodating and communicative. \\r\\nThis is a perfect set up for a single person and Lisa has really set things up to make you comfortable.  Lisa was a fantastic host, even if I didn\\'t get to meet her! Her place is as advertised and provided plenty of privacy and a great location. I would definitely stay here again! \\r\\nLisa\\'s room with a garden view was just perfect. The decor was charming.  She provided every possible amenity and total privacy. The location was so convenient to all the restaurants and quirky shops of Ballard. Lisa was very friendly and accommodating. The room is small but very comfortable--great bed--and the bathroom is really nice. The best part is the little patio you have all to yourself. You\\'re in a very walkable location--to the Locks, restaurants, the farmer\\'s market, etc. Street parking is a little difficult at night as it is a popular area. Lisa\\'s communication was great from start to finish. Everything felt clean and fresh - fruit, coffee provided which was a sweet touch. The room is very private which was perfect for me - on it\\'s own floor with private bathroom and patio.  The room itself is pretty small, but totally comfortable for one, especially with the other amenities. I loved sitting out on the patio in the mornings. The Ballard neighborhood is super great! Easy walking to lots of cool restaurants and shops - feels safe. I would stay again! thanks, Lisa. This place is cozy but perfect for one.  The neighborhood is great, the home is safe and welcoming.  I stayed two very comfortable nights and would be happy to stay here again. This was my second stay at Lisa\\'s house! Again: everything\\'s fine... as I already mentioned in my first rating: I highly recommend staying here. Lisa\\'s a great host! I spent a great time in Lisa\\'s cosy room! Everything was perfect... I arrived very late and found the room and bath so very well prepared for me: fresh water, fruits, coffee, milk... Lisa made me feel at home and comfortable! Lisa\\'s house is located close to Ballard (walking distance) and there\\'s a great coffee shop just around the corner. I highly recommend Lisa as a host and will surely come back!  Lisa was a kind and welcoming host. The room/bathroom was clean and as described with great location just a skip away to the Locks and Ballard Way. I appreciated the refrigerator, apples, steel cut oats, filtered water and coffee in the room. Our stay at Lisa\\'s place was great! It\\'s a small room, but it\\'s set up well with all the amenities we needed. The location is not right in downtown, but it is really close to the shops and restaurants in Ballard (which were really cool). Absolutely would recommend :) I couldn\\'t have asked for a better host! This was my first time using Airbnb, and Lisa made the whole experience a piece of cake from beginning to end. I was in town for a week of exams and needed a quiet and comfortable place to settle in - cozy it was! Modern renovations, funky/eclectic decor with a charming back porch and garden area. Down to every last detail, my entire experience was A++. Lisa provided the perfect mix of hospitality and privacy. I was pleasantly surprised by her inclusion of organic fruits, oatmeal, and selection of coffee & teas. Perfect for a quick breakfast before running out the door! The room was also equipped with a mini-fridge, coffee maker, microwave, hot pot, filtered water, plates and utensils. Ballard itself is a delightful location, and her proximity couldn\\'t be beat. Right next to everything. Grocery store, bars, restaurants, cafes. Even the main bus line into the city was only a couple blocks away. The next time I make it back to Seattle, this is the place! Thanks for everything Lisa!!!!!!!! =] Lisa is a very caring and generous host.  She gladly opened her home to my friend who needed a comfortable & quiet place for a week.  Thanks for your hospitality!  :) Everything that was written on the listing was accurate.  Lisa made me feel very welcome.  From the fruits that were waiting for me to the shampoos to the private garden.  It was a wonderful stay.  I would definitely recommend staying here.\\r\\nThe neighborhood seemed nice.  I didn\\'t spend to much time walking around but restaurants and coffee shops were only a 5 min walk away. The room is cozy, perfect for one. It is  whimsically and thoughtfully furnished, from the extra blankets and pillows to the coffeemaker,  and the mini-frig, and the welcome bowl of fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is safe. The location is a few minutes walk from bakeries, restaurants and shops on Ballard\\'s main street. \\r\\n\\r\\nLisa has a folder with instructions for the appliances, and guides to the area. She covers all bases by providing oatmeal for breakfast, filtered water, fresh milk in the mini frig, and even plates and silverware.  Arrangements for arrival and access were perfect, I just let my self in and made myself at home. Met the host Lisa a little later who talked me through everything, coffee, the fruit she had left for me, access to the garden (which was lovely), the bathroom, where to go. She made me feel super welcome, but then pretty much left me to enjoy my stay and come and go as i pleased - perfect. Great room, great host, great neighbourhood, if you are going to Seattle, stay here! Lisa was very helpful and thought of everything. The room was comfortable and opened up to a beautiful garden. The location was great, just a couple minutes from everything in Ballard. I\\'ll definitely look to stay here again on future trips to Seattle. Amazing place! Amazing value! Very beautiful room surrounded by greenery. When I came I was greeted by blueberries, apples, and a wonderful coffee maker with coffee, cream, and sugar. She is a very kind and thoughtful host, who has carefully attended to every detail. Lisa was a generous host.  She provided us with cold water and fresh fruit upon our arrival.  Our room was quiet, clean and had direct access a patio/garden area.  Ballard is a great neighborhood with many excellent places to eat/drink only a few minutes away when walking. Lisa\\'s home was just as advertised. Nice comfy bed, room with TV etc. the fruit and coffee/oatmeal was a nice touch. The room is perfect for anyone wanting a low-key, convenient, well-located place to say, especially if you\\'re traveling alone.  Lisa does a great job making you feel welcome!  Overall a great value! Lisa has created a special, wonderfully warm, comfortable space. The room, the patio, the garden, the private bathroom will make any guest comfortable. I stayed for 10 days and each day was a vacation. She has thought of everything. I will definitely stay again on my next Seattle trip. Thank you Lisa Lisa was an excellent host, her location and accommodations we perfect. Next time in Seattle this will be the first place I hope to stay. Lisa place was amazing. It felt very private. Basically the whole downstairs is yours plus the garden is unoccupied. We stayed 2 people and did not feel cramped. I live in Seattle and I will make this gem a personal getaway in the future. Highly recommend. Thanks Lisa!  This is the second time I\\'ve stayed at Lisa\\'s place. I really like Lisa\\'s attention to detail. Everything I could possibly need is there. It is nice being just a few minutes from Ballard so I can catch buses or grab dinner. This was the ideal room for me. It had everything I needed to jump start my Seattle vacation, and everything was waiting when I arrived. The house is situated in a very walkable neighborhood and it was very easy to get around the area. Thanks Lisa! Lisa was just as hospitable, welcoming, and accommodating as all her reviews describe her. Her home is close enough to everything Ballard has to offer without being so close you encounter the crowd (or hear them).  This is a small but cozy and lovely place to stay.  We have booked this property more than once and are very happy with it. The location in Ballard is excellent.  Lisa is a great host with great communication.  Lisa\\'s place was great and exactly as described. The absolute best part about her place is the location. The Neighborhood of Ballard is an exceptional place to be. Cafe\\'s, restaurants, and a place to grab a drink are all a short walk away (there\\'s even some live music venues).I would recommend Lisa\\'s place to anyone visiting Seattle!  Lisa\\'s place was perfect for my stay in Ballard. It\\'s in a great, convenient location and very comfortable. Lisa takes good care of you, and I would definitely stay there again. Lisa\\'s place was clean, comfortable, quiet, and in a perfect location! Lisa made us feel VERY welcome and we loved all the extra amenities that came with the place (coffee, oatmeal, orange juice, etc). We plan on staying here again! Everything about Lisa\\'s place was perfect. It was extremely clean, exactly like the listing, she left fruit for me and had water and coffee, plenty of extra blankets, a great bathroom and a keypad to enter the room so I could come and go as I pleased - whenever. She was also lovely in person and so accommodating and quick and clear in communication. I felt comfortable and slept like I was at home. Ballard is the best neighborhood in Seattle (I am from NYC!) and this place is literally steps from so many awesome places. It was just me staying there, and I could not have asked for a better situation. I will stay here whenever in Seattle!  I had a very comfortable stay at Lisa\\'s apartment.  Communication was excellent and her place was easy to find.  Well located in Ballard close some outstanding restaurants.  The apartment is not large but had everything I needed.  \\r\\nThank you Lisa! Lisa was a fine host. I had a very rocky start coming in late; I was unable to find her location.  Parking in Ballard is VERY challenging; kindly she offered me a space behind her place which made coming and going much easier. The suite of rooms was small but well appointed.  Lisa was helpful and friendly.  My friend & I stayed here for a long weekend to celebrate a wedding in Seattle. Lisa was very easy to communicate with before check in & checked on us the day we arrived. In the room she provided fruit, cold water, & teas- nice touch :-) The room was clean & had a small fridge. It was a little on the small side for 2 people (even a couple because the bed only fits one). Lisa did bring a cot in that we used at night & folded up during the day.\\nIf you are a light sleeper I recommend bringing ear plugs as the host gets up early for work & the pups do occasionally bark.\\nOverall we had a very pleasant stay & walked or took bus/Uber everywhere. Nice neighborhood.\\n Unfortunately we didn\\'t get to meet Lisa but Dyana was very helpful. The room was great. The mini fridge was ideal for the short stay. Central Ballard location. Overall a great experience. I would stay here again in a minute! Lisa\\'s place is an absolutely perfect place to stay! You can walk to coffee shops, breakfast, and the very beautiful Ballard Locks! Her nice room is set up so well and the outside garden space is so wonderful to sit in. I can\\'t recommend this high enough. Lisa was accommodating as I spent time decompressing from my daughter\\'s difficult child birth. Privacy\\' quiet and comfort were what I needed and I also enjoyed the patio garden. One of the perks was being a block off Market for coffee and sandwich runs, close to QFC for groceries for the new family and the Aveda store for a few impromptu gifts. I enjoyed my stay and recommend Lisa\\'s retreat, especially for single travelers. \\r\\n Lisa was a wonderful host.  She was very accommodating to our family and our needs as my mom visited her granddaughter.\\r\\nThe room had everything you need for a cozy stay. This is the 3rd or 4th time staying at Lisa\\'s place. I always enjoy my stay. Staying at Lisa\\'s place was great! She\\'s super accommodating, nice, and was fun to talk with. The location was great too- fresh fruit, mini fridge, filtered water, OJ, and keurig machine! Thanks Lisa! I rented this room for my sister while she was visiting from out of town. I just saw it briefly, but it looked very clean and comfortable, with many nice touches and amenities. My sister said she had a great stay and really appreciated the fresh fruit and orange juice that Lisa provided. I will definitely recommend this location to friends and family in the future! Fantastic location, and a lovely spot.  Lisa was a gracious host and truly cared about my stay.  I would not hesitate to stay there again and I am sure that you\\'ll enjoy your stay.\\r\\n Lisa was very welcoming.  She provided a coffee pot, microwave and fridge even.  Orange juice, fresh fruit, coffee, instant oatmeal, dishes etc.  All was included.  I got in late and left early both mornings I was there, so appreciated breakfast in the room.  \\r\\nThe room in small as she states, but if the weather was nice, one could open the sliding glass door to a nice covered patio seating area.\\r\\nLisa printed out directions for me to take the bus and light rail to the airport for an early departure.\\r\\nOne could walk to the Fish Locks and downtown Ballard from here. Cozy room in an excellent location. Lisa exceeded expectations and went out of her way to accommodate us. Lisa was an excellent host, and went out of her way to accomodate us. The room was separated from the rest of the house so you could come and go without trodding through the rest of her living area. \\r\\nThere was an issue with the toilet when we were there, which she promptly fixed and even gave us a partial refund which was not necessary. When we were there she also had some light breakfast items on the desk and drinks in the mini fridge. Would definitely stay with her again, highly recommended.  Even though Lisa was out of town, everything about my arrival was well taken care of....and it was Thanksgiving! The location is great, although parking can be a bit of a challenge.\\r\\nLisa has created a lovely, whimsical space for guests. It is very clean and well thought out. Snacks, fruit, coffee, orange juice in the fridge....and cute little chalkboard notes around to help you find anything you need!\\r\\nWe had an issue with the heat, and Lisa went well above what would be expected to make things right. I always love staying at Lisa\\'s place. It is super comfortable and close to Ballard and Lisa always thinks of everything and is a very generous host. Lisa\\'s place was very comfortable, and she\\'s thought of all the amenities that you might want!  The location was perfect for exploring the Ballard area, easy walking to the locks, to the Nordic Heritage Museum, and to all cafes and restaurants.  The patio would be great in better weather (i.e. Not December). Lisa was an absolute sweetheart, checking in with me regularly to make sure I had everything I needed. \\n\\nHer place is cozy and bright. Everything was clean and well thought out. Lisa has clear instructions and notes everywhere to really make you feel at home. Little touches like a pitcher of filtered water in the fridge and extra blankets in a basket near the bed really made it a nice experience. \\n\\nThe house is centrally located, and I was able to walk to tons of great restaurants, coffee shops, and shopping on Ballard Ave. \\n\\nI would highly recommend this spot for a visit to the lovely city of Seattle.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Patti & Benson\\'s place. The location could not be better...close enough for an easy walk to the restaurants and shops on Market and Ballard, but far enough away to enjoy the peace and quiet of a nice residential neighborhood. The property itself is terrific. Although Patti works from here, you pretty much have the run of the place. There is a functioning kitchen, should you decide not to avail yourself of the many great places nearby to eat. (There is a very good grocery store just a few blocks away.) The bedroom is quite comfortable, with lots of closet space. Free Wi-Fi is provided. There is ample space to move around, and a nice outside area, when the weather cooperates. Be aware that there is no TV, so if you need outside stimulus, bring a book!. This property is best for adults and older children. Much of Patti’s work is on display and would be irresistible to little ones, and there would be no way  to child-proof the place. There is a very narrow, somewhat steep stairway going to the upstairs, which could prove hazardous to small children. Finally, Patti and Benson are the most thoughtful of hosts and went out of their way to make sure my visit was perfect. And it was. I will most certainly stay with them again when my travels take me to the Seattle area.  An absolutely extraordinary place with extraordinary hosts - it was truly an honor to stay at this gorgeos B&B! The house is located in Ballard, a nice, independent neighborhood north of Seattle Downtown. You will find a cosy, newly renovated bedroom with hand selected interior - so if your sense for design goes beyond IKEA and favours real wooden furniture from earlier times, this is your place! As the house is quite spacious and offers a fully furnished kitchen, you can easily stay here for more than a couple of days.\\r\\nPatti and Benson are very kind and helpful - we couldn´t image better hosts! It was very interesting to learn sth about their art work.\\r\\n\\r\\n Patti and Benson were very helpful, personable hosts.  The space is great - a tastefully decorated heritage house in a quaint neighbourhood with great light.  The hosts were able to accommodate an extra guest in the second bedroom just a week before we arrived.  Ballard is a lovely neighbourhood and the Sunday farmers market is not to be missed.   Wonderful location. The artist\\'s studio is spacious, neat, beautiful and quirky - exactly why we love airbnb. The owners are very thoughtful, pleasant and responsive. We loved the space and Patti\\'s ongoing art projects are delightful to look at. My wife bought a clever little necklace and gets many comments on it. \\r\\n\\r\\nBallard is a great Seattle community, with plenty of restaurants, coffee houses and cool shops, all within easy walking distance of Patti and Benson\\'s place. Highly recommended. This was our first AirBnB experience and we could not have been happier. Patti responded to our inquiry within less than 10 minutes and we confirmed the reservation shortly thereafter. \\r\\nStaying here allowed us to be within 3 blocks from our event in an area that has few other lodging options. After staying in their studio, we would choose to return even if other options were available.\\r\\nThe space was clean and tastefully decorated with Patti\\'s beautiful art pieces. The bedrooms are up a narrow flight of stairs while the bathroom is right at the bottom of the stairs on the main level.\\r\\nPatti uses the space as her art studio yet was very respectful of our privacy.\\r\\nOn Sunday morning, a plate of home baked brownies appeared with a lovely note.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hope to stay at Patti & Benson\\'s studio again soon. \\r\\n Patti and Benson are gracious and helpful hosts. The opportunity to see Patti\\'s art work added to the experience, and she was forthcoming about her work schedule so sharing the kitchen and bathroom was easy. The private bedroom are gleaming bathroom are very comfortable; the whole house is a work of art. You will enjoy this corner of Ballard creativity with Patti and Benson. On very short notice Patti and Benson were able to accommodate us in their beautiful Art studio.  Patti\\'s communication was very prompt and friendly.  We only stayed the night but wish we had stayed longer.  A very spacious, commfortable house with plenty of hidden treasures.  I would highly recommend to stay.... I feel inspired!  Thank you Patti and Benson. Our stay in Ballard was everything we had hoped for. Patti and Benson provide a welcoming, tidy, and inspiring accommodation that is in the heart of such a great neighborhood. I\\'ll never rent a hotel room again! It was a great pleasure meeting them both. I hope to visit again, real soon. Patti is an excellent hostess. Her artist\\'s studio is immaculate and cozy. There is a great amount of detail and beauty to the space that really made my stay enjoyable. Walking distance to Ballard Avenue shops and amenities, the neighborhood is a gem. I would love to return in the future! We had a wonderful (but too short!) visit staying in Patti and Benson\\'s beautiful studio. They were kind and responsive from the first email, and very welcoming to us when we arrived. We can\\'t wait to find another excuse to come to Seattle to stay with them! \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, the place itself is absolutely stunning. Every room is thoughtfully and meticulously decorated in simple, elegant and handmade detail. It is an old house, with broad wooden floors and warm light. The bed is very comfortable -- with both slept like babies. I could go on and on about this location. Truly unique, and perfectly priced. Thank you Patti and Benson for our one-night visit! We\\'d love to stay with you in the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nLucy and Faisal, \\r\\nSan Francisco I booked Patti & Benson\\'s home as a lovely place for my family to stay when they visited us (we live in Ballard) after the birth of our child.  My mother and mother in law both stayed there and it was perfect.  I wanted somewhere nice, comfortable, and safe for them.  Patti was great to work with while making the reservation and during their stay.  She is kind, helpful, and very responsive but not in an intrusive way - the guests always had their privacy and space.  Our family will happily stay here again any time they come to visit us in Ballard.  As a local, I can also attest this this home being very close (a few blocks walk) to everything you\\'d want to see and do in Ballard and an easy location for driving/visiting the rest of Seattle.  I can\\'t thank them enough for making everything so easy and comfortable. Great place, great location. No complaints whatsoever. Would definitely stay again.  Thank you, Patti and Benson, for a wonderful stay in your adorable house! Everything was immaculate. The kitchen had all the things we needed and the beds were comfortable.  \\nI highly recommend staying at this bnb. It is on a quiet neighborhood street, but just a few blocks walk from great restaurants and cages and the Sunday\\'s farmers\\' market.  Patti and Benson were extremely attentive to our needs. Thanks again! Patti & Benson\\'s house is spacious and warm, bright and clean, and filled with the diverse art of Patti\\'s.  The decor and cleanliness makes the atmosphere very calming and serene and relaxing. \\r\\n\\r\\n The location is a quick block or two from the bustle of Ballard, with shops, restaurants, and all else within walking distance.   I found my stay easy, and all the evening and mornings, you have the place entirely to yourself.  Great and easy parking spot around back.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a host, Patti was warm, informative and communicated quickly each time. She was also very accommodating and flexible to some changing needs.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all a great experience.  Patti and Benson were wonderful, flexible hosts, and their studio was cozy and unique. I loved staying among artworks, it was like having our own little museum. The space is comfortable, in a great location and is a beautiful old craftsman house. I\\'d love to stay again! wonderful space, with a very restful atmosphere.  it was lovely to be surrounded by beautiful objects, artwork, amidst the interior setting of this craftsman-style house.  patti & benson were attentive and helpful, and i loved getting to have the chance to meet them.  with everything you need a couple blocks away in the ballard neighborhood, the location couldn\\'t make travelling a more convenient and stress-free experience.  completely fantastic.   This space was so lovely- it was spotlessly clean and cozy, full of neat art and just a few blocks from great restaurants bars and shopping. We found free parking in front of the house, stopped for (excellent) coffee at a shop a block away and had a great afternoon browsing the neat shops in Ballard before hitting a show at one of the many bars down near market street. Great weekend! (And I wouldn\\'t miss trying brunch at the portage bay cafe- it was outrageous!!) Fascinating experience, very high energy spot, super sophisticated hosts that embody the spirit of Seattle.  Very comfortable bed, a great place to reflect for anyone.  -An added thrill was seeing Patti\\'s artwork hanging in a gallery as I was out exploring the nightlife of a very spirited and honest place.   Patti was very prompt in communicating with me.  The space was absolutely lovely, very light and bright.  It was in such close proximity to town, we were able to walk where we needed to go.  She was very warm and easy to work with and the house was fabulous and very clean!  I would highly recommend this space. Delightful, immaculately maintained home with helpful and gracious hosts. Patti and Benson are long-term residents of Seattle\\'s trendy Ballard neighborhood with a wealth of personal experiences with the best places to visit, shop and dine.  Spacious rooms tastefully decorated with unique artistic touches. Cozy garden picnic table. Off-street parking. Great house, lovely neighborhood, and amazing welcoming hosts! We felt so relaxed staying at your place - thank you so much!\\r\\nGenia + Tia I had a wonderful stay at Patti & Benson\\'s darling accommodation.  It was comfortable, neat, clean and in Ballard, a quiet area of Seattle.  Best of all it was just blocks from my daughter\\'s efficiency.  I spent my time with her and so did not get to try out the kitchen which was fully stocked with cooking utensils.  The back garden offered a sweet seating area with possibility for outdoor eating.  While I was staying by myself there was another room available should there have been 2 of me.  Thanks, Patti & Benson, for the comfortable, lovely place to stay.   What a sweet place! Patti was a great host and her space is adorable. Perfect. Charming. I was only sad to have such a short visit. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrankly, I think I\\'ll plan another trip to Seattle just so I can stay here longer! \\r\\n\\r\\nA great neighborhood with lots of cool shops, cafes and restaurants. I loved the pastry and coffee I had at Cafe Bresalu on Sunday morning!\\r\\n\\r\\nHighly recommended.  Perfect stay: comfortable beds, clean, quiet. Good hosts: friendly, helpful, non-obtrusive. Bedrooms upstairs; kitchen, bath and sitting room downstairs, with access to the artist\\'s studio (just to peak at the cool work!) We will definitely be back.  Patti and Benson\\'s studio is the cutest, cleanest most awesome AirBNB place we have been so far. The house is decorated with Patti\\'s art which is awesome, the place has this very good vibe, we slept like babies. \\r\\nThe neighborhood, Ballard, has great stores and restaurants and it is a 20min bus ride from downtown Seattle. It has some great features live Ballard Ave and the Chittenden Locks within walking distance. \\r\\nAnd Patti and Benson are very good hosts and smart Seattlelites with great taste. Thanks Patti, thanks Benson, we will be back! I can\\'t speak highly enough about my stay at Patti\\'s and Benson\\'s place in Ballard. Patti is a gracious host who made my stay a delightful experience. The house is lovely; spacious, exquisitely furnished and decorated and, of course, filled with artworks. Bed and bathroom perfect. Patti gave me excellent guidance on where to go locally to provision myself for my all too brief stay. I spent a lot of time working as I was on my way to a conference. Patti also worked in her studio and it was great to be in a place of art practice. Ballard\\'s a great neighbourhood and a lovely place to be in Seattle. Thanks Patti and Benson. I hope I can come back sometime!  This is a quaint cottage/artist studio in the very attractive leafy suburb of Ballard.  Nice bright airy bedroom upstairs with lovely clean bathroom downstairs.  There is also a nice garden in which to sit and good parking space in lane way behind.  We found public transport close by and easy to use.  Gave us a break away from driving in the congested Seattle traffic!\\r\\nPatti and Benson were really helpful with places to see and answered our many (sorry) questions!  We enjoyed chatting to them and felt that they indeed respected our privacy.\\r\\nWe have unfortunately had a couple of unpleasant Airbnb experiences but we would be happy to stay in their accommodation again.  Thanks gang! My husband and I had such a wonderful time at Patti and Benson\\'s Ballard bnb. The house is beautiful, relaxing, neat, and in a perfect location to enjoy one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle. Patti was a fantastic host. She made us feel right at home, recommended great local restaurants and coffee shops, and we even got to see her artwork in a nearby shop. We will definitely stay here again the next time we\\'re in Seattle.  Patti\\'s studio was amazing and in the middle of great restaurants and not\\nFar from the locks. I really recommend staying there! This place is crisp clean and elegantly comfortable! \\r\\nI was delighted by the smell from the sheets and pillow every night. \\r\\nSitting in the garden, enjoying a cup of tea while the mint and lemon grass in the breeze still blow green...I will always have a smile on my face when I look back:)\\r\\nPatti and Benson made my stay in Seattle such a pleasant experience! Thank you! This couldn\\'t be a better location for us to visit Seattle.\\r\\nThe studio is located in a charming and comfortable house with a beautiful artistic touch and a lot of privacy for its guests. The neighborhood is lovely and has great shops, restaurants and activities and it is also very well connected with downtown through public transportation.  Patti and Benson are very nice and kind people.\\r\\nI can\\'t imagine a better deal than this. My family and I had a wonderful stay at Patti & Benson\\'s bnb! We are happy we could stay in such a beautiful, clean, spacious, and welcoming place.  Patti was such a friendly and helpful host.  It was also an excellent location - close to downtown Ballard, but yet on a quiet street.  We hope to stay there again on future visits to Seattle!  We had a great stay at Patti and Benson\\'s and I would highly recommend staying here! Patti was very accommodating and the house was impeccably clean and inviting. It is located in a quiet neighborhood but there are plenty of dining options within walking distance.  If I ever find myself in Seattle again I would stay here in a heartbeat! Great Location to visit Seattle. We ended up staying a lot in Ballard and only went to downtown Seattle once. \\r\\nThe house is spacious, comfortable and very clean. \\r\\nPatti was very flexible with the arrival time and check out. The house is decorated with Patti\\'s artwork and she is very talented.\\r\\nThere is a little parking area in the back of the house where we left the car for 2 days while we went around by foot or bus. \\r\\nGreat place to stay.  We had a magnificent three days at Patti and Benson\\'s. We couldn\\'t have asked for a more charming place to stay in lovely Ballard. The house was perfectly maintained and beautifully decorated, and our hosts were friendly and accommodating but also gave us a good deal of privacy. I\\'d highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the Seattle area. My girlfriend and I cannot stop discussing a potential move to this magical city someday! Patti is a conscientious and responsive host.  She provided spot-on tips for dining and activities in the Ballard area.  The house is immaculate, peaceful and full of unique character.  The off-street parking in a huge plus as street parking is limited in the neighborhood.  The location is excellent- easy walking distance to most Ballard points of interest.  Ballard is an awesome area- so much going and with quick access to downtown Seattle.  This was our first airbnb experience and a fantastic introduction to an outstanding service. It was a pleasure to meet Patti, see her art work, and enjoy her historical home. I would definitely recommend staying at her place, and enjoy the Ballard area of Seattle. Patti makes you feel right at home. Patti and Benson\\'s were so quick to respond to questions which helped ease my fears since this was our first Airbnb experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were so accommodating to our schedule and didn\\'t mind the fact that we were coming in a little later in the evening after the Mariners game.  Patti was at the place to greet us, show us around, and explain everything to us.  As late as it was, she even stayed to give us suggestions on places to check out while we were visiting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe home itself was great!  We had the place to ourselves during the evenings which was when we were there anyway.  It was clean, spacious, and very close to a everything in Ballard!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s definitely a place I would consider going to again!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Patti and Benson! The Shaw\\'s house in Ballard is clean, quiet, and comfortable.  We enjoyed our stay here and would stay again.  It is close to many restaurants, stores.  You must be able to climb stairs - the bedroom(s) is one story up.  It is very nice to have available the large kitchen and also the table space and shelf room in the bedroom.  There is wifi.  And I found the drive to the U district and downtown to be not too arduous.  Patti\\'s art work makes the place particularly special.    This was my first airbnb experience and I\\'m a convert.  Patti was an exceptionally good communicator and this was very much appreciated when we ran in to troubles at the beginning of our trip. The house was a delight with Patti\\'s beautiful artwork throughout. Ballard is a really pretty suburb and I\\'m so glad we stayed there and not downtown. We were without a car but found no problem at all with the great bus system. Patti and Benson were perfect hosts!  The house is beautiful, super clean, comfortable, and full of art.   It is located in a great neighborhood that has many restaurants, cafes, and bars within easy walking distance.  We felt absolutely safe walking home at night.  The bus to Fremont/downtown is a block away, which made getting around the city easy.   \\r\\nWe felt comfortable, relaxed, and welcome during our time in the house.  I wouldn\\'t even considered staying anywhere else on my next visit to Seattle! \\r\\n Patti and Benson were wonderful and their place was so charming, clean and welcoming. Not only is it a lovely place to stay, but it is in a great location - quiet house but just blocks from everything you might need!  So nice to stay at the Shaw\\'s BNB/Artist studio. Beautiful, clean house. Friendly and inviting hosts. Wonderful neighborhood to explore if you have time. I would stay here again next time i plan a trip to Seattle. I highly recommend staying at this BnB. Would be great a place for a small group (2-4) to stay. Amazing location, space, character, artwork and hosts! We had such a great time staying here. Thank you Patti! Staying at Patti & Benson\\'s place could not have been a better experience! We were fortunate to stay there before and after a very hectic wedding. Their place provided the peace and serenity we needed to balance to the intensity of all that went on during the week. Patti was very accommodating to our ever changing schedule.  We enjoyed visiting with her as we settled in. The location was beyond convenient; the outdoor spaces, the off street parking, the location to downtown Ballard and the one block walk to The Java Bean for a true Seattle Coffee experience; the old world charm of the house, combined with Patti\\'s art and charming, clever and humorous touches were a delight. Everything was clean, comfortable and serene. We appreciated the maps of the area, and the book on Ballard history. We would definitely return and have already recommended their place to others. Patti was a very agreeable host.  She was friendly , considerate,   helpful and always willing to answer questions.  Her art work was lovely, and it added to the ambiance of the accommodations.  We only met Benson once, but he was very friendly as well.  The B & B had a nice bedroom, bathroom and kitchen, and most of the time we were there, we were by ourselves since Patti used her studio space during the day while we were gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur main negative about this stay was in relation to the location of the B and B.  We hadn\\'t realized ahead of time how far away Ballard was from the downtown area.  Since we didn\\'t have a car, we had to rely on buses which were relatively slow, even though frequent.  So, this would not be a good location for people without a car who wanted to explore the city.  Most of the time, after a long day of sight seeing, we didn\\'t feel like another hour bus trip to another neighborhood, so this location limited our evening activities.  But none of this would be a problem if you\\'re traveling with a car.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other caution about this accommodation is that the bathroom is down a steep flight of stairs from the bedroom.  This was clearly mentioned in the description of the property, but it is something to think about if you\\'re elderly or have trouble with stairs. We had a wonderful experience renting from Patti & Benson.  They were very accommodating for our late arrival. The home was very clean and welcoming.  We even received homemade cookies.  Coming from the East Coast the neighborhood was convenient for moving out daughter into Seattle University  and visiting our son 2 blocks away. Off street parking was a plus. We will definitely stay here on future trips.  Patti was a gracious host. The home was super cute, clean and nestled in a lovely neighborhood. I appreciate that we had parking available in the back and had an entire house to ourselves. I would definitely stay here again :) We spent several days in Seattle and loved staying in Patti\\'s house/studio. It was clean and provided a welcome retreat at the end of our busy vacation days out and about in the city. Patty was friendly, welcoming, and helpful. We definitely recommend staying here! Patti and Benson have a tasteful and lovingly restored gem of a house in the heart of Ballard, a pretty and eclectic neighbourhood with lots of interesting shops, restaurants, cafes, bookstores, plus a regular farmer’s market. \\r\\n\\r\\nPatti crafts beautiful artwork from a variety of materials and uses the living room as a studio, but she was super considerate regarding our privacy, and we practically had the entire house to ourselves during our stay. She generously offered us the use of the well-equipped and spotless kitchen, washing machine and small sitting room, in addition to the spacious and comfortable bedroom and great bathroom/shower upstairs. She also took pains to give us maps and helpful advice on the best things to see, do and eat in Ballard. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a fantastic Italian-inspired dinner at Volterra, visited the Ballard Locks and salmon ladder, bought fresh milk, pizza slices and cheese at the Ballard farmers’ market, poked around the independent bookstores, and even spent a quiet afternoon reading in the well-stocked Ballard library just minutes from Patti’s house. There is a large supermarket (QFC) for groceries, personal conveniences and deli meals. There’s really nothing not to like about this. Thanks very much Patti!\\r\\n Stayed here with my adult daughter and had a wonderful time. The neighborhood is great, everything is within walking distance. Patti was a lovely host and we really enjoyed chatting with her about everything from art to the history of the Ballard neighborhood. Thanks for a great stay!  Patti and her husband were great hosts. The house is immaculate -so clean and nicely appointed.  Great location.  Quiet and cozy.   It\\'s actually a very nice sized home and so fairly priced! Thanks again!  Patti\\'s studio was a great way to be in an urban neighborhood and feel at home, but without all the work! The house was extremely clean, filled with light and art and was not cluttered in any way. There is everything you need, and nothing you don\\'t need. The location is perfect for walking to restaurants, bars, the Ballard Locks, and I definitely recommend checking out the Ballard Athletic Club which is only three blocks away and had $8 drop in yoga classes. We would definitely stay here again. It was a great Airbnb experience. Thank you Patti for being such a great host! If you\\'re looking for a charming place to stay with lots of character and within walking distance to restaurants, cafes, yummy bakeries, pubs, etc....then look no further.  Patti and Benson have a minimally decorated, clean studio with all the necessary amenities for a comfortable stay.  Patti was a lovely host and I look forward to staying here on my future visits to Seattle/Ballard.\\r\\nThank-you Patti and Benson What a great place! We loved Patti and Benson\\'s Artist Studio Cottage! So unique and interesting and close to where we wanted to be!! (I love older homes)\\r\\n\\r\\nPatti was very hospitable and welcoming and we enjoyed viewing her art around the house. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe kitchen was perfect (we like to be able to cook for ourselves) and we were so comfortable. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for a great stay!! My partner and I had a great great time staying at Patties and Benson AirBnB.\\r\\nTheir was parking in back of the house for my truck, the house was super clean and very quiet. The bed was perfect as was the fluffy towels and nice water pressure in the bathroom.\\r\\nQFC and downtown Ballard were with easy walking distance.  \\r\\nThey was many restaurants, shops, cafés, and a large theater. We went to a late night movie and walked back to the house and felt safe. The house is a easy drive to down town, the university district, and Queen Anne. Parking is free on Sundays in Seattle so we parked at the Seattle center, walked to Down town and did all the tourist things. We took the tunnel back from Chinatown and the Monorail from West lake center. We both decided that next time we will stay at Patties and Bensons and hangout in Ballard. We both had a great time and got the rest and relaxation we both needed. We would stay there again.\\r\\n Great Bed and Breakfast.  Very quiet and comfortable bedroom.  Centrally located.  Would stay there again A friend and I were visiting Seattle and wanted to stay in a neighborhood outside the downtown but one still accessible to the downtown area and to other Seattle neighborhoods.  This was our first experience on airbnb and staying in Patti and Benson\\'s studio in Ballard was a great experience.  Patti and Benson are incredibly thoughtful hosts and the studio was clean, cozy, and decorated with nice art -- including some by Patti herself.  Patti met us when we arrived rather late from the airport, gave us a tour of the studio and its surrounds, and also directed us to a nearby French bakery serving some of the best croissants we\\'d ever had.  Unfortunately our time in the area was limited and mostly booked, so we weren\\'t able to spend much time enjoying the studio or Ballard\\'s unique offerings except in the evenings and early mornings.  But it was still a wonderful experience and I would recommend the Shaws\\' studio wholeheartedly. Patti and Benson are great hosts and their Ballard accommodation is uniquely creative and comfortable, We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!  Patti met us warmly when we arrived and showed us the rooms, which were spacious. Her Ballard Artist\\'s Studio is comfortable and warm, very neat and clean, and sprinkled with her art, which my children and I enjoyed looking at and talking about together. The beds were comfortable and the house stayed warm through the night, despite the Seattle chill outside. If we had needed anything, I knew Patti was nearby and accessible by phone. The studio\\'s location suited us perfectly; it\\'s a few blocks from our favorite bagel source, as well as the Ballard Branch Library and Market Street. We would gladly choose to stay here again!\\r\\n The home is clean and beautifully decorated with a personal touch that permeates it very being.  Patti is a wonderful presence; we enjoyed our conversations and her art.   With the added benefit of easy access to public transportation we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and all that Seattle has to offer.  I would highly recommend this accommodation to anyone who might be interested in a visit to Seattle. Staying with Patty and Benson was awsome. Their house is a beatifull mixture of eclectic and eterial . Patty\\'s art pieces thogether with little tresures each with its unique story - draw you to linger and think about people who made them . \\nThe accomodation was impecable and location in the heart of Bollard made everything very close - miryad of galleries, cafes , restaurants small eclectic stores , parks all connected by cobble stone streets - take you to a magical place. \\nPatty and Benson are very sweet friendly artsy couple who\\'s quiet spirit made us feel very welcome to their beatiful home . Will come back again! My son and I spent Christmas at Patti and Benson\\'s lovely house in Ballard.  We had a great time and with a very comfortable and cozy\\r\\nkitchen we created a great Christmas dinner.  The house is very clean and fun.  It has a light and airy feeling with all the comforts you would want, the bathroom is great and visitor friendly.  As artists they have added unique touches that make it more \\r\\npersonal and eclectic.  I would highly recommend it for anyone. \\r\\nAnd location is perfect! This is a great place to stay. The large bedroom upstairs looks out on the street and is very bright and comfortable. The bathroom is downstairs and has a good tub/shower. The hosts are welcoming and only around during the day. You can walk to the grocery, library, bookstores, coffee houses, excellent restaurants (including Ballard Annex Oyster House at 5410 Ballard Ave NW), and to the working waterfront. Ballard is a great neighborhood and convenient to downtown via the #40 bus. I recommend this property without reservation. We found Patti and Benson\\'s place to be charmingly comfortable and well appointed. Patti was friendly and helpful. The Ballard location can\\'t be beat for a Seattle visit. We enjoyed the clean, ample space.  It was so nice to be able to make a cup of tea or coffee in our kitchen, sit at the table to visit, sit on the couch in the sitting room to read and sleep on very comfortable beds.  Patti met us upon arrival and was very kind and accommodating. Superb value.  Have been staying at Patti\\'s studio the past month and it has been great; she looks after things very well.  The studio is just my sort of place:  a lovely older house well looked after and in close proximity to all the action in Ballard.  You can walk to the movies, the pubs, the cafes, the restaurants and the groceries.  Old Ballard is only 10 minutes away by foot through a very tidy neighborhood.  I am looking forward to my next month at the studio.  We had our second stay at Patti and Benson\\'s place. The nicest hosts and place. The location and setting are perfect for our twice annual event. What a joy to know that we can stay there and have such beautiful hospitality and convenience. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks again for the fabulous stay!!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth and Jim Patti & Benson have a lovely home. It is clean, nicely decorated, and they provided even more amenities than we needed. Ballard is a really nice neighborhood with interesting shops and good restaurants. Patti & Benson were very nice about us being there with our toddler. There was a lot she could get into, but they trusted that we could prevent her from causing any major or minor catastrophes, which I greatly appreciated. I would recommend staying here. It\\'s a great spot for the price!  Patti\\'s studio is a lovely house, perfectly positioned in the heart of Ballard.  The house we clean and well equipped.  Patti was flexible in meeting is late when our flight got delayed and we were able to stay an extra night as well.  The location is ideal for walking to breweries, morning bakeries, and just down the street from the bus line going downtown.  The only downside was a weak internet signal, but we found we\\'d rather be out and about, not surfing the web at home, so it wasn\\'t really a problem.  Patti was really nice, but we only saw her at check in.  Otherwise, it was like we had the house to ourselves.  \\nWe would definitely stay here again! The pictures simply don\\'t do it justice! My boyfriend and I stayed for a few nights in April and have a wonderful time. The place was charming, unique and absolutely why we love travelling with AirBnB. Patti was a gracious host, the space was large, clean and felt like a home away from home. The location was great, walking distance from a grocery store, a great coffee shop and the Ballard main strip, not to mention easy to commute downtown. We couldn\\'t have been happier with our stay or recommend this more!   We had a great stay in this house that is charming and clean as a whistle.  Patti is a most welcoming hostess, and we found the accommodations attractive and comfortable.  Would not be the best for someone who has trouble with stairs so be sure to take note if stairs would be an issue.  This is a great location and we loved having off street parking. We hope to return.  Thanks, Patti! I booked Patti and Benson\\'s house for my parents and their friends who were visiting town. They absolutely loved it. The house itself is just a few blocks from central Ballard, which is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Seattle. Patti has a studio in the house but is not intrusive at all, and my parents were exited to meet a local. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place!  The property was beautiful, comfortable and very clean. Patti was very nice and helpful and provided information about the house and the area to help us enjoy our stay.  Would absolutely recommend this property and host.  Loved this area of Seattle. Patti & Benson were wonderful hosts.  Charming place just blocks from Ballard\\'s best places, very clean, great communication.  Would recommend a stay to anyone visiting Seattle for a few days/weeks. Our last stay on our 3-week trip of the westcoast was one of the highlights of our still brief experience with AirBnb. Patti made us feel at home from the beginning. The house is super clean and lovely decorated. We wanted to stay longer to enjoy the beautiful garden, house and above all Pattis company. The Ballard district is flourishing and offers many great places to eat and relax.  Patti and Benson were very accommodating and run a clean, comfortable and roomy Airbnb.  If you like a quaint and unique urban setting the Ballard / Fremont area is the place.  This Airbnb is located conveniently to these Seattle neighborhoods. \\n\\nWe will definitely return. Second stay at Patti\\'s place and it was as nice and convenient as it was last year.   Patti is very responsive to email and communicates promptly.  She is a great hostess.  We will definitely use Patti\\'s place again whenever we have guests in Ballard.  We had an enjoyable stay at Patti and Benson\\'s airbnb.  It was immaculately clean and the Ballard location was perfect.  There was plenty of space inside and a picnic table on the lawn outdoors.  The bed was very comfortable.  The narrow, winding staircase between the upstairs bedroom and downstairs bathroom could pose a problem for people with balance or mobility problems, but there\\'s an excellent bannister and we were fine with the situation.  Patti was very friendly and helpful. We loved staying at Patti and Bensons beautiful Ballard Artist Studio. The house is in an amazing location - very close to cafes, supermarkets and everything you need including a bus to downtown. The house was very clean, the bed was super comfortable and there was so much space. Patti and Benson are kind, friendly and understand how to be the \"perfect air bnb hosts.\" We highly recommend staying here on your travels to Seattle! Another great stay at the Ballard Artist\\'s Studio. Patti and Benson are very kind and accommodating hosts. I love walking down to the Ballard neighborhood shops and restaurants. Thanks again!  We were very pleased with our stay. Patti and Benson were wonderful hosts, very welcoming. The house is clean and very well situated in Ballard. Would defently recommend staying in Ballard when visiting Seattle, great neighbourhood. \\r\\nThe stay was everything we expected and good value for money. \\r\\nOnly thing that was negative  was the fact that the whole living room was occupied (the one in all the pictures) so there were few places to relax in the house.  Patti and Benson were excellent hosts, their space was clean, and not to mention huge. It was really neat getting to share the space with Patti during the week, her artwork is super incredible, and she is very sweet. I was using their space during an apartment search, and it was very easy for me to work in the space as well as cook. The studio is also super close to downtown Ballard, so you can walk to all sorts of bars and restaurants. a lovely home on a quiet street but walkable to lots of restaurants.  very thoughtful hosts.  would welcome the chance to stay again. The most beautiful house/ art studio  truly !\\r\\nWe could not get over how amazing this place was \\r\\nGracious comfortable 100 year old house very artistically \\r\\nAppointed every detail is lovely as can be \\r\\n\\r\\nComfy light filled bedroom beautiful sitting areas \\r\\nPatty\\'s art is just beautiful I certainly wanted to buy the piece hanging on the wall\\r\\n tasteful art work and ephemera throughout thr house \\r\\nI could move in tomorrow without blinking \\r\\n\\r\\nClose to lovely ballard shops restaurants and \\r\\nAmazing bakery around the corner \\r\\n\\r\\nHit a snag trying to cancel our reserve as our timing on our \\r\\nTrip had changed and I missed the cancel date by one half day \\r\\nSo if five day cancel be aware of the window ! I was unclear \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had hoped for a refund  if patty could rent it out easily \\r\\nBut  patty did not want to do that at all\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we pAid for three nights and stayed one ! \\r\\nbig ouch ! We would have been happy with a credit as well for future use \\r\\n\\r\\nAs we are frequent air b nb users it was a costly mistake \\r\\nThat We c ertainly won\\'t make again that\\'s for sure !!\\r\\n\\r\\nLovely place to stay great locale and price  and patty welcomed us with \\r\\nSome great chocolate as well \\r\\n Patti was there to meet us upon arrival and gave us a quick tour of the place--mentioned where to get groceries, explained any house tidbits--in a nutshell, set us up nicely.\\r\\ngreat place to stay to explore Ballard in a quiet neighborhood. charming and relaxing.  The house is a super quaint old house on a quiet street. Patti is an artist and had her beautiful art on display in her studio. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook dinner and eat out in yard on her picnic table. Ballard is a hip neighborhood where coffee shops are plentiful and people watching is a blast. Sunday was the farmers market with delicious food options. My husband loved that the water pressure was very good in the shower. We easily took the bus to Seattle center and Pike market from Ballard. The upstairs gets a little warm but at night we were comfortable with the provided fans. The only bathroom is on the first floor so it\\'s a little tricky for night visits. All in all we loved the Ballard house and highly recommend it.  We loved staying in this beautiful, clean and comfortable retreat.  Very convenient to Ballard\\' s best shops and restaurants.  The bus stop at the end of the alley made travel to downtown and other neighborhoods quick and easy.   She was really kind and nice. And the house was really clean and neat. \\r\\nShe showed me her studio where she worked. It was interesting and one of a unique point of the house.  Patti and Benson were wonderful hosts. They gave us very useful information about the neighborhood; what to see and do in this interesting part of Seattle. The house was clean and very well kept. Patti and Benson were very kind and welcoming. Patti was helpful with any information I needed to find my way around the neighborhood. The house was very neat and clean, which is very important to me. Patti\\'s art studio was so interesting and unique. It was a pleasure to meet this interesting couple. I would stay there again. Location: Ballard has many good restaurants and bars so it\\'s so nice location. Patti\\'s art studio nearby are good bakery and good 24h-open grocery. And a bus stop takes only 3 minutes walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoom: There is very beautiful & artistic. I really like. Bedroom and bathroom are also clean, comfortable. The kitchen is good I enjoyed cooking.\\r\\n\\r\\nHost: Patti is really kindness person! I met Benson only a few minutes, but I think he also very kindly man. I really look forward to see them again. I\\'ll definitely request to book their house on Airbnb! Patti and Benson are wonderful hosts with a beautiful home in a quaint, seaside neighborhood. Ballard is a walkable community, perfect for exploring and conveniently located near Golden Gardens Park (beach with public fire pits). I had a magical experience popping in and out of the local shops, walking along the beach, and enjoying this artistic home. I would highly recommend this Airbnb! This is our third time with Patti and Benson. This location works perfectly for our event and the place is charming and both Patti and Benson are so accommodating and welcoming! We really enjoying seeing Patti\\'s art throughout the house, also! \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks again for being wonderful hosts!\\r\\nhugs, Elizabeth and Jim Patti made us feel very welcome. Our space was roomy and very clean. Great location in the city.\\r\\nIt was fun to visit with such a talented artist. Patti and Benson\\'s place is just lovely. Communication was clear and very helpful. The location is perfect with great neighborhoods to wander around, good restaurants, consignment shops and convenient to downtown Seattle. We\\'ll definitely recommend this to friends and stay here again. Patti was a wonderful host and the studio is charming. She gave a great tour of the house and shared useful information about the neighborhood, including a fantastic breakfast tip: there\\'s an incredible bakery right around the corner with the best croissants and quiche you could imagine outside of France. The house is impeccably clean and the bed/bath were perfect--a great base to explore beautiful Ballard.     Place was decorative, clean and peacefull and I think it suits very well for families or for couples. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are interested in hanging around Ballard-area this is a great place to stay. (there are lots of nice cafés, one situated just nearby is called \"Java Bean Coffee House\") \\r\\n\\r\\nBallard was fairly difficult to reach through the public transportation (King County Metro). I wished to visit cinemas in downtown area so this was a bit of a bummer, but I only had needed to check this out before I made my booking. Ofcourse, if you travel with your own car public transportation is not a problem and the place suits you much better! We LOVED staying with Patti, who is a fantastic host. This was one of the best AirBnB experiences I\\'ve had. The space is clean, unique, and beautiful. The Ballard location is also fantastic - walking distance from fabulous coffee shops and shopping. I\\'d highly recommend staying here if you\\'re coming through Seattle!  We had a wonderful stay at Patti and Benson\\'s Airbnb in Ballard. They are thoughtful and considerate hosts who have created a warm, comfortable atmosphere in their 100 year old home. We loved being a few blocks away from downtown Ballard and a great grocery store.  The #40 bus to downtown Seattle was just a block away.  Our stay at Patti and Benson\\'s was perfect and we highly recommend their place for your stay in Ballard. We truly enjoy staying at Patti and Benson\\'s BnB! Their 100 year old home/Patti\\'s studio is graceful, artful and comfortable. The location is close to wonderful shops and cafes in the community of Ballard and public transportation into to downtown Seattle is frequent and easy to access. We really enjoyed staying here.  Patti made us feel welcome and at home.  The  house is very clean and comfortable.  The off-street parking and location are perfect.  It is within walking distance of the old Ballard area of shops and restaurants.  Highly recommend...\\r\\n Patti\\'s place is always comfy, easy, and a great place to stay.  This is probably the third time we\\'ve stayed there. Patti was an excellent host - friendly and helpful, but unobtrusive. The house was immaculate and comfortable, and beautifully equipped for a multi-day stay. The neighborhood is very pleasant and has many conveniences - grocery, restaurants, buses, library, parks, etc. We LOVE staying at Patti and Benson\\'s lovely airbnb. It is a perfect location for our twice a year event. AND we love the beautiful old home with it\\'s nooks and crannies and living with Patti\\'s super art! \\r\\n\\r\\nI love the bedrooms and EVERYTHING is super clean. YAY!!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving a kitchen is a huge plus. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey are both very welcoming and friendly. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was our 4th or 5th stay with them and we will do it again. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a great time we had last weekend. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you so much! Great stay - really nice and characterful house a very short from bars and restaurants of Ballard. Very clean and comfortable, and quiet at night on this residential street. Patti was flexible and hospitable as a host. Would stay again :-) This was such an easy airbnb experience! Patti was so helpful and great upon check-in, and then I had everything I needed: full run of the kitchen, clean bathroom, beautiful bedroom. I had absolutely zero complaints or concerns while staying there, the place is beautiful, clean, quiet, and walking distance to all the shops, restaurants, bars and coffee places in Ballard. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in Ballard, especially if you need a 2 bedroom place, the home is enormous and you will generally have the whole place to yourself.  Great stay at Ballard Artist\\'s Studio! Patti Shaw, our host, was welcoming and sweet, and her art work is exquisite. It surrounds you in this beautifully quaint, coastal cottage. The simplicity of the design and the decor helps create a calm and casual atmosphere, a perfect getaway. Tremendous neighborhood with a wonderful stretch of shops and restaurants in Ballard. Coffee everywhere. Downtown Seattle just minutes away. Thank you, Patti and Benson! We\\'ll be back someday.  The aesthetic at the house is lovely and peaceful. We enjoyed the quiet stay there and felt very comfortable. It\\'s also just a short walk to great restaurants and coffee shops like La Isla and Hot Cakes. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The house is pristine and beautiful with a fabulous, central location within walking distance to (website hidden) - the shower is awesome! \\nThanks much to Patti and Benson - we\\'ll be back. I had a wonderful experience staying at Patti\\'s. She was readily available by text, gave me a warm welcome, and it was so fun seeing all of her artwork. The house itself is beautiful, and in a great location. Having parking in the back alley is AWESOME. I would definitely return on another trip to Ballard!  Patti and Benson\\'s home is a historic and artistic delight in the midst of  a wonderful Ballard neighborhood.   The listing was quite accurate and Patti even made sure we knew that the bedrooms were upstairs and the bathroom downstairs.  Patti gave us a warm welcome to her simple and tastefully decorated and charming 100 year old home/studio.  The beds were comfy - the linens and towels lovely.   There is even off street parking and a short walk to some of Ballard\\'s best coffee and bakeries .   Patti and Benson made us feel right at home at their beautiful artist studio.  We loved being able to go to the Ballard farmer\\'s market, just a 5 minute walk away, and cook a delicious and local meal.  The location is perfect to entertain yourself during your stay with lots of different activities, but also perfect to relax in the beautifully landscaped yard.  Best of both worlds.  The listing is accurate and I highly recommend staying here. Patti gave us a warm welcome and was a very helpful host! We enjoyed staying at her original and lovingly decorated studio in the middle of beautiful Ballard. Thank you so much again and all the best, Rebecca and Miriam Lovely artisan home in great location! Very warm and welcoming! Thank you Patti and Benson! I will book again when I am back in the Ballard area! We really enjoyed staying at the Studio, although this belies the fact that you have the whole house with Patti and Benson in the house opposite at the rear.  Patti was so delightful, friendly and helpful.  My wife and I stayed two nights on our own and were then joined by my wife\\'s brother and sister-in-law for one night only.  There is a tremendous selection of shops and restaurants very close by and Ballard is a lovely friendly area.  We certainly recommend the Studio without any hesitation. We really enjoyed our stay with Patti and Benson.  We especially liked Patti\\'s artist\\'s touch to the house and being able to see her studio up close. Quiet and comfortable but only a few blocks from the centre of Ballard with all of its food and fun. Patti met us at the door and made us feel very welcome. She gave us a tour of the Lodging and provided us with valuable information about Seattle. The BnB was exactly as it was listed and the neighborhood was excellent Patti was a great hostess--a memorable person creating memorable experiences/stays in her beautiful artist studio. I loved discovering the little unique touches around the house! I also loved the location, which is within walking distance of restaurants, boutiques, grocery store, library, park, and, of course, the wonderful Ballard farmer\\'s market on the weekend. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay! The listing is accurate and the pictures give you a good idea of the ambiance. I highly recommend staying here. This is the perfect place to stay if you\\'re looking for a great Seattle experience!  Patti was incredibly welcoming, made sure we were comfortably settled and had great suggestions for places to check out around town!  The house itself is super cute, clean, and is very well located.  Highly recommend.   The tour was clear, fun, and brief.  Patti showed us some of her artwork at our request.  My parents enjoyed the quiet neighborhood and comfortable front porch surrounded by lush foliage with morning coffees in hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will certainly recommend Patti and Benson\\'s place to out of town visitors! Patti welcomed us warmly and spent quite a bit of time answering my questions about her art and talking also about the neighborhood and Seattle.  Very friendly and accomodating! Patti and Benson were great.  Fun neighborhood and easy parking.  Quaint old home. As a return guest, I am happy to announce it was delightful as the last time I stayed at the artist\\'s studio. Thank you Patti & Benson for making me feel right at home. Wonderful hosts, only saw Benson briefly but did speak with Patti a few times during the visit.  Beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood, walking distance to a public garden and the locks as well as multiple places to eat.  Would definitely stay here again when in the area. Thanks!  Nice stay at your studio and look forward to our next visit.....easy visit and comfortable. A most wonderful experience: great location, easy transport to downtown and the airport and shopping near by. Patti and Benson were wonderful hosts! From check-in to check-out, they were always friendly and gave the best suggestions on local food and different neighborhood attractions. The house is filled with their own artwork, which adds an even more personal touch. Because they live in the house directly behind, we often exchanged \"good morning\\'s\" on our way to grab breakfast and explore. To say this house and it\\'s hosts are welcoming would truly be an understatement. I highly suggest! Nestled in Ballard, it\\'s also quite convenient as everything is walking distance.  This is our second stay with Patti and Benson, and just like the first it was exemplary. Patti and Benson were accommodating, kind and so helpful. Their place is beautiful, walking distance to everything we wanted to visit in Ballard and filled with gorgeous art. They truly go out of their way to make your trip perfect without ever feeling intrusive. We can\\'t wait to stay with them again soon! The location was absolutely amazing if you want to be in Ballard.  It is a very easy walk down to the main thoroughfare where all the restaurants, shops and bars are located.  Patti is an excellent host.  She made sure I had everything I needed and is nearby if you need anything during your stay.  The house is beautiful and comfortable.  One thing to keep in mind for some guests is that the only restroom is downstairs, but you will be sleeping upstairs.  This isn\\'t a problem for me, but for some people it might be an issue.  I highly recommend this host, and this rental.  I would stay here again.  Patti is a lovely host.  I enjoyed the historic house, and it was convenient to public transportation (I didn\\'t have a car).  I wasn\\'t there long enough to take advantage of all the amenities (like the kitchen), but it certainly was a great place to stay. It was a very nice stay in Pattis house.  Quite neighborhood and only 30 mitutes from down town. also the bus connection to Seattle is quick and easy to manage. \\nSo we really enjoyed our time Nous avons passé un très bon moment au studio. Patti et Benson sont des gens très charmants. Le logement  correspond exactement à la description. Le quartier est paisible avec de nombreux restaurants et magasins accessibles à pied.  Patti was an exceptional host... She gave us lots of advice. House artist with a great soul. Exhibition of the work of Patti in the House : fantastic... Place very clean, near shopping and downtown Seattle. We strongly recommend. Patti was great to work with (we didn\\'t get to meet Benson). She met us at the house at the agreed upon time and made us feel welcome. It\\'s a 100-year old house so bedrooms are upstairs and the bathroom is on the first floor which could be a challenge for some people. The bathroom was my favorite, nicely remodeled and filled with artwork. The house is half a block from the bus stop and a block and a half from a nice grocery store. It\\'s a great location. We rode the bus to Pike Market and spent the morning there. After a nap, it was a short drive to the ship locks and Ray\\'s Café for dinner. What a great place to stay in Seattle. The three of us had a good time in Ballard! Patti and Benson made us feel very welcome on our first ever visit to Seattle with a nice chat in the garden, with practical info on the environment, the city, public transport etc. The house was very clean, with beautiful art all around. A pleasure to see and to live in. The house is located in a small, quiet street with amble space for parking at the back of the house. Description and pictures on the website give a very good image of the house, rooms and it surroundings. Certainly a place we would recommend. Everything was as advertised.  Perfectly fine. We expect to return. Patti is a great host! Very easy to communicate with and helped us figure out places to go in Seattle. Patti had tons of brochures and bus schedules in her house which was super helpful! Also, we got the entire house which also doubles as Patti\\'s art studio but that wasn\\'t an issue and we only ran into each other once! Fantastic art work in the  house too! Highly recommend! Patti and Benson were great hosts. The studio fit our needs perfectly since we were attending a wedding nearby. It is a clean, well appointed studio. An added treat was spending time with Patti as she walked us through her studio and shared her creations. Thanks! Our hosts were warm and welcoming and showed us around their historic home in the quiet Ballard neighborhood. Great facilities - great kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and lots of maps / touring info . Easy Seattle access. Short walk to fast bus downtown - can leave the car at home! Would stay again.  Patti was very welcoming and her studio is a very beautiful 100 year old house that is her active studio and packed with wonderful art. She is there during the day but we had the house to ourselves at night. It\\'s walkable to Ballard Avenue and is in a charming residential neighborhood. This is a great place to stay for a weekend in Seattle.  We found the Ballard Artist\\'s Studio a delightful and attractive place to stay.  Patti welcomed us warmly, and made sure that we were comfortable with her arrangements. The photos faithfully tell the story:  the place is lovely, light, clean, interesting, a characteristically well-crafted Ballard bungalow.  The location in Ballard is excellent:  a short walk to a choice of coffee shops and bakery, a bit further to the central down down Ballard area and the famous Ballard Avenue.  The parking situation in back of the B&B is easily accessed from a main thoroughfare.    The price is reasonable. Located in Ballard area and Patti&Benson\\'s house was simply FABULOUS! Patti gave us clear and specific introductions and we could directly feel more than 100 years of history of the house.\\r\\nWatching Patti\\'s artwork all over the house was also fantasticl!! Would definitely stay again!! Thumbs up! My family and I live in Ballard; I booked the Artist\\'s Studio for my mother while she was in town for a visit.  Go ahead and book it - you won\\'t regret it!\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly recommend both the accommodations and Patti\\'s hospitality as a host.  In terms of the latter, Patti was very responsive and communicated with me well throughout the process.  It was a pleasure interacting with her and learning the history of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of the accommodations, it\\'s a beautiful older house a few minutes walk from everything in downtown Ballard.  The bedrooms are nicely decorated and very comfortable.  When my mother arrived, there was a liter of Talking Rain (sparkling water) waiting in the refrigerator.   The bathroom is very nice and, according to my mother, the hot water is quick and plentiful.  Bonus points for being very well-lit at night, as it made my mother feel safe when she walked home. We love staying there! Patti and Benson are super hosts. The house is interesting with Patti\\'s art everywhere. We really enjoy this kind of house that is older and beautifully kept up. It is a perfect spot for our bi-annual event. The kitchen is great with a fun pantry. \\nThanks again to Patti and Benson!! The Ballard Artist Studio was a great place to stay in a walkable neighborhood with amenities nearby. Communication with Patti was easy and responsive. She provided a nice tour of the house and gave helpful local recommendations. The studio has a lot of charm, and has everything you need for a short stay. Off-street parking was a nice bonus. I had a truly lovely time staying in the artist\\'s studio. The house itself was charming, unique and quite cozy. Those neighborhood was great for walking around and getting a feel for a distinct part of Seattle. I had the chance to chat with Patti and witness some of her creations- very special! She was so helpful and kind. Would definitely come back and stay again.  Wonderful accommodation in the Ballard neighborhood. Patti was welcoming and helpful. Old Ballard and Freemont are close by and you will see some of Patti\\'s work in various treasure filled shops! Downtown is a little ways away, but taking the bus in means you don\\'t need to deal with parking etc..  On first arrival the house was beautiful and welcoming. Patti and Benson are very nice hosts. A great perk to the home was the off street parking. This home was relaxing and unique. I would recommend this home to others. Lovely stay at Patti and Benson\\'s Artist Studio.  Great communication, really nice place, very clean, comfortable.  The bed and linens are comfy!  I travel by bike (and train) and Patti had set up a secure place for my bike in the house -- a good accommodating touch.  Patti and Benson are, of course, very knowledgeable about Seattle should you need suggestions.  Their place is in a great location in Ballard, very close to lots of action, and access to bike trails and transit to take me further in my explorations of Seattle.  Altogether a positive experience! It was my first Airbnb experience and it was really good! The studio was clean, quiet and very convenient. There are a lot of Patti\\'s art works in the studio, which was super cool. Patti was very nice, and she told me lots of useful information about Seattle and Ballard. I\\'d love to stay here next time! Our hosts Debra and Jordan made us feel very welcome.  We had a late arrival.  The lights were on and a note was left with contact information in case we had any trouble with the lock to enter.  The room was charming with loads of history attached.  The room preserved the feeling of history fused with modern comfort and convenience.  There is a separate entrance and the room has a private bath.  The hosts left no stone unturned.  There were mints on the nightstand upon arrival and the room had a television, coffee maker, snacks and all the touches of home with a restaurant guide.  The wifi included was easy to log into with no glitches.  Thank you to the hosts for such a wonderful stay in a beautiful neighborhood with great coffee and world class pastries just down the street.  I would highly recommend staying here!  The hosts are gracious and the room is beyond charming.   Staying at this Historic Ballard House was my first Airbnb experience, and it surpassed even my highest expectations.  Debra was so kind and such a wonderful host, and it made my trip even better.  She was so accommodating and helpful, taking the time to explain to me how Airbnb works, as well as giving me tips on where to venture in the neighborhood.  The private room is everything you need for a stay in Ballard.  It is clean, comfortable and charming, and it is in a great location to explore Ballard, which is a beautiful neighborhood with lots to offer.  Both the home and location are as wonderful as the host, and I would recommend staying here to anyone! Debra\\'s place is great! It\\'s a fantastic private room with a huge private bathroom in a beautiful old home within walking distance of tons of shops, excellent restaurants AND one of the best record stores in the country (Bop Street Records.) I had a wonderful stay here. The in-room coffee, wi-fi and cable TV were delicious icing on an already tasty cake.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecommended. The reservation was canceled 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Yes, the host was most welcoming!  The neighborhood is perfect due to all the markets, cafes, and sites are in walking distance.  The host met us at the door. He was quite friendly Elin\\'s place was just as described.  Quiet, clean, good location, comfortable bed, very easy to walk to the many restaurants and bars of Ballard.  A 15-minute walk to the D-line took us right to downtown Seattle\\'s Pike Street.  From there, easy to navigate the city.   Elin was wonderful. The room is large, bed very comfy. The house was clean and well laid-out. Having access to do laundry and use the kitchen was great. Her house is close to downtown and lots of fun things to do. Quiet neighborhood. I had a lovely stay and would absolutely stay with her again. Great stay! Quiet, clean, cozy, and thoughtfully arranged.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really like Ballard; it\\'s a nice quiet getaway from the downtown hustle & bustle, while still being walkable with lots to do and easy transit access.\\r\\n\\r\\n Place was quiet and comfy and the location was very convenient. We arrived late and the key was missing from the lockbox, but Elin quickly came and let us in. Street parking was easy to find nearby. Elin was a great host. The room was clean and comfortable. The electronic keypad was very convenient.  The location was great. We did not have any problems finding a street parking spot.  We highly recommend this place. What an amazing space! I absolutely loved the room and  Elin was a great host. A+ The description of this Nautical Bedroom was accurate. The room was very well appointed, comfortable, private, new-feeling, and clean. The location of the condo is excellent, walking distance to the downtown Ballard area (Market Street), yet the neighborhood is quiet and safe. Finding parking on the nearby streets was easy. I loved having access to the washer and dryer right outside our door. The combination lock on the front door worked great--no key necessary. The kitchen was also great--it was very clean and had everything I needed, including free coffee and plenty of space in the refrigerator for food storage. I appreciated the shampoo, conditioner, liquid soap, and hairdryer.  It was fun meeting Elin--she was super nice yet I hardly saw her during my four-night stay. The whole overnight experience was very quiet and private. Thank you! I really enjoyed my stay at Elin\\'s!  My arrival time was a little approximate and I appreciated that she was ok with this; the electronic keypad lock made it easy to come and go, in general. The Nautical Room was just as it appears - simply and tastefully decorated, and everything was very clean, comfortable and felt very private, despite sharing the home with other people.  The bathroom amenities (shower toiletries and hair dryer) were super convenient, as was knowing there were plenty of extra towels if needed. The duvet on the bed was toasty, and there was also an extra blanket in the closet if you need a little something extra.  Happily, the wifi signal was strong in the room, and Elin left a card with login information that was easy to use.  Multiple outlets were accessible for charging.  As a first time Airbnb user, I had some trepidation about sharing someone else\\'s home, but the way the townhouse is set up you don\\'t really feel like you\\'re traipsing through someone else\\'s space to get to the 3rd floor rooms, which made me more comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\\'t really take advantage of the main floor access other than to store some leftovers in the fridge and briefly chat with Elin when I ran into her on my way in/out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is fantastic - I had wanted to spend time in the Ballard neighborhood, and this was very walkable to some great coffee shops, bars and restaurants on the main street, but still quiet and felt very safe.  Only a few minutes\\' walk from the Ballard Locks, as well.  I purposely did a lot of walking, but saw that there was easy bus access if you plan to use public transit, and street parking was pretty reasonable.\\r\\n\\r\\nElin was a great host, and really helped give me confidence in the Airbnb experience.  I easily recommend staying with her, and hope to have an opportunity to visit again. Our stay was great, just like last time. I highly recommend staying here. Location is perfect and all needs are met for a wonderful stay. Elin\\'s house was very easy to access, close to central Ballard, and totally clean. The sleeping accommodations were extremely comfy and Elin was very warm and welcoming! I would definitely stay here again! :) Elin\\'s room was really good! It was all the way we expected it to be. Very clean, enough space and a comfortable bed. Elin was a very nice host and we had our privacy. The neighborhood is safe and quiet but all the bars and restaurants are within walking distance and there are plenty of them. The area itself is more than awesome. We could have spent at least a week more here. Also when it comes to exploring seattle this place is a very good starting point. All in all we can really recommend this place when you want to visit seattle!  We enjoyed our stay at Elin\\'s townhouse. It was just as pictured, clean and we\\'ll decorated and close to downtown Ballard. Elin\\'s room was a perfect spot to stay for a weekend exploring all Seattle has to offer. The location is almost perfect! If you don\\'t know Ballard, you should get to know it, and staying here is the perfect opportunity to do so. Some of Seattle\\'s newest and best restaurants are nearby, within walking distance, and Ballard\\'s charming main street is blocks away - complete with its own restaurants and a weekly farmer\\'s market!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house itself is tucked away just off a main thoroughfare, so it\\'s easy to access and find. The setup is comfortable, quaint, and inviting, with main floor access that includes a kitchen and open living space.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room itself is exactly as described, and again provides a wonderfully comfortable space - just enough to unwind with ease. The bathroom is spacious and includes fresh linens, soap/shampoos if you need them, and a hair dryer just in case! \\r\\n\\r\\nI would absolutely stay here again. The home and neighbors were incredibly quiet, there was a small market and liquor store within walking distance, and downtown Seattle was a cheap uber or transit ride away.  The listing was accurately described.  Elin was a good hostess.  She procured items for us that were dwindling in a timely manner.  She gave us our privacy which is always good for me as we were in Seattle to visit son and grandkids and I talk a lot, so we were able to get on our way quickly.  The bed was quite comfortable.  There was heat adjustment in the room itself so the ambient temperature was nice.  Some additional clean dishes would have been helpful at breakfast time but certainly not a deal breaker.  Liked the hair dryer.  Thank you, Elin, for a wonderful visit to Ballard and my son. The room was wonderful, very clean and beautiful with a private bathroom.  The location was very private and quiet.  I had a very pleasant stay and Elin was very kind and accommodating. The room was exactly as described. The bed was really comfortable and the bedding was warm and soft. I felt like I was right at home. The bathroom is really clean and the shower is very easy to use. It\\'s a quiet house with very little noise from the street. I didn\\'t really have a chance to say more than hi or bye to Elin since I was out looking at apartments for most of my trip, but she was very kind during our brief encounters. I would recommend this room to my friends.  Chris was such a great host! He left the place clean and stocked with lots of nice treats.  Plus he was incredibly responsive to all questions and was always ready with extra advice to make things easy. The place itself is crazy cute with lots of room for everyone. It was a nice surprise to be within wlking distance from so many great shops too. Loved this house completely! This 1920\\'s remodeled home was comfortable, adorable and full of character!  We didn\\'t get a chance to sleep in the airstream. :( My 2 friends and I were literally just staying there for 7 hours of shut eye.  Chris was quick to respond to all my questions and was very helpful.  Ballard is such a cute and vibrant town.  The home is on a beautiful residential street.  Our GPS got a little confused finding the home, but that\\'s technology for you. We felt safe and comfortable. To paraphrase: we\\'ll be back.  Great place.  Loved staying in the airstream.  An awesome place to stay in Seattle and a true Air BnB experience! Chris\\'s house and airstream are full of character, nice and clean, and there\\'s a full kitchen and comfy beds. Chris was really helpful and super friendly. The area is great - loads of good coffee and groceries, and a real west coast vibe. We thoroughly recommend a stay! We stayed three delightful nights. We found a private parking space, a modern well-stocked kitchen (with a big bowl full of treats--thank you!), a cozy living/dining area, excellent beds in the bedrooms, and a full bath with an actual TUB.  Another unexpected plus was the washer/dryer, complete with supplies.  The Ballard neighborhood is eclectic, close to lots of interesting shops and sites.  This house is also only two blocks from a city bus line that goes to downtown Seattle. The WiFi worked fine.\\r\\nThe main apartment is a second floor walk-up in an older home with lots of character. One of the bedrooms is a converted attic space with skylights.  Our last night we had rain on the roof--what a wonderful way to sleep!  We did not use the Airstream, but it looked really cool in there. We had a great stay at this beautiful home! Chris was quick with responding to any questions I had and a pleasure to meet. Amazing time at Chris\\'s home. Love the house and old school it felt. Would love to come back!!! Aloha  It was great. Chris was very responsive and the place worked perfect for our one night stay. Fantastic experience. Chris was insanely helpful and everything went exactly as expected. The house is quite old and has some quirks but every single detail has been attended to, the location is outstanding, and the price is perfectly reasonable. Chris has stocked the house with new, fluffy towels - new sheets and everything is perfectly comfortable. I\\'d stay there again without any hesitation.  Chris was such an amazing host. I could not be more pleased with our stay.  He provided immediate communication and answered all of our questions fully and detailed so when we walked into the home it was with ease. The home itself is hands down the best airbnb my friends and I have stayed in - Spotless clean, organized, fully stocked, comfortable beds, wonderful decor with fresh cut flowers and everything was labeled for our convenience. Chris had thought up of everything we would ever need for our stay and had it ready for us - even dog poop bags he provided for us! The home has wonderful large windows/skylights which provides a ton of light during the day and creates such a relaxing atmosphere. The loft is a lot of fun and very spacious and comfortable. The shower had great water pressure even better than my own home. Unfortunately, none of our party stayed in the Airstream but we peaked inside and it was awesome, has a heater hook up if needed as well! Wi-Fi was super fast and had great reception. The best part is he left us homemade cookies. You can tell he really prides himself on providing the best service and taking care of his home. I just have to say that Chris went above and beyond our expectations and we wanted to extend our trip because of this listing. Thank you Chris and your family!\\r\\n\\r\\n  LOVED staying here! Can\\'t wait to come back. Thank you so much :) Apartment was as listed. Slept all 6 of us comfortably. Within walking distance to about anything you would need. We had a great stay at Chris\\' place! The house is spacious, clean and light-filled, and centrally located in Ballard. We were in town for a friend\\'s wedding and it was the ideal home base -- close to the wedding reception venue and to many restaurants and cafés in Ballard. (Our favourite of which was hands down Café Besalu -- amazing croissants and pastries!)\\n\\nMy husband and I had fun staying in the airstream, which despite the unusually hot weather stayed nice and cool in the evening. There was even a space heater in case it got too cold, but we didn\\'t end up needing it. Our only comment is that it was slightly less private than we\\'d anticipated. There weren\\'t any curtains in the airstream and the backyard faces onto a visible alleyway, which is only separated by a low picket fence. This wasn\\'t a big deal for us since we were two people and the neighbourhood felt safe and quiet, but just thought we\\'d mention it.\\n\\nWe were five friends and would definitely recommend staying at Chris\\' if you\\'re a larger group. As the listing describes, there is only one bathroom, but Chris was very gracious and let us use the downstairs bathroom too, as the unit was unoccupied at the time.\\n\\nChris was very communicative and friendly, and we wouldn\\'t hesitate to recommend staying at his lovely home in Ballard! Loved this beautiful house in such a wonderful neighborhood! It was clean, comfy, and roomy, plus it had everything my family needed along with thoughtful little extras from coffee and snacks to toiletries. Soft, fluffy beds, a fun loft, and the Airstream trailer was more than enough room for my family of five. The central location was clean, safe, and perfect for having fun in Seattle and the whole family loved exploring Ballard. I don\\'t think I could have found two nicer hosts. I plan to stay there every time I need to be in Seattle! Great little house in a great little neighborhood (Ballard).  Tons of room for several people.  We didn\\'t even use the airstream for the three of us.  Chris was really friendly and accommodating.  Only difficulty was that there was only one bathroom.  Overall, a happy experience. We had a fun time staying at this house - it was great for a family. There was enough stuff in the kitchen for me to make coffee and pancakes for breakfast, and each of us got our own sleeping space - bedroom, loft, and living room. The one bathroom was off the bedroom but since we are family that didn\\'t bother me. Unfortunately we chickened out of sleeping in the Airstream- that would have been really cool! Chris was really nice and even offered to set up a pack and play for our son, which we didn\\'t end up needing since we brought our own travel bed.  This was my first experience using airbnb and it was great. We were really happy with the space and appreciated all the extra touches (such as fresh baked cookies, water and soda in the fridge) that Chris provided. The location was super convenient - you are just a couple of blocks from transit to downtown and you can also walk to a lot of restaurants and bars in Ballard. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Great location, great place with everything we needed for a comfortable and easy stay!  The home and hosts were incredible!  From the minute we walked in to the minute we left it felt like home. The small touches like snacks and coffee were great. The beds were amazingly soft and clean and we would have stayed for a week if we could have! Thank you Chris! We arrived quite late so it was a bit dark but using the flashlight app on the iPhone, we were able to punch the code in to gain access into the home. The interior of the home was similar to that of the airbnb site. However, the airstream looked different late at night and we chose to stay in the home. We emailed and had a friendly chat in person. We had an awesome stay!! We were a little worried about the stairs with our young daughter but there was a door that could be shut and locked which was helpful!! Chris was great to work with from the beginning, he even brought in a co sleeper for my daughter which was very thoughtful. The house is nice and had everything we needed. We would definitely come back if we\\'re ever in the area again. Thanks again! Chris was super sweet and really helped us settle in. He gave us lots of advice about the neighborhood, and was always around or available if we had questions. My husband, my dog and I were moving to Seattle and in the process of renting a place so it was a really nice welcoming place to land out the door. Would rent it again in a heart beat.  My husband and daughter traveled to Ballard for my nieces wedding. We came across this property and were interested because of the separate area outside with the airstream. My daughter and boyfriend stayed out there. Which gave us all more room and privacy. Chris our host was very accommodating and went out of his way to make our stay comfortable. We suggested he put in a full length mirror in. He went and bought one and had it for us when returned at the end of the day. The house was located to everything we needed. We really loved the area! Lots of restaurants and shopping close by. Took advantage of the Market a few blocks away on Sunday. It is also located just 10 min. by car to the Pike Place Market and Downtown. We will defiantly stay at Chris\\'s house again when we return to Seattle.  Although I never had the pleasure of meeting Chris, he went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcome even before we left for our trip to Seattle.  He stocked the house with snacks and bottled water and even baked cookies for us!  His house was lovely and in a beautiful neighborhood. I highly recommend staying at this beautiful home on your next trip to the Seattle area.  Thanks for a wonderful stay, Chris!  The host was very laid-back, which helped us to feel relaxed.  The yard, dog door, dog bed, food and water bowls worked great for our dog.  The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful, yet an easy walk to restaurants (highly recommend Kim Chee House on 24th), and to shopping.  The warm cookies were a nice touch, and we also appreciated the coffee, microwave, creamer, sugar, tea, bottled water, shampoo, etc.  There were a lot of nice extras in case we forgot anything.  The key code worked flawlessly.  No one else was staying in the building at the time, so it was quiet and private. Chris is terrific! He makes sure the place is neat and tidy before guests come and even left us some freshly baked cookies. You can imagine how happy we were when we checked in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place is just as the photos looked. I got really good vibes being in there. All the beds were extremely comfortable, and I love the fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. It really felt like being home away from home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location was great too, just several blocks away from Market street. All in all, I had a great experience staying here. Far away enough from downtown Seattle to where you\\'re away from the madness and in the middle of a amazing neighborhood surrounded by water and boats and beauty. The house was immaculate and personal and the hosts even made us cookies and had all the amenities we could ever need! The airstream in the back was adorable and everything was awesome. Wished we could\\'ve met them but unfortunately we only stayed in Seattle one night. I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat! Great host, friendly neighbourhood - had an amazing time. Really cute apartment, loved the trailer! Chris was supremely friendly and considerate as a host, very easy to get hold of and went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed. The place is a comfortable and quirky combination of house and airstream trailer, which rests in the backyard. Both were great. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks Chris!  Great place. Awesome host. We walked to Ballard in less than 5 mins. Super clean and funky. Great place for groups or bands. Easy check in great experience all together! Great place! It has a great old character feel with everything you need.  The location was great.  We could walk everywhere we wanted as Ballard is a great place to check out good food and great beer.  Chris was amazing and contacting me quickly and even sent updates the day off and even the day we left.  There was lots of space and the fenced back yard was great for our dogs.  Will definitely go back there! Thanks Chris! Chris was great at keeping us posted on when the place would be available and had cookies ready for when we arrived. He left lights on and notes around the house made it easy to know where things were. Easy access to Market St and Ballard farmers market.  Chris was a great host. We arrived to cookies on the stove and fresh flowers over the sink. All of his instructions were well thought out and easy to understand. The place was nice and cozy, unfortunately we were only there for one night so we didn\\'t have much time to enjoy it.  Chris was very nice when I spoke to him on the phone. Although we never saw him while we were at the property. The property is laid out a little odd. although we were warned in reviews ahead of time. The airstream is quite cold in the winter while the sleeping loft is very hot in the winter because all the heat rises to the top obviously. The location in Ballard is fantastic and we really enjoyed the neighborhood. We love Ballard and being in a central location was the icing on our trip! Chris is a great host. The space our family stayed in was clean and comfortable and everything functioned as it was supposed to. Chris communicated easily with us and even extended a generous Thanksgiving dinner invite. The place was exactly the same as described. the place is about 20 minutes drive from downtown and the neighbourhood is safe. It\\'s comfortable and I enjoyed my one night stay at his place. I wish I had more time at this apartment! Chris is such a nice man to talk to and will definitely recommend this place to all the people out there.  We arrived prematurely and unloaded our things. When we returned the unit was delightful. Unfortunately the LOX & shrimp and bacon pie we brought where associated with the previous tenant. There we some problems associated with the bathroom shower so we left early the next day without bathing. We loved the personal freedom offered by Chris who is a great guy. Chris\\'s place in Ballard was perfect. Close to everything, clean, cozy and comfortable. He even left us some cookies. Will definitely stay again on our next trip to Ballard. The place was exactly as pictured.  Nice, i liked it.  I was only there for one day and it was just me, so i didn\\'t use the loft or the airstream.  I would definitely stay there again.\\n\\nDidn\\'t cross paths with Chris, but he was responsive and polite when we did interact.  He sent the combo for the door and I could simply let myself in and out.  Overall great experience. We enjoyed our stay at Chris\\'s place. He had everything we needed. Only wish we could have stayed longer.  Well first is that Ballard is a great area to stay with so much great food. The house is older and a duplex with stairs. The place has all you need and Chris was super great to rent from. We came at Christmas and he had a tree for us and teddy bear for my son and chocolates for us. So nice. Plus it\\'s easy to park.  Enjoyed one night at the flat; great location for walking to Ballard shops and restaurants.  La Isla for great Puerto Rican dinner, Cafe Besalou for amazing pastries (closed Tues) or Fresh Flours for breakfast. Didn\\'t get around to using spacious kitchen but appreciated large windows & light throughout.  Chris was welcoming and responsive--a fine experience. Staying at the Ballard house was great! The home itself was one of the highlights of our trip. We weren\\'t able to meet the hosts, but they made sure we were comfortable with every amenity we would need, including snacks, drinks, and toiletries. The home was clean and in a great location—we are looking to move to Seattle and because of this experience are now looking in Ballard. The only downside is there is a lot of sleeping space but only one bathroom, which is attached to a bedroom. If you\\'re going with a group, be aware of that. Other than that, the hosts and home were both perfect.  Chris was an excellent host. He was always available! Thank you Chris for hosting all 6 of us :) the place was warm and cozy. We all loved it :) One of the best hosts who I never got to meet. There were everything you could possibly imagine, from towels to even razor blades. \\r\\nThe place was clean and cozy. The host was very communicative, polite and hospitable. \\r\\nI would absolutely recommend this place. Great communication with Chris! He was incredibly responsive and the unit was exactly as described. We didn\\'t get to utilize the Airstream but the next time we stay we will for sure. The little things like beverages, snacks and chocolates awaiting our arrival made this a very pleasant stay.  The location of the flat is great and I was very glad that I could cook for my boys. We enjoyed the staying.\\r\\nThe only thing was that 2 of the boys had to use a ladder to go to their bed but we took that as a play. I was in Seattle for a sibling reunion. The flat is a great location within walking distance to Ballard restaurants and bars. Chris is a great host who handles any questions or concerns with an immediate response. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe flat was clean and the layout with the airstream offered my siblings and I enough privacy not to get on each others nerves. The little extras of chocolates and drinks, and that it was stacked with pretty much everything you could possibly need made it all the more conducive for a wonderful stay. Will definitely book again when I\\'m back in Seattle! Chris was a great host, and even provided some delicious cake for us on our arrival!  The house was as described, and the neighborhood was friendly and felt very safe.  Everything was in good working order, the kitchen had plenty of cooking implements for our needs, and the beds were very comfortable.  This was a lovely place to stay! My girlfriend and I stayed one night here along with our 2 dogs. We had a great experience and would stay again. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house and location were great. There is only street parking, but we didn\\'t have a problem finding parking; there was always a spot open in front of the house. The house is very dog friendly with dog beds and bowls laid out. We loved that! It\\'s hard finding dog friendly places, so it was a treat. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bathroom is spacious, had plenty of toiletries in case you forgot anything, and the shower has nice water pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe slept in the downstairs bedroom. We peaked at the upstairs bedroom/loft, and it has a TV which is nice, and the bed looked comfy. We didn\\'t see inside the RV so we can\\'t comment on that. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy suggestion is to bring earplugs because there were a lot of odd noises going on in the house at night. I am not sure if it\\'s the heater or what, but there were little squeaks all night long. With earplugs you will be fine.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPros: location, cable TV in all the bedrooms, snacks and water stocked in the house (thanks for the chocolate, too!), dog friendly\\r\\n\\r\\nCons: noisy at night\\r\\n We had a great stay at the airstream retreat. There were 6 in our group so it was cozy but that made it even more fun. The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed for breakfasts, there were plenty of extra towels and linens, and Chris was kindly always available via text. We also appreciated the location, easy to find and short drive to downtown Seattle. It was a great trip! The place was exactly as described and was just what we needed. We were 4 adults and two teenagers and had enough room. Loved the airstream. Location of bathroom attached to bedroom reduces privacy but not a problem amongst family.  Great stay, clear instructions..would def stay here again :) I couldn\\'t imagine a better place to stay while visiting Seattle area. Perfect location!! I felt like I was in my own home. Chris showed us around the whole place when we got there. He also had a card and chocolates to welcome us! He even left a dog bed out for my furbaby! The pillows were so cozy and fluffy! The place was very clean and smelt wonderful! I will definitely be staying here again!!!! Chris\\'s place was perfect - exactly as described.  Great location - walkable to many points of interest.  Chris was available but not intrusive and we enjoyed staying here immensely.  The airstream was nice for a 3rd bedroom.  The loft was a very comfortable sleeping space as well.  We had a great time and will be back!! Absolutely perfect. Chris was there to greet us and made us feel right at home. The house was beautifully furnished and immensely comfortable. Literally hundreds of great restaurants and shops just two blocks away. The Bunkhouse should be on everyone\\'s list when visiting Seattle. Chris was a fantastic host, and the home and airstream were everything we had hoped they would be! Chris was always available and responsive: he checked in to see that we\\'d arrived, made sure that we were comfortable in the house, etc. The space was clean, comfortable, and stocked with every amenity we could have asked for, and it was all just a short walk from the heart of charming Ballard!  Great location, room for All and Chris is always available if needed -- though, you shouldnt be needing him because you are smack dab in the middle of everything to do Ballard. When we travel north to seattle we will forever check to see if the ballard bunkhouse is available!  Chris was an excellent host.  He responded quickly to my questions and made my visit comfortable and professional.  I booked the property specifically for the Airstream, but fell in love with the house as well.  The neighborhood was quiet and friendly.   I would definitely book this location again.  Chris made us feel right at home with a fun and friendly energy that anyone going into a new area looks for. We arrived early and he left us a really kind note later in the day. It was in a beautiful area and super close to downtown Ballard where we had a great dinner only a nice walk away. The airstream was comfy and gave us great rest. waking up with leaves around us and fresh air was sweet. I would recommend the place to anyone coming to enjoy the Seattle area. Thank you Chris! people and places like this are what makes airBnb so cool. The upper bunkhouse is great super cute airstream bedroom and lovely upper deck for wine at night. I loved staying here. I slept in the loft bedroom and the bed was wonderful. Thanks for everything Chris!!\\r\\n Cozy, amenities extensive, pet friendly, clean, a great host(!!!) and a perfect comfy neighborhood. Description is accurate and spot on notes throughout the home make it easy to enjoy every feature (like the loft skylights). We will definitely stay here again.  Chris was very sweet and friendly.  His response was prompt and he was always upbeat and kind, even when we had to cancel (very sick 18 year old dog).   Just from my dealings with Chris, I wouldn\\'t hesitate to re-book his place...and hopefully have the opportunity to actually enjoy it next time!   This place was awesome! Every detail was covered and he was super responsive. There were even some nice snacks to use. I\\'d highly recommend staying here Stayed here for a weekend with my parents and we loved it!  The house was very clean and inviting. Great location because it\\'s close to Market street, but you don\\'t get all the traffic noise.  I stayed in the airstream and slept like a champ.  You have to be a little creative to work around the bathroom location but we knew that going in. All in all, I would stay here again in a heartbeat.   Was a great location and perfect for our family and dog! This is a great upstairs apartment!  Very clean.  Well stocked with linens and cooking supplies.  Fresh flowers added extra charm. Owners were very helpful and communicative via email and text.  We stayed here overnight at the last minute and got a quick response to our request.   We had a great stay in Ballard at the Bunkhouse.  Chris was a terrific host, very responsive and accommodating throughout the process.  The Bunkhouse is an a very pretty area of Seattle--we took the the bus from 2 blocks away for our Seattle exploring and Ballard\\'s cute streets are a walk away.  The Bunkhouse was clean, well stocked with everything we needed, and comfortable for my family.  We even brought our dog, who loved the backyard and walking in the neighborhood.  We would stay there again for sure! Everything was great! The space worked out perfectly and I highly recommend this location to anyone. A very comfortable and laid back vibe and Chris was great. The host (Chris) was very accommodating and welcoming. The house was very clean and all the facilities we as described on the ad. There was a TV in every room of the house and the washer and dryer did a really good job on some clothes that had been stained accidentally. I loved that the front door had a code to get in so no one had to worry about keys. I stayed in the loft and it was very comfortable, just a little difficult getting back down from. The neighborhood is great, very quiet and close to downtown. Would stay here again.  The bunkhouse is one of the best airbnb\\'s we have stayed in.  Chris thinks of all the details that will make any stay more welcoming and comfortable. Communication was easy.  The beds are super comfortable and the apartment was well equipped.  We didn\\'t use the airstream but it looked very cozy.  The house is easy walking distance to all the great restaurants and shops in Ballard and an easy drive to downtown Seattle.  We highly recommend the bunkhouse.  This retreat is awesome! My wife and I, along with two friends stayed here and really enjoyed it. Chris is an amazing host, he made us feel really welcomed and was very responsive. The Airstream was surprisingly cozy, I\\'m a tall guy and didn\\'t feel at all cramped...\\r\\nThe area, Ballard, is beautiful. We would definitely recommend staying here!    Chris went above and beyond for us, I asked him if he has rice cooker,  he quickly one for us and even gave us the rice too. He stocked his fridge with water and sodas, on counter had snacks, every details meant that he wants his guests to be happy and we did. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe, we had no problem finding parking right in front of the house. The house is only minutes to everything. Chris was quick to respond, always friendly and personable. Couldn\\'t imagine a better host. The place was fun, clean and well located to enjoy all Ballard\\'s charm.  Chris was exceptional and very accommodating. Wonderful place, wonderfully kept. We\\'d definitely stay again  Chris was easy to work with and the house was perfect for our one night stay.  Chris is a great host and a good guy. The house is comfortable, well set up, and in a great neighborhood. Walking distance to Seattle\\'s bus rapid transit system and within a 1/2 mile of great places to eat/shop in Ballard. My family and I had all of the fun at Chris\\'s Ballard bunk house. The location was perfect and the house itself is adorable. I loved sleeping in the airstream and the bed was remarkably comfortable. Chris was a very nice host... Leaving us chocolate and snacks. The loft was cozy and perfect for my two little sisters. Also, allowing pets to stay is a great addition to an already wonderful little spot. Enjoyed my stay-cation with my family. Thanks so much, Chris!  The Bunkhouse was perfect for our Seattle trip.\\r\\nChris is a great host, super welcoming and great communication.\\r\\nWould like to stay again.\\r\\n\\r\\np.s. found a great happy hour / bbq spot down the street at Bitteroot :) Had tickets for a show in Ballard and we totally scored on finding this spot. Chris is a total dream to work with. He pays attention to every detail (snack basket was a huge hit!) and was friendly and thoughtful through every stage of our booking, stay, and departure. Comfy beds and linens, stocked kitchen, and amazing location. Will definitely stay again next time we\\'re back in Ballard. The airstream receipt/2 bdr house was awesome! Comfortably fit all 6 of us and we really enjoyed staying here. Chris had the fridge stocked with sodas and water and had snacks on the counter as well. Overall we felt very welcomed and happy with our stay and our host. The neighborhood was great and we were able to walk to local bars/restaurants easily. Thanks for everything, Chris! Chris\\' behind-the-scenes hospitality shined. His quick response time, the ease of the check in process, a kind note of welcome, the swiss chocolate left for us...all these left an impressionable mark on us. The living space is compact and perfect adequate for smaller groups. The airstream served as a nice treat for us since we had a party of 5. The back deck is a delightful place to watch the evening come (and you can see the space needle from it as well!).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drive to downtown Seattle took about 15 minutes, and there are wonderful restaurants in the the area (check out \"The Fat Hen\" for breakfast).  The unit that we rented was as advertised! It was nice, clean, and close to the action in Ballard!  Chris was so nice to leave us a note congratulating us on our wedding day. The airstream trailer was perfect for pictures of my beautiful wife as well. I can\\'t say enough good things about our experience. Thank you, Chris! Chris was one of our best Airbnb experiences yet! Very informative and beautiful home. Fun little labels throughout the house ensured that we knew where everything was. The loft was a blast and the airstream inspired us to look into building one of our own. Would definitely look to stay at the Ballard retreat again.  Perfect place and location. Wish I could stay longer. I always get nervous about pet-friendly places but this place was super clean and cozy. I\\'m glad I got to meet Chris because he was awesome too. Chris is great to work with.  Once you get used to the layout (which he was very upfront about), very cozy.  Clean, comfortable beds, great kitchen, neat little 2nd floor deck.  Very walkable to Ballard restaurants, grocery, etc. of which he left maps & information.  Airstream with history book was great. Nice to have parking.  The airstream retreat was wonderful. It was clean and well appointed in a great neighborhood.  My family and I were very comfortable there and we would highly recommend it to others.  Chris\\'s place was charming and in a fun neighborhood. It was very peaceful sleeping in the loft and my parents were happy in the bedroom. It was perfect for a quick trip and fun night  in Seattle.  Lovely place and great for a city break. Quirky and unusual, very safe and quiet. We loved attention to detail and emergency supplies of water drinks etc. Thank you so much Chris. Chris provided a wonderful experience for our bachelorette party in Ballard. The home was extremely clean and welcoming, including the AWESOME airstream trailer. He even left chocolate for the bride to be. I highly recommend staying here for a great Ballard experience!  This is a fantastic spot! So funky, comfortable and in a great neighbourhood - huge selection of quality bars and restaurants. \\r\\nThe place was stocked with goodies which is something I didn\\'t expect but a wonderful surprise. \\r\\nChris was timely with his responses and a pleasure to communicate with.\\r\\nHighly recommend this place to other visitors to the area. Chris was incredibly kind and responsive. The place was clean and perfect for a quick nights stay.  A unique listing with the Airstream trailer in the yard.  A perfect man cave which my husband used for napping and guitar practice.  Also fun for us both to hang out in to keep an eye on our pups in the yard.  Speaking of which, thank you Chris for allowing our little doggies to stay with us.  It makes our trip much more fun to have the whole \"family\" together. As to the apartment itself - it was just as described.  Very clean, with great attention to detail and  even a note from Chris and goodies in the kitchen to welcome us.  Chris was immediately available and a perfect host.  And it even has parking (tight but works )!  Considering the great Ballard location, available parking, pet friendly, lovely upstairs apartment with man cave and small yard for pups it was really almost an unbelievably good fit for our needs.  Bravo Chris - we hope to return soon! Chris was amazing and the house is awesome. We had a great time. \\n Chris was very accommodating and a great host. He took time to make us feel welcome in his home and was available by phone anytime. The house is full of character and history with a unique bonus of an Airstream trailer in the back yard. The house is equipped very nicely with everything you need. Very nice neighborhood and relatively close to the city centre by car. Thank you for the great experience, Chris! We all enjoyed our stay very much.   Great place - Great location - Great host!\\n\\nYou get to sleep in a vintage Airstream, and it\\'s super cool if you like rustic vintage Airstreams!\\n\\nBut if you really want a polished hotel room this one\\'s not for you.\\n\\nIn the second floor apartment part you get a nice upgraded kitchen, nice bath albeit only accessible through the  bedroom. \\n\\nLiving room is small but you didn\\'t come here to hang out in the house did you?\\n\\nAll in all a great place only minutes walking distance from Ballard ave. \\n\\nAnd Chris was responsive and forthcoming! \\n\\nRecommended!\\n We had an awesome experience at the bunkhouse!!  Thanks so much for the hospitality!! Wish we only had more time to enjoy it and the surrounding neighborhood.  Our flight was delayed so we unfortunately arrived later than planned.  Regardless, the accommodations and location were excellent.  Thanks for the water,  coffee and snacks waiting for us as well! Perfect after our 12 hour day of traveling.  Would love to stay here again and highly recommend it to others. Thanks again!!   Chris was great! The place was exactly like the pictures! Chris is extremely welcoming and helpful.  Chris\\'s place was awesome! The airstream is sweeeeet, and exactly as advertised.  Seattle is experiencing a historic heat wave, and to ensure we were comfortable, Chris installed AC units and brought a bunch of huge fans to make us more comfortable.   Great host, great place.   Our family stayed at Chris\\' on our way and back from an Alaska cruise. we felt welcome and cared for. His home and its location fit out needs. During that one heat wave day, Chris checked on us, replaced an air-conditioning unit for more cooling power and took us out to the Locks for a fun day and distraction from the heat. We are very thankful That was my 1st time staying at a Airbnb place. I loved it! The welcoming card and Toblerone were very appreciated. The  bedroom was super clean and everything you need is there.\\r\\nLove the location, near Market street and Ballard Ave.\\r\\nI will recommend to stay at this house, Chris was very welcoming.\\r\\nThank you, my mom and I had a fantastic time! wow! This turned out to be the perfect place for me and my family. Super huge, with room for two teen boys and mom and dad, a well-stocked kitchen, and a perfect location. We walked to the local parks ( the big one is amazing - we saw immature hawks in the trees, and played for an hour), walked to the bookstore in Ballard, and even walked to the salmon ladders/locks! Thanks to the warm and lovely Chris for greeting us, and giving us great ideas of places to go and eat. We can\\'t wait to come back!  The Airstream Retreat, a great place to securely store bikes, was perfect for our Friday night stay prior to departing early Saturday morning as we participated in the 200 mile STP bike ride to Portland.  The location provided an excellent selection of restaurants to choose from for dinner (highly recommend the Italian restaurant, Volterra) and also made for a short ride along the Burke-Gilman bike trail to the start line at the University of Washington.  Chris was a very gracious host making sure we had a place to park our Suburban for the night.  He also left us a very nice welcome card and a bowl for of snacks and goodies.  The Airstream is also pet friendly!  Staying at Chris\\' place was a breeze. Great location! We walked everywhere in Ballard. Bedding was clean and pillows were great.  Highly reccomend Staple and Fancy for dinner. I would definetly stay here again! Chris was a superb host. The rental was spotless and very comfortable.  We would go back in a heartbeat!\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you Sir.   Chris is a very thoughtful host . He leaves some beverage and snacks for us . The house is cozy and lovely . We will be back soon . Great place in great neighborhood, with tons of info about both the house and the area provided by host. Shower is AMAZING. Oh, and free waters, sodas and a Toblerone bar. This place was awesome. Chris was fantastic in accommodating our last-minute and quick overnight request. He was incredibly communicative and made himself available to answer any questions we had. Chris went above and beyond to provide recommendations, clear instructions, and a warm and welcoming environment for my family. We loved the location, listing, and overall experience at the Bunkhouse and will definitely keep it on our radar for return visits to Seattle!! Our host definitely made us feel welcome, with a nice personalized note, yummy snacks, helpful orientation to the neighborhood, restaurants and the house, etc.  House was just as advertised.  Beds were comfortable.  Everything worked.  Kitchen was nice (thanks for the coffee!).  No complaints whatsoever. Chris\\'s place is nice and very well equipped! You literally have everything you need! We did not use the outdoor camper, which provides an  extra bed, but I think it would be a great solution for a larger group! Chris is very responsive and kind! A great place for a reasonable price! The Ballard House is a lovely historic home in the up and coming Ballard district of Seattle. Chris has done a great job working to restore the home and it shows. The unit is clean and well presented with all the amenities you would need.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the loft, fold out bed, and main bedroom ... you can sleep 6 in just the house, plus 2 more in the Airstream retreat which is quaint and functional .. but nice for those that need more private space. There is only 1 bathroom, through the main room, so be sure to plan ahead when getting ready in the morning and evenings if staying with a large group.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is located in a great part of town close to grocery, transit, the Locks, museums and the very nice Ballard waterfront district.\\r\\n\\r\\nChris is very easy to stay in touch with and answered all of our questions as needed.  Chris provided a wonderful place for our getaway and first time using Airbnb.  I would recommend to anyone anytime for his listing of this property.  Thank you again Chris. Comfy space. Great area. Chris is a very good host. \\r\\n Bunkhouse and Airstream were a great stay experience. Chris has done an excellent job with keeping the entire place clean and well equipped. Very well thought out on anything we might need and taken care of already, very impressed. The small notes around the house were very useful.\\r\\nThe space itself was very comfortable and very home like. My 6 year old loved the loft.\\r\\nHats off for personal welcome card, candy and snack. Great place and great host. The good:\\nWell located, upstairs area was clean, well appointed and had all the necessary amenities including welcome snacks, drinks, guidebooks etc.\\n\\nChris was quick to fix things when they broke, including fixing the upstairs toilet when it broke\\n\\nBeds and linens were comfortable and clean\\n\\nThe not-so-good:\\nThe outside air stream was not fitted with a bathroom and kichenette as we had been told by chris it would be. We needed these amenities to be installed as a member of our party primarily uses a wheelchair. Chris did come over and install a toilet once we got there, but we ended up having to find alternative accommodation due to safety concerns. \\n\\nThat said in the middle of summer, in Seattle, with a group of 6, only 2 of which needing relocation, staying in the accommodation for the other 4 remained the cheapest option so they stayed.\\n\\nWithout the issues with accessibility this place would have been great. In the end though, poor communication and a lack of promised facilities caused a major headache for us.  We had a Nice time at Chris, everything was well plan an nice. We would certainly like too be there again.  Although stayed for only one night, I really enjoyed it. Especially the well stocked kitchen with free drinks and even Mac n Cheese! I really appreciated the little stickers throughout the house with instructions. Parking available in the back. Chris was very responsive to our needs. Would stay again! Great place to stay. Walking distance from 2 great breakfast places we tried. 3 comfortable bed. Chris was a great host. Would stay there again.  The house is small, but very lovely and sweet ness. Mr. Chris is a careful and kindness man. If you like cooking by yourself, you can do something in kitchen. It is important that the rooms and restroom are very clean. There are 5 people of us to live in the house. It\\'s not good for us that there is just one restroom. It\\'s not convenient for us to use it. If you are older traveller,It\\'s not fit to live the upper level room because of climbing the wood ladder. Even though, I think it\\'s worth to live in the house. It\\'s wonderful trip for my family. Wow! This experience was unbelievable. Chris provided a warm welcome note and stocked up the pantry and fridge with snacks and drinks. Everything was tidy and clean! Wish we could have stayed longer, though I will be visiting again soon!  Chris was a great host! He was always available to answer any question and made sure that our stay was comfertable and enjoyable! The accomadtion was excellent and the information regarding the area was extremely helpful! Would recommend to anyone! Great location, first class accommodation!  We arrived at the bunkhouse, easily got in using our code, and found a hand-written welcome card and cozy, spacious, adorable accommodations. I loved how Chris labeled instructions around the space (where light switches were, e.g.). There\\'s not only a comfortable bedroom, but a roomy loft, and, as a bonus, an Airstream with a bed and bath. Fabulous! And close to charming Ballard district.  A very nice house at suburb Seattle. VERY welcoming. Loved those helpful instruction labels everywhere in the house.\\nMy kids loved the loft space and a bed there, and I enjoyed private stay in the Airstream trailer :D\\nWould definitely come back. Thank you!  A group of guys rented this place to stay in town for a wedding. We had a great time and suited our needs perfectly. We appreciated the flexibility and little touches from Chris, like the snacks on the counter.  The Bunkhouse was a really great house with all the facilities you may need !\\nChris and Jenny are very kind people who do their best to make your stay really great !\\nThank you for everything ! Chris was very welcoming and accommodating host. And what a cozy, perfect little retreat this was! It was very walkable, cute, and had everything we needed for our 4 day stay in Seattle. We had a great time and would definitely recommend the bunkhouse if your travels take you to Seattle. We loved it! Listing was exactly as described. We received a nice welcome card and a toblerone. Kitchen is very clean. The bed in the main bedroom is very comfortable. Shower is wonderful with great pressure and nice soft towels. The house is stocked with everything you need and is decorated tastefully. The neighborhood is fabulous with many great shops and restaurants.  We had use of the Airstream, but did not use it so I cannot comment. We went in it and it was very cozy. The Keurig is a life saver and makes great coffee. Wifi great. Two thumbs way up! We loved being in the Ballard neighborhood.  Great walking area to wonderful places & fun things to do. The house is fabulous, unique and really warm and friendly.  Chris goes the extra mile to ensure your stay is perfect.  We felt like family.  Chris answered all my questions before hand and was so kind. Chris is super host status!   I had to book the Bunkhouse very last minute and Chris was more than willing to have the apartment ready after my long trip.  The Bunkhouse is even more charming in person.  It is clean, thoughtfully furnished and stalked with goodies to make your stay feel a little like home.  Chris\\' added details such as a \"History of the Bunkhouse\" book, welcome card, and so many other things truly make this a special place to stay. I would highly recommend Chris and the Bunkhouse! Thank you for extending your home to our crew! We had fun! We had a great experience staying in the Bunkhouse! It was clean, cozy, comfortable, easy to find, and fun. The neighborhood was lovely too. We\\'d definitely stay here again! Chris was a great host responding very timely to email and requests, usually within minutes.  He accommodated a last minute change to our itinerary without a problem.  When I told him we needed additional heat in the airstream, he responded with explaining how to warm it up, provided an extra heater, and supplied extra blankets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bunkhouse was accurately described in the Airbnb website, even having a sketch of the place showing all the rooms with size.  It is very close to Ballard\\'s Market St and many restaurants and bars but not so close that you are bothered by any noise or traffic.  The drive downtown was very reasonable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had 5 friends in our party but there was plenty of bed space.  The extra bathroom Chris is installing in the trailer will be very helpful for larger groups who require more privacy.  The downstairs residents were not ever noticed making you feel like you had the whole building to yourself.  It was a plus having the electronic key entry so we didn\\'t need to worry about having keys or misplacing them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will definitely consider the Bunkhouse when we visit Seattle again  Our experience at the bunkhouse was great! Group of 6 of us (three couples) did fine with the space and made use of the airstream. Chris checked in over the course of our stay to make sure we had everything we needed and provided a great breakfast recommendation within walking distance in the neighborhood. I would definitely recommend to others.  Chris welcomed us with a personal note, contact information in case we needed anything, fun history of his 100 plus year old home, sweet treats for the family and a nice welcome for our four legged companions too. Clean house, nice kitchen and bath, super comfy beds, everyone slept well. Hope to book a stay again in the near future. Who doesn\\'t love an airstream?! We made a last minute booking with Chris for 1 night, he replied promptly even though it was the evening. The house was great, clean and a friendly card to welcome us. There was only 3 of us but the house can easily accommodate 6. It\\'s like a home away from home and I\\'m sad that we were only there for a short while. We have friends that live in the neighbourhood, Ballard is a great place, and Chris\\'s house is an easy 5 minute walk to the main street where there is an abundance of cafes, shops, cinema and transport.\\r\\nThere was snacks and drinks left for us which was a lovely surprise and much enjoyed by my boys! \\r\\nI would recommend this house for it\\'s great host and location, if we had stayed longer I would have tried a night in the airstream.\\r\\nThank you Chris xx It was so nice to live in Chris house.The house is cozy and warm.Everywhere feels historical. Chris prepared many food and spices, especially Chinese spices. My friends and I felt like at home. The most important thing is the trailer\\'s dream came true. I\\'m so impressed. Both my friends and I felt warm and cozy living in Chris house. Such a quaint space, we love staying here. The Airstream trailer (where I slept) key was easy to find & it\\'s so adorable. Everything was well organized & clean. I had a great stay at the Bunkhouse, it was awesome.  Chris was very accommodating - I loved the clear tips and directions posted throughout the apartment.  Though I didn\\'t use the Airstream in the yard, I could see this as being a great option for families with kids who want a unique adventure.  Can\\'t thank The host enough for a pleasant stay! Great place! Very hospitable host, great location and neighborhood. We were a company of 5 and felt absolutely comfortable. Strongly recommend this place.  Ridiculously comfortable accommodations. Bed was like sleeping on a pat of butter. Very homey home and a welcome card was a friendly touch. Lovely set up that I would love to stay at again. Our host made us feel very welcome and the accommodations were as listed.  Great walking distance to downtown Ballard.  Enjoyed our stay and will be going back. Came into Seattle to see a show with some friends. It was the first time using airbnb and now we\\'re hooked. Chris has a great place. And for the evening it felt like our place. Cozy, comfortable, and would recommend it to everyone. We\\'re forward to staying again in the future. We stayed different house of Chris, Chris\\'s houses were nice,one  was  convenient to downtown of  Seattle,the other was easy to back Vancouver.Chris was  easy to conversation.I would look forward  to stay again if I have  chance. Excellent stay! Was a home away from home on a very busy business trip! Will be booking again in the future. This was definitely the best AirBnB I\\'ve stayed at.  It\\'s a fun little space especially with the Airstream in back.  It was the perfect space for my annual reunion of friends that live all over the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ballard neighborhood is a nice quiet place to stay in Seattle while still being close to a lot of excellent breweries and restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough we didn\\'t see Chris, he was extremely communicative and helped us with everything we needed.  He went above and beyond providing recommendations and helpful hints to make our stay the best.  He even recommended an excellent dive bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe listing description was very accurate.  I have the bad habit of missing one major detail when I book these things.  I didn\\'t realize that there was only one bathroom when I booked it but it was clearly there.  I seem to do that with every booking.  Thankfully Chris added the wet room to the airstream which helped make up for my oversight.  Like the listing says, definitely make sure your group is comfortable with each other.  If you are, it\\'s no problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I\\'m ever back in Seattle, I\\'m definitely going to check to see if Chris has availability first before checking anyone else. Chris\\' bunkhouse provided us with the perfect retreat close to home while our house was undergoing construction. Very prompt feedback, accommodations just as described, and amenities were great for the two of us plus our dog. Beds were very comfortable and nice to have some snacks available too upon arrival. Highly recommend!  Very welcoming and homey!  Lots of nice touches like cooking supplies and snacks to make your stay easy. Two nice grocery stores within walking distance. We loved mod pizza two blocks away. The house is quirky and very old but we loved it and felt at home.  Chris was most pleasant and relaxed.  He responded immediately after I booked and was at the house to greet us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe home is very old with lots of character!  Loved the snacks, the coffee, even cream in the fridge.  Yes, there was construction going on next door; that crew was friendly too.  It was great to have a little home in Ballard from which to explore.  The Land Yacht; how cool.  Great to have a real plumbed toilet.  Would love to see the shower after it is done! Our experience at this location was perfect! It had three different rooms, which added to the experience, that where accommodating to our needs. The airstream was where I stayed and even though it rained and was very cold, Chris had provided a heater for the airstream that made it worth our while. Thanks for letting us into your home!  I had a group of 4 people stay here for a long weekend, and it was perfect for our group.  We were able to easily walk to bars nearby and close enough to downtown.  The guy that stayed in the trailer lived it! Very nice house!  Chris hat uns spontan für eine dritte Nacht aufnehmen können und wir haben uns wie zu Hause gefühlt. Der Kühlschrank hatte Getränke und es waren Süßigkeiten in der Küche bereit gelegt. Auch der Wohnwagen war gemütlich. Alles war sauber und zur Klarheit beschriftet. Das Heizsystem funktionierte super, was bei Seattles eisigen Temperaturen überlebenswichtig war.\\r\\n\\r\\nChris spontaneously accepted us a third night in his apartment and we felt like home. The fridge contained free drinks and there were candies in the kitchen. The airstream was comfortable, too. Everything was clean and there were little captions for no misunderstandings. The heating system did its job, which we absolutely needed in the cold November temperatures of Seattle. We had a great time at the bunk house! The 6 of us had plenty of space in the cozy house.  This place was stellar. Absolutely top notch. I wish we could have taken a longer holiday. The next time I stay in Seattle this is the first place I\\'ll look to book. What an enchanting house (and Airstream!) I loved the bits of history included throughout ~~~\\r\\n\\r\\nWonderful stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Minneapolis,\\r\\nPatrick We had a wonderful stay! The home is very comfortable, inviting, and plenty of room. We appreciate you accommodating us on such short notice. Thank you again! We loved this place! The beds were extremely comfortable and the house was well stocked with coffee/drinks/snacks. Will definitely return on future visits to Ballard. Chris was super fast and responsive. We added a couple more guests to our reservation at the last minute and he was completely accommodating. The place was sparkling clean, cute and comfy, and had tons of sleeping spots. The location was awesome. We love the Ballard neighborhood, and Chris\\' place is right in the center of it. Would stay here again.  Awesome stay and Chris was a fabulous host. Very helpful and communication was as good as I\\'ve ever had on air bnb. He was able to help us adjust our reservation and was very prompt. Look forward to staying again. House had a lot of character and was stocked with everything we needed! Especially loved the snacks and soda because we were only there for a short time and saved us a trip to the store. Easy communication, overall great quick stay.\\r\\n Homey place with a professional twist. That\\'s exactly what I wrote in the guest book. \\n\\nChris was extremely friendly and helpful. He made sure that our check in was smooth and knew where to find the things we needed. He even had a T-shirt with the bunkhouse\\'s logo on it. Switches and cupboard were all labelled with simple instructions so we didn\\'t need to do much guesswork. Plenty of sunlight in the house with the windows. The loft was a nice place if you need more comfort and privacy. The airstream was also fun and comfortable. There\\'s a heater and fan in it that made it warm and cozy even on cold winter nights. The history of the place made it even more interesting. The location is just a short and straightforward drive from downtown Seattle. Plenty of shops nearby. \\n\\nIn short, simply great experience. The loft and Airstream were perfect for two couples. The location is fantastic...walking distance to all in Ballard. Highly recommend this rental. We had a great stay. This was our first time using AirB&B and it worked out perfectly. I give the owner, Chris, a lot of credit for making everything go so smoothly. His communication was clear and very organized. The house was great for our needs. The only thing I would mention is that the loft is finished and a great spot but its really meant for young set that can climb up and into the loft. It is not easy to get up there. We had six of us stay and that was a very full house. We used the Airstream which was a great option.  I\\'d love to have the whole house next time, not just the top floor. Bottom line, great location, good parking, great snacks and drinks provided by owner and comfortable beds. Really a good experience! Thanks Chris! Vera was a gracious and wonderfully splendid host and the apartment was absolutely superb. It had everything we wanted and then some. Plenty of room, lots of electrical outlets, wifi (so that I could conduct my business with folks back home), large refrigerator, washer/drier, king-size bed, 1-1/2 baths, on-site parking (a real bonus in Ballard where on-street parking is hard to find), large-screen TV, very comfortable and tasteful furniture. I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting the Seattle area.  A real gem. Vera was a fantastic host from start to finish. Vera greeted me upon my arrival and gave me the grand tour of the space. Super comfortable, and super convenient to the heart of Ballard. The king-size bed was super plush, making it hard to want to wake up. I seriously could have spent my entire vacation sleeping because it was so comfortable. There were 2 bathrooms, one full, and one half. The full bath was stocked with very plush towels, eco-friendly hair products, and a very powerful blow-dryer. Vera had so many sweet and personal touches throughout the apartment, including treats from Dahlia Bakery, some fresh fruit, and coffee. The apartment had all of the conveniences of a hotel, with the charm and comfort of home. I loved how the kitchen was fully stocked with cooking equipment, as there\\'s a QFC market down the street. Vera was also super gracious with her time, making herself available to answer local questions, and to help with the logistics of check-out. I highly recommend this listing to anyone visiting the Ballard area.  Vera\\'s place is great and she\\'s such a nice lady. I intend to stay next time I\\'m in Seattle. Also, great location in Ballard, where there is loads of quality restaurants.  Vera was a great host and the apartment was very spacious and set up to be very comfortable with nice little personal touches.  The location itself is great, walking distance of the QFC, restaurants, stores and, of course, the Ballard Locks.  Had a wonderful time staying here. Lovely place in Ballard. Totally fit the image of small but stylish town. Walkable distance to everything. I love a restaurant called toast, just few blocks away from Vera\\'s place. What\\'s more, Vera is truly a people person. She is so mega nice. \\n\\nIt was my 2nd time leisure visiting Seattle.  I went travel with my friend for celebrating my birthday. We took Amtrak for an unique experience. But somehow there is a huge delay due to the electric problem on train. And there were almost three hours later when we arrived in Ballard. She stayed awake for us though she gotta wake up early on the next day. She was patient and even order us a house tour. Besides, her welcome snack basket was really a great good addition to my birthday trip. We appreciated that a lot!\\n\\nAll in all, Vera\\'s place counts a nice spot to check out. It is part of Ballard culture. We highly recommend to people ready to visit Seattle. Transportation is quite convenient out there BTW. My wife and I recently visited our daughter and family in Seattle for a week. We decided to try AirBnB for the first time.  Lucky us, we choose to stay in Ballard at Vera\\'s wonderful apartment.  She met us on-time as promised and walked us through her beautiful unit. She took the time to make us feel very welcome.  Vera, is very outgoing and friendly.  The property far exceeded our expectation. Vera has thought of everything!  The apartment was spotless clean.  She even stocked up a few items to get us going (eggs, milk, coffee, water melon, oranges, apples, fresh coffee cake (yummy), gray salt chocolates, Greek yogurt...ect. We arrived in Seattle after an 18 day cruise and need to do some laundry. Vera\\'s apartment included an in unit washer and dryer!  The apartment is in a very safe and well kept neighborhood.  Outstanding location with off street private parking (big deal in Ballard).  The bed is king size and very comfortable. You can also walk to restaurants and coffee shops Overall outstanding five stars (we will be back).  We had a wonderful stay at Sweet Ballard. The apartment was very nicely appointed with attention to every detail with everything we needed and more! The apartment décor was so cute and some of the features we really appreciated were an off street parking space, 1.5 baths, microwave, washer & dryer, comfy bed and soft linens, a fridge stocked with coffee, eggs and milk and a lovely fruit basket with chocolates! How \"Sweet\". We could not have asked for a more welcoming Hostess. Thank you Vera! This was our first airbnb visit and it didn\\'t disappoint. The most important things to us when we stay away are: a comfortable and clean bed, great shower and a great location. At Vera\\'s place in her little neighborhood in Ballard we enjoyed all of that and more. Vera made us feel welcomed right from the start. Her apartment is cozy and spacious at the same time. The walkability to bus lines and the downtown area of Ballard, The Locks, and other tourist attractions made for a fun vacation. We only rented a car at the end of the trip to ride out to Rainier. (You can hop a bus to 3rd Ave Enterprise Rental and get one!) Also, at the start of out trip we landed at SeaTac and Light-Railed it and bused over. This was a great vacation spot. Thanks, Vera. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apt. was clean, bright, and very comfortable. We could not have stayed anywhere more comfortable. And Vera was a delightful host. Although we never needed to contact her for anything, we knew she was always available.  I highly recommend this place. Awesome location and exactly, if not better than pictured.  Little touches make this place your home away from home.  Vera could not be more helpful, and totally respects your privacy. Highly recommend, We will visit again. The Ballard neighborhood in Seattle is like a small town in a big city. Everyone, especially our host, Vera, was so helpful and friendly. With Vera\\'s listing we got way more than we expected. Not only was she helpful above and beyond what we were promised, she came to our rescue more than once! I can\\'t recommend this impeccable sweet spacious home any higher! Our experience was totally positive.  Vera is a wonderful host and the apartment was perfect for us.  Convenient to all areas of Ballard, and especially to our daughter, who lives nearby.  We certainly hope Vera\\'s apartment will be available when we return to Seattle in a few months! After having numerous Airbnb experiences on three continents I rate Vera\\'s Ballard Apartment as one of the best.  Vera is a warm and generous person whose attention to detail and comfort is evident in her basement apartment.  She was attentive but not intrusive and we especially appreciated her promptly fixing our tv problem.  The beautiful fresh flowers and generous basket of breakfast/snack goodies were special touches.  Vera\\'s airy, light and spotlessly clean apartment is tastefully furnished with a comfortable bed, small but powerful shower, washer/dryer and fully furnished kitchen.  Light sleepers will be in heaven when the  blinds are closed as it is eerily quiet - perfect sleeping conditions.  Ballard has many good restaurants and bars and Vera\\'s is in walking distance to several.  An added plus is the bike/running trail, botanical gardens and Chittenden Locks which are only a couple of blocks away.  We enjoyed our stay at Vera\\'s and recommend her place without hesitation.    Sweet Ballard was a wonderful \"home from home\" whilst visiting our son. Vera was a tremendous host- so welcoming and helpful, but also she respected our privacy. She provided us with a welcome basket with lots of goodies and filled the fridge with food for breakfast. The apartment is beatifully furnished and well equipped. The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom spotlessly clean with plenty of soft fluffy towels provided. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking a meal and even has a dishwasher. The location is on a quiet residential street, within easy walking distance of the centre of Ballard ( lots of dining options, great Sunday farmers market and you can catch buses downtown) and the famous locks ( watch the boating, the salmon leaping up the fish ladder, listen to the band at weekends)- also close to Ray\\'s fish restaurant and Golden gardens beach. It was our first AirBnB experience- and one which will be hard to beat! We really enjoyed our stay at the Ballard apartment! Vera was incredibly welcoming and made sure we were comfortable. She was more than willing to answer any questions we had about the neighborhood. It was easy to get to various Seattle sites via the bus. The apartment was perfect and was exactly as described. It was an awesome first experience with airbnb! Would recommended this apartment to anyone traveling to the Seattle area!  Love love love this place, Vera was an amazing host.  Highly recommended.  Thank you Vera! Vera was a wonderful hostess and her apartment was perfect. Very clean, cozy and comfortable. Even better than I expected. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Vera was a great host! I had rented her apartment for my parents while they were visiting over the thanksgiving break, and it could not have been a better experience. Vera\\'s place had plenty of space for my parents to stretch out their legs, but it was still nice and cozy during the freak snow dusting we got over the holiday weekend. Vera was always super responsive via email or text whenever we had any questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are looking for a great Ballard/Sunset Hill location near the Locks, I can\\'t recommend Vera\\'s apartment highly enough!\\r\\n We had a wonderful stay at the Sweet Ballard Apartment.  The apartment is large and accommodating. It was spotless and well stocked with amenities.  Vera was a wonderful host.  She attends to every detail in the preparation of the apartment. And she left us a really remarkable welcome basket with snacks and fruit, as well as refreshments in the refrigerator.   Vera was also respectfully attentive. She made sure we had everything we needed for our stay.  And she is just a genuinely nice person, which made our stay all the more comfortable.  \\r\\n     The apartment has a bedroom and master bath on one side and a living space, kitchen and half bath on the other.  It was very well-suited for our needs allowing for activity and/or sleep as desired. It is conveniently located near many interesting attractions and only a few blocks from downtown Ballard restaurants and shops. We couldn\\'t have been more pleased. This will be our first pick for places to stay when visiting Ballard. Sweet Ballard was a fantastic experience. From the designated parking space to the incredibly comfortable king-sized bed, only fabulous describes our visit. Vera is a responsible, generous host who stocked the fridge with fruit, yogurt, milk and fresh juice. When we returned from having been drenched by Seattle rain, it was a joy to put our pants in the dryer!! The couch was a cozy place to read, and the extra half-bath was a bonus. The only thing missing was a pug! Vera responded almost immediately to questions we emailed. We loved the keyless entry. I appreciated how clean the apartment was and how much thought and energy went toward making sure we had everything needed to wash clothes, store leftovers, cook, be warm, be cool, relax. We will definitely stay here when we return to Ballard.  My brother was so pleased with his stay at your lovely apartment.  It was his first Airbnb experience and he said that he and his wife will surely use it again in their travels. Vera was the most welcoming and caring person I have met so far in my travels. She was extremely attentive to my needs and even left a welcome goodies basket for me when I arrived. She made sure I got in okay, had everything I needed, and was just the most pleasant woman. \\r\\nVera\\'s place was exactly what I wanted. It was spacious and full of amenities. I met with Vera the day after I landed and she showed me where everything was located, which made for a very convenient stay. The place was stocked with different-sized pots/pans, dishes, utensils, coffee pot AND filters, paper products, etc. She also told me what neighborhood restaurants were good and the best time of day to go (to avoid long lines). \\r\\nAfter learning that I was considering moving to Seattle, Vera went out of her way to answer neighborhood/city questions, alert me to the housing availability/changes, etc. \\r\\nI think the wildly popular success  of airbnb is based primarily on hostesses like Vera. Without her, the home would have been very nice, but the stay was made fabulous by her attention to details, willingness to go the extra mile, and overall sweetness.  We absolutely loved staying here!  The apartment really is sweet, and the neighborhood is really nice.  Quiet, but very close to a bus stop that takes you to pretty much everything.  Vera was a wonderful host -- she was great to talk to, and she had a bunch of goodies waiting for us when we arrived, which we thoroughly enjoyed.  The place itself was perfect.  This was our first airbnb experience, and we can only hope that others will live up to this one.   It was a pleasure to stay at Vera\\'s apartment.  Very comfortable, clean and so nicely decorated.  We will surely want to return. Our stay at Vera\\'s was wonderful! The first impression on walking in the door was very \"home-like\" and comfortable. The place was clean and had all the accommodations that our home has like kitchen ware, technologies, laundry services and more. \\n\\nVera had out favorite fruits and snacks available to us, it\\'s like she knew us. Great place! \\n\\nWe took half of our meals in our temporary home and enjoyed the NW foods fresh from the Ballard Farmers Market and Pikes Market. We walked all over Ballard, lots to do and see. We used public transportation that was readily available. Walking along the water front was an every morning event, beautiful! I called and asked Vera a couple of questions and she answered immediately and I managed to lock myself out and Vera was right there! Very kind and fun host. We have gladly pledged to give up our usual stay downtown at the hotel and have a new ( temporary) home at Vera\\'s! The bed was amazingly comfortable.  We had a fantastic stay at Vera\\'s place. Check in was smooth, thanks to her detailed instructions. The apartment was beautiful, clean and welcoming. She even left a goodies for breakfast and snacks - amazing! Vera was a good communicator and always responded promptly to any enquiries. The location in Ballard could not be better, quiet, convenient to lots of restaurants and transport yet just removed from the busy main road for a peaceful night. Thanks! Excellent place to stay.  Walkable location, very clean. The space is well organized and everything amenity we could have wanted was readily available.  Also, the space has a dedicated and very accessible parking space which is very important for the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nVera was very responsive to questions during our stay. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again; the apartment is lovely, clean and quite well-appointed.  The pictures don\\'t do it justice.  And there are two bathrooms, which was a nice bonus.  The location was very convenient to everything we wanted to do downtown Seattle and points North. The only improvement I could have wished for is a thermostat so that we could control the temperature in the apartment ourselves (having lived in Arizona for the past 2 years we are no longer acclimated to the Pacific North West temps!) but Vera was great about cranking up the heat when we asked and she also provided a space heater which helped keep us cozy. Vera is a terrific host and she was very responsive to our needs.  And the gourmet treats she provided were above and beyond our expectations; I have stayed at many airbnb locations and this was definitely one of the nicest experiences I\\'ve had. First of all, Vera is a very kind and helpful host! She provides not only the apartment with perfect condition, but also much more help than I expected. She always asked me about what I need, made a list of nearby sceneries and facilities for me as a tourist, and even reminded me to park at a right place. =)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment itself is also great! Rooms are super clean, as well as the washrooms. Coaches and the bed is pretty comfortable. Network and TV worked good too. And you can find basically any ware and supplies there if you wanna cook something.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, the location is wonderful, right besides a beautiful park(a lock) where you can spend your nightfall at, surrounding by several good bars and cafes. The Ballard community is quiet and peaceful. To me, it is definitely the first choice of place to stay if I visit Seattle again in the future. My wife and I stayed here for a full month at the beginning of the summer.  Vera met us when we arrived and showed us around, described the neighborhood, and gave us suggestions as to where to eat.  Vera had stocked the kitchen with a variety of foods so we didn\\'t have to rush right out to grocery store.  Her selection was excellent and we enjoyed everything she bought.  The apartment is very nice and spacious (especially for Seattle), well decorated and had benefits you don\\'t often find in the area.  The bed is king size and was very comfortable.  I especially liked having the extra half bathroom, as this enabled my wife and I to get ready simultaneously and not fight over bathroom space or timing.  As an early riser, I was able to be in the kitchen, living room and extra bathroom and let her sleep without disruption.  The kitchen was well equipped and had everything you would need for cooking any meals.  The apartment was also equipped with a flat screen TV, full HD cable TV service, a DVR, internet, and a clothes washer and dryer.  The apartment comes with a dedicated parking space, which is a huge benefit in Ballard, as most people have to park on the street.  If we needed anything, we could send a message to Vera and would get an almost instant reply from her.  Vera was very diligent about making sure we had what we needed and were happy with the apartment.  In the middle of our stay, she had her cleaning lady come in and do a thorough cleaning.  It was easy to walk into the village where there are a large number of eating places.  The Ballard Locks are a very short walk, and it was fun to go over and watch the boats go through the locks.  Overall, I would highly recommend this apartment.  You have everything needed for a comfortable stay and a host who cares about the quality, her patrons\\' comfort, and is responsive to their needs.   Vera was an excellent host, and accommodated some of our special needs. Communication, check-in, and check-out were easy. The place is exactly as advertised with some nice perks like a washer/dryer, fresh fruit and snacks, and parking in front. It\\'s in walking distance to the Ballard Locks and salmon stairs. It\\'s also a little further walk or short drive to the bustling part of Ballard where there are a bunch of cool boutiques, restaurants, and hip bars. We felt really safe in the neighborhood and enjoyed spending a lot of time around it. This was a really comfortable and nice place! Vera was prepared and available and left a nice little spread of coffee and light breakfast options. I loved this place and would definitely stay here again.  We had an excellent stay while visiting our son and grandson in Ballard.  We arrived a bit early and Vera was there to greet us.  The apartment is very clean and cozy.  Comfortable king size bed and loved the convenience of bath and 1/2.  Quiet, residential location, just a few blocks to the locks and to downtown. Vera offers nothing more than perfection.  She is the ultimate AirBnB hostess providing many goodies, a beautifully presented apartment that was incredibly clean and tidy and her personal touch was beyond compare.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunication could not have been faster with instant response to any questions we raised.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment is in a lovely residential neighbourhood that is not far from the city but wonderfully peaceful.  Restaurants galore are within easy walking distance, just wish we could have stayed longer to try them out.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bed is really comfortable and a restful nights sleep was very easy to come by.  The kitchen provided everything needed to cook breakfast, lunch or dinner, as well any baked items, though Vera left so many goodies we didn\\'t need to do much of this!\\r\\n\\r\\nCannot recommend Vera\\'s place more highly and we can\\'t wait to return. This Sweet Ballard Apartment is great! More than enough room, very clean and cheery, comfortable and quiet. Within walking distance to all fun shops in quaint Ballard. Vera is on top of it for arrivals and departures so that happens without a hitch . A highly coveted parking space is provided right at your front door. A welcome basket is at the ready on the kitchen counter! Visitors have all the conveniences of home but you\\'re on vacation...highly recommended! Thank you Vera for a great stay in Seattle. Could not have asked for a better first Air BnB experience. The snack basket was awesome, nice and clean place, and great  location! Thanks? Vera made us feel very welcome in her lovely B&B.  It was everything we were expecting and we would love to return again if ever in Seattle.  The neighbourhood is attractive and safe and there are great shops and cafe\\'s within 15 minutes walk.  A stroll down to the locks and shoreline are well worth doing. A ride with Uber will have you in the central city within 15 minutes (traffic depending) for a cost of about $15. We loved returning to the tranquillity of Sweet Ballard after time in the city. We are return guests because staying here is a pleasure.  This apartment is clean, very comfortable and so nicely decorated.  The \"welcome basket\" of fruit and other goodies is much appreciated. Very complete, clean, and comfortable apartment with its own parking spot! Came with delicious snacks, including coffee and milk, and delicious small breakfast items. It was a lovely, private, relaxing experience for our vacation. Obviously well cared for and very (VERY) clean. Washer and dry was an added bonus as we were in mid-vacation, as well as an additional 1/2 bath. Lovely kitchen. Cozy feeling, but not in the small sense!  Vera\\'s apartment was perfect for our Seattle trip. Ballard is a wonderful area for both day and night life, with great local coffee and food! We were able to use the metro transit to travel around to other areas and attractions easily within about 20 minutes so we didn\\'t have to rent a car. Overall, we couldn\\'t have been more pleased with the personal touches Vera added and the convenience of having such a well equipped apartment. This apartment in Ballard is quite spacious and in a great location.  You\\'re within walking distance to the downtown restaurant scene and transit options if you wish to go further.  It\\'s a 20 or 30 minute bus ride to downtown Seattle, depending on which bus you take.\\r\\nVera had stocked the kitchen with a large plate of fresh fruit, plus fresh coffee, tea and snacks. The apartment also has it\\'s own parking space, which was a real plus since the neighborhood street parking is very tight.  We would definitely stay with Vera again, if again in Ballard.   This is a great BNB location! It is close to many restaurants (just a few blocks walk) and is a large space for 2 people. There is a large bedroom, 1.5 bathrooms, small kitchen and nice living area. We had a great time staying here. We arrived the first day to a basket of goodies and a few items in the fridge for us to snack on or eat for breakfast. What a nice surprise! :) Vera sent me the code for the door well before my arrival so that there was no confusion as to how my husband and I would enter the apartment. She even reserves the parking space in front of the apartment for you! This is a great place to stay for your Seattle visit. It\\'s a really fun neighborhood and (with the parking space) is a conveniently short drive to many Seattle attractions. Vera also has a list of nearby restaurants and things to do which provide great suggestions on where to eat in the area.  We couldn\\'t have found  a lovelier and more unique apartment in a great neighborhood in Seattle.  Vera was always there if needed, but stayed quietly in the background. She always answered emails/texts with in minutes, but we never actually met. We would love to return to the the Sweet Ballard Apartment  in the future.  The place was very clean, comfortable, with many thoughtful and special treats left for our enjoyment..  The Ballard neighborhood has much to delight everyone in such close walking  proximity to restaurants, sights, stores, and more. We recommend it highly. What a perfect place to stay! Vera has considered ever detail to make her listing an extraordinary place to call home for a few days. The space is huge and spotless with everything that you need to be comfortable. Super cozy bedroom and bed and a kitchen and fridge packed with snacks. I felt spoiled and totally loved it! Highly recommend. This is our favorite of all the Airbnb\\'s we\\'ve visited.  Vera is a wonderful host who makes us feel welcome.  The apartment is lovely, and so comfortable.  She is very thoughtful and the basket of \"goodies\" is much appreciated after a very long flight.      As last time, Vera was just plain awesome. From the welcome basket of goodies to the great shape of the home to her willingness to answer any of my questions/concerns, you cannot ask for a better hostess. Vera is more accommodating than family but she is warm and caring like family. Upon my leaving, I met one of her neighbors who confirmed what I have known: Vera is a great person. A great person with a great home.  My girlfriend and I had a great stay at Vera\\'s apartment during a 4-day vacation to Seattle. The apartment is very nice and comfortable. We were particularly impressed by how spacious and well-equipped it is. The location is excellent, too. It\\'s just a short walk to downtown Ballard, where there are lots of great restaurants and shops. It\\'s also just a short walk to public transportation, including buses to and from downtown Seattle, which were convenient and easy to use. A longer walk from the apartment takes you through pretty neighborhoods and along scenic coastlines. The whole experience was very smooth, and Vera was very accommodating. This was our first airbnb experience and Sweet Ballard (Vera) set the bar! We arrived very late to find Vera had a welcoming basket filled with goodies not only for breakfast but snacks and more. The apt. was clean and tastefully decorated, even nicer then the photos show. It has a floor plan for 2 people to feel very comfortable in. We were visiting Ballard for our first time and it was central to everything. The communication with Vera was excellent for questions regarding anything. We had difficulty with light switches and Vera responded immediately. Our 1 week stay flew by and we look forward to our future return! We enjoyed our stay in Ballard Victorian very much. It was such a nice place to stay, spacoius and well equipped. We spent a week visting our daughter who lives in a small apartment just around the corner, and it was so nice to be able to invite her and her family to dinner etc. We really hope to stay here agian next time we come to Seattle. What a PERFECT little spot! Ballard is such a charming pard of Seattle, and this home is everything you hope it would be- absolutely adorable, very walkable, and reasonably priced! We LOVED staying here, and will stay again in the future! Paula was flexible, responsive, and very accommodating. We didn\\'t get a chance to meet, but she was always available if we needed anything. Paula had a very organized binder with instructions, list of things to do, and tips for the place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe condo was very clean and comfortable. We were provided with lots of soft towels and comfy sheets for the bed. Although her condo is by a busier road, we never noticed. It felt extremely quiet, and relaxing with a nice view of surrounding area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kitchen was well equipped for a chef, toys are available for the little ones, and the 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms offers a lot of space. We particularly enjoyed the comfy corner \"nook\" kitchen table - it was a great spot to enjoy the view, feel the breeze on your face, and have your breakfast. We can\\'t wait to stay here again next time we\\'re in Seattle! My experience with Paula was pleasant. She is very organized and available for anything that I needed. She left a book on the counter that gave me ideas for things to do, local grocery stores and local coffee shops. Very helpful. The apartment was exactly as the pictures showed and Ballard is a wonderful town to visit. Great farmers market on Sundays is a must.  My experience was very easy and felt like home.  Paula put towels in each bathroom so I didn\\'t have to go on a hunt for these items. I have non complaints.   Paula\\'s description of her condo is spot on, beautiful, comfy and very well equiped with everything you need, especially in the kitchen. But seriously, don\\'t plan on cooking much as there are so many great places to eat close by! The condo is about a 2 min walk from Cafe Besalu which is worth staying here for that reason alone, their pastries will put most Parisan Bakers to shame. Mornings were spent sipping coffee and trying to make out the majestic form of Mt Rainier through the morning mist. Ballard is a great location lots to do close by, or if you are feeling more adventurous bus or drive into downtown. We would gladly stay at Paula\\'s place again on any future trips. Thank you Paula!\\r\\n We were welcomed by our host Paula who was absolutely fantastic! Listing was completely accurate. We only saw Paula for a few minutes to get the key, but she made herself very available to us if we needed anything. Paula had a great binder with local information and recommendations in it which was really helpful. Location is in the heart of Ballard we were able to wake up and walk to grab delicious trendy breakfast knowing that the Sunday market and Golden Gardens park were close by if we wanted to go on an adventure. Apartment was clean and temperature was perfect despite the warm summer day.  Paula--we will be back!!!!! Thank you!!!  Pictures were exactly as the apartment was. Great location, wonderfully equipped. Home away from home!\\r\\nPaula was available at all times and even stopped by in person to check if we had everything we needed. First off the space is very nice and exactly as it appears in the listing. The location is also very convenient and although it\\'s on a fairly busy street we didn\\'t find the noise to be disruptive. Easy to get downtown by transit and loads of places to eat and drink within walking distance in the Ballard area. We had four people and found the apartment to be spacious and well appointed. We had a few communication breakdowns during confirmation and check-in but Paula was very apologetic and sincere. We didn\\'t get to actually meet face to face but everything was as described. We found it a bit strange that we were charged a cleaning fee but also asked to strip linens from beds, sweep, empty garbages, etc. Not a deal breaker whatsoever, but something to keep in mind. Overall we were satisfied with our stay. This was our first airbnb experience and we were most satisfied. We found the property’s description and photos accurate. It was well-appointed, very clean with an appealing decor. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen was well-stocked with needed utensils, dishes and appliances. The location’s views were most enjoyable and we spent sunny moments on the small deck, enjoying the city. There were no surprises and the unit filled our needs well.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaula was very responsive to our inquiry and timely in follow-up as we arranged our stay. Prior to arrival, she provided contact information, directions and information to smooth our travel.  The communication with Paula was excellent before, during and after our visit. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location offered plenty of eating options within walking distance. Other attractions were either a short-drive or longer walk, including Market Avenue shops, Farmer’s Market and Ballard Locks. The unit is on a busier street, but when windows were closed, there was very little street noise (open windows offered a lovely cross-breeze). Paula provided a binder with useful information about the area, including some very good recommendations. She was available to answer questions as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would return to the property again and would enthusiastically recommend it to others. First let me say that the description of this accommodation was on the money.  The place looked just like the photos. The apartment was clean and complete with everything we needed.  We appreciated being provided with information about the area such as restaurants, places to go and transportation.  This apartment worked very well for myself and my husband and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in this area.  Paula provided a very lovely place for us to stay and only sorry we did not get a chance to meet her. As we do plan to return to the area, we would like to stay here again. Tim and I came to Seattle on a special trip for his birthday. We loved staying at Paula\\'s place in Ballard. It was within walking distance of all the great pubs and restaurants the Ballard neighborhood has to offer. The condo itself is very quiet and we liked the fact that Paula\\'s family live in the building so there was always someone close by if we had any questions. The condo does indeed have a fantastic view of Mount Rainier and downtown Ballard. Though it is very nicely decorated, it is not \"overdone\" so it was very comfortable and we instantly felt right at home. Next time we come to Seattle, we are definitely staying here again if it is not booked! We had a great and easy experience at Paula\\'s. The apartment was very tidy and very comfortable. The location was perfect. Everything in Ballard just a few steps away.  If I return to Seattle I will definitely rent from Paula again. Her apartment was a very good value. Love the apartment and location. 5 minute walk to the Ballard downtown area. Thanks so much Paula for the use if your place!  Everything was lovely, including great bedding and towels!  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Host Paula greeted was warmly and made us feel at home! Everything we needed was there...including great neighborhood recommendations! Ballard has easy access to everything, when you don\\'t want to stay in the middle of everything, and quite a few local gems. We were greeted by Paula\\'s mom Laura, as Paula was out of town that weekend. She showed us to the condo and gave us a quick tour giving us everything we needed to know. The unit was just as described. We had a beautiful view of Mt. Rainier. There was plenty of room for the four of us to hang out when we were not running around Seattle. The decorations were in the apartment are wonderful. The beds are comfortable and so is the sofa. We had a great time here. The location was perfect. It is close to downtown Ballard and downtown Seattle. Thanks for making your home available to us! We loved our stay at this condo. It is in the wonderful Ballard District, with lots of neat places within walking distance. Our family stayed here for Thanksgiving and everything we needed was in the kitchen to cook a complete traditional Thanksgiving dinner. Paula was excellent at communicating with us, and checked in with us several times during our stay. She is a gracious, kind host and that is reflected in her condo\\'s furnishing and feel. Her condo has nice touches such as a great supply of DVDs, books, and even a piano! We will definitely try to stay here again the next time we visit Seattle. Paula\\'s condo is great!  The space is clean, well-maintained, and enjoyable to be in.  The neighborhood has a ton of great spots for coffee and food.  We had a car and it was really easy to find parking right in front of the condo and get around the city from Ballard. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting Seattle and would love to come back and stay again. Paula\\'s place was an absolute dream! The condo was perfect for what we our weekend getaway with our in-laws. \\r\\n\\r\\n+ Condo +\\r\\nThe condo itself is well organized and has everything you could possibly need with a fully stocked kitchen, cozy living room, and comfortable beds. We had a little trouble with the heater and Paula\\'s mother was just down the hall and stopped by within minutes to fix the issue. Although we didn\\'t have kids with us, this place would be perfect for a family with small children as well!\\r\\n\\r\\n+ Location +\\r\\nIt was close to the city and in beautiful Ballard where we could walk to the Sunday farmers market, delicious restaurants, vintage shops, and the Ballard locks, among other attractions. We did have a car which was easy to park at her place and found it very accessible to the rest of the city. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'ll definitely be back! Just spent three nights in Paula\\'s light and airy apartment in the Ballard district.  The well-equipped kitchen is a big plus, as are the views of Mount Rainier and the Olympics.  Paula was out of town but her mother kindly met us on arrival and gave us tips on the neighborhood.  If you like french pastries, Cafe Besalu down the street is an absolute must!  Paula was a wonderful hostess. The condo was clean and comfortable, and I loved the neighborhood. Parking was easy but we were walking distance from coffee shops, restaurants, and stores. I appreciated that Paula left us a book with recommendations and other information. We received a warm welcome and had a nice tour of the condo before having an opportunity to settle in.  The condo was just as depicted in the photos.  Previous reviews accurately depicted the place.  My husband and I loved the view  and especially enjoyed the mornings and evenings in this inviting condo. Travelling to Paula\\'s place was easy. With a bus stop right outside it was straightforward to find and get into the apartment. Once checked in, the apartment was very clean and well looked after. Lots of clean towels, a comfy bed, plus a nice light bright living kitchen area - lots of home comforts including an iPod dock made Paula\\'s apartment very homely and great to stay in.\\n\\nBallard is also a really fantastic area - the apartment is just a few blocks up from loads of restaurants, bars, shops etc.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t directly meet Paula but she made it clear she was close by if we needed anything.  Beautiful home with rustic feel.  We could see ourselves living there.  The bed was very comfortable with great sheets.  Paula had a Pack \\'n Play crib with clean sheets and blankets available in the second bedroom for the baby.  Elevator was very helpful for bringing up luggage and the baby.  A view of the Seattle skyline is visible in the distance and we could see the 4th of July fireworks from the apartment.  Walking distance to some great restaurants and a supermarket.  Street noise can easily be heard but was not a major problem for us.  There is no microwave if you need it. The  beautiful Ballard condo was everything we could have wanted. Great neighborhood and easy parking. Everything  was within walking distance and we were right on a bus line. The condo was clean and equipped with everything we would need. Paula was a great hostess and available to answer any questions. I would love to stay there again on our next trip to Seattle! Really great apartment with comfy beds and great views. She had so many kitchen supplies! We even made food from one of the recipe books. There was a lot of information about things to do in the Ballard area and Seattle to help us make a really great trip! We had a really wonderful time at Paula\\'s apartment. Paula was extremely accommodating and we had some wonderful experiences and meals around Ballard and Seattle thanks to her recommendations. The apartment was very conveniently located with bus stops to the downtown area on the doorstep. We really enjoyed exploring the neighbourhood and the apartment had all the comforts and facilities to make our stay relaxing and enjoyable. If you are in the Seattle area we recommend this as a wonderful place to stay. Paula made us feel right at home. There was Starbucks coffee and tea available and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to cook a few meals. Paula left a binder full of info (things to do,restaurants,etc.)\\r\\nWe really thought the location was very convenient to all areas of Seattle and the view was great. Our trip was excellent and would definitely stay here again!! Paula\\'s home is lovely; we stayed for four days and were so happy with our experience! The kitchen/dining/living room area is warm and comfortable - we spent hours hanging out there with our toddler, while he went crazy over the toys Paula generously made available. Paula herself was lovely - available if needed, not around otherwise. Overall I\\'d highly recommend staying here. Dahlia\\'s place was a perfect base for us to explore Seattle and the lovely walkable attractions of Ballard in particular. Dahlia went out of her way to make sure we were well catered for; the apartment was clean, amazingly well organized and had everything you could need in a home from home, even stocking the fridge with bits and pieces that we might need.\\r\\n\\r\\nMake sure to visit some of the places that Dahlia has recommended. We enjoyed our meal at La Carta de Oaxaca, had great breakfast at Portage Bay on the walk to Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, and the Farmer\\'s Market is a must do if you are there on a Sunday. I\\'d also highly recommend the D\\'Ambrosio Gelato.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bus service into the city works well (20-30 mins) if you don\\'t have a car or want to leave it behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were 2 adults plus a baby and the space was just right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Dahlia!  Dahlia\\'s apartment was perfect for myself and my wife to enjoy our honeymoon in Seattle. It is in a great location in relation to the city and provided a peaceful, quiet, relaxing environment. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a great Seattle experience! Dahlia\\'s place is just as pictured--bright, pretty and full of charm. We loved being on the fourth floor so we could open the windows and let the breezes come in and even see a little of the city. Dahlia is a super-organized and friendly hostess. She left a whole binder of suggestions and info (she has excellent taste in bakeries!). We also very much enjoyed the laid back Ballard/Fremont neighborhoods. Don\\'t hesitate to rent here! Dahlia\\'s apartment was perfect for my boyfriend and I during our quick weekend getaway to Seattle. Her place is very centrally located in Ballard, close to amazing restaurants, quaint boutiques, and bus lines to downtown Seattle. We loved exploring all of Ballard, as well as downtown during the Bumbershoot festival. The apartment was very clean and bright, and Dahlia was an amazing host. As my inaugural venture into the world of airbnb, Dahlia definitely made the process painless, and even provides guests with food recommendations (all of which proved to be spectacular). Thank you Dahlia! I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a beautiful place to relax with easy access to anywhere a sightseer may desire.  My mom and sister came to visit me in Seattle and I booked them at Dahlia\\'s place (there are no good hotels in Ballard!). They had a great, comfortable experience and it was wonderful having them so close by. The place was clean and Dahlia\\'s friend met us exactly on time to drop off the keys. I would definitely recommend her apartment for anyone wanting to stay in the Ballard neighborhood. We had a great stay at Dahlia\\'s Ballard abode. Her apartment was clean, cozy, and well-decorated (and full of coffee and other treats to enjoy). It\\'s located on a quiet block, two blocks from the ever-bustling Market Street. Ballard is a great spot for your Seattle visit, and Dahlia\\'s condo is a perfect home base. Dahlia\\'s apartment was exactly what we needed for the week. We were traveling with an 11 month old and her place gave us enough room to spread out. It is right in the middle of Ballard. Unfortunately we were there during the hottest part of the summer and the apartment doesn\\'t have A/C but i was assured by our friends that the weather wasn\\'t normal and most people do not have A/C. Dahlia did have a fan that helped to cool down the apartment and there was a great breeze coming through.\\r\\nDahlia left everything for us including travel sized toilet tree items which was helpful when we ran out of toothpaste.  Dahlia was an amazing host. I\\'m only giving her five stars because I cannot give her six. Her place is as warm as charming as the picutres would indicate. She left a binder of information on what to do around Ballard - specifically a list of great restaurant/market locations. She\\'s also great at communicating - every question I had she answered within a day - most of the time much less than that. Everything was clean and tidy upon arrival and supplied us with some amazing amenities. I would highly recommend Dahlia\\'s space to use for anyone who is interested in staying in Seattle. Her apartment is a quick bus ride off the D line to downtown Seattle. I had no trouble getting to anywhere I wanted to - whether it be the Space Needle, the Seattle Center, the Public Market and many more! I could not recommend her space highly enough and will look for her listings in the future when I return to Seattle! Thanks Dahlia so much!  We had a wonderful time staying at Dahlia\\'s!  It\\'s a great place and in a perfect location.  Right around everything you\\'d want to see and do in Ballard.  She made our stay very enjoyable.  Highly recommended! Excellent place!!  Very clean and the owner was very helpful and accommodating.  Bathroom was amazing and the heated floors and towel rack were great!  Highly recommended! This was a lovely place to stay. Very well laid out, and the bathroom with heated floor and the giant shower with rain shower head is fantastic. The location is great, very close to the terrific restaurants in Ballard. I would definitely come back. Julien was welcoming and accommodating. Our family of  4 enjoyed staying in this beautiful townhouse. The neighborhood was perfect for us! Ballard is great and it\\'s within driving distance to downtown Seattle. The townhouse was clean, spacious and the beds were super comfy! The heated floors in the bathroom were awesome in the morning and the shower is my dream shower! Highly recommend staying here!! We will be back! We loved this house! Comfortable beds and shower was amazing. We enjoyed watching movies on Netflix. The host provided very specific and helpful instructions on things like how to work the shower, heater, and complicated door lock. \\r\\n\\r\\nTip for staying here (and most air bnb homes): bring your own blow dryer! This was our first time using airbnb. Although we personally did not meet our hosts, communication via email was excellent. The two bedroom townhouse with a fully stocked kitchen made the experience even more enjoyable as we purchased local food from nearby Ballard open market. The beds were comfortable and the heated bathroom was a dream. Julien\\'s condo is beautiful and in a great location. Communicating with Julien was super easy, he is way more responsive than are my own family and friends! His instructions for the condo were thorough and any questions we had he was immediately responsive. This was my first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful thanks to Julien! Nice apartment. Our experience was just right. Beds were comfortable, rooms were clean and directions for everything were well written. We only used the space for sleeping, so it was fine.  We recently relocated from the Bay Area, and needed a place to stay our first night in town. Julien\\'s place was perfect! The townhouse was spacious, bright, and clean, and Julien was communicative, welcoming and accommodating. Great neighborhood, house directions were easy to follow, beds were comfy, bathroom/shower were delightful. Highly recommend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Julien!  Julien\\'s house was very amazing! He\\'s very communicative and polite! His house was very clean and located in the midst of Ballard which is very nice because you could travel by foot or bus nearly! He\\'s also very responsive and understanding. I love the features that he had in his hometown, such as the bathroom floor, kitchen, and he even provide roku! This house made my first experience using Airbnb wonderful!! Me and my family have stayed in this house 2 different times and we look forward to our next stay at Julien\\'s house!! Julien\\'s place was lovely, warm, clean, and convenient. We met, on the second day, when he came by to change a lightbulb, and he was very easy-going and helpful. Parking was a relative breeze (surprise!), and it was nice to have the convenience of a washer and dryer in the apartment. Ballard is a wonderful neighborhood, and I will look for lodging here again, the next time I visit Seattle.\\r\\n Julien was a great host... Had instructions for everything detailed out and checked in with us upon our arrival. Very clean and spacious townhouse. The townhouse is on a busy road so there is some traffic noise in the bedroom, but it\\'s in an urban neighborhood and very close to all of the great shops, restaurants and bars in Ballard.\\r\\nWould be more than happy to stay hear again! This is one of the best AirBnB places we have ever stayed in.  Large, spacious house with great furnishings in a cool area.  A bus out the front will have you in downtown Seattle in 30 minutes or it\\'s a short 15 minute walk to Ballard where there are a huge number of restaurants, bars and cafes.\\r\\n\\r\\nJulien did everything possible to make our stay comfortable and easy.  Check in and out was a breeze.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely recommend this place to all my friends and have no hesitation staying here again if we find ourselves back in Seattle.    This place has a problem--you can\\'t lock the front door. We had four intelligent, educated, competent adults puzzling over the elaborate instructions, and we could not get it to engage. The lock needs to be replaced before you rent it again.\\r\\n   It\\'s a nice place--bamboo floors, fancy shower--but sparsely furnished. There are no pictures on the walls, and the living room echoes in the emptiness.\\r\\n   But it is as advertised. The kitchen is well stocked with dishes and pans and all. The beds are super comfy, and there are lots of pillows. The host was helpful with questions that I had. The space was as described and very clean. Thank you. The space was as described and great for walking distance attractions!  Great place, great neighborhood, great host.  All directions were spelled out nicely making check in and check out a breeze. Will plan to stay next time we are in town. We had a wonderful trip. Julien made us feel right at home and provided us with lots of useful information about the apartment and the neighborhood.  The apartment was spacious and very clean. It was in a great location with just a quick walk to many bars, restaurants, and public transportation.  We would definitely stay there again.  Julien was an amazing host. He went above and beyond to recommend places to visit and eats to check out. His place is very clean, warm, and modern. Close  to the main  area in Ballard with lots of things to do. LOVED the heated tiles and the fancy shower. Towels were thick and comfy, beds were big and inviting, and should you have a car-parking was a breeze. I couldn\\'t figure out how to work the Roku the first night we were there and Julien came to immediate rescue with batteries and then came back a second time to set it up for us so it was ready for use when we got back. He responds quickly to inquiries and communicates well. He was accommodating to us and let us drop off our luggage hours before check in time and we were actually a bit late in checking out but he was very kind and understanding. He had a house manual that thoroughly provided all the information we needed on the place. Thank you so very much for having us, we look forward to our next stay with you. Julien made sure I had everything I needed before I thought to ask. The place is very clean with room to spread out and has nice little features like the heated tile floor in the bathroom. The location was perfect as well, I will be returning the next time I am in Seattle. Love this apartment, clean, comfy and a great location close to downtown Ballard. Perfect for a weekend getaway with friends. The well thought out booklet for the house came in handy! Would recommend to anyone!\\r\\nThanks Julien Neighborhood was great, property was on point and loved all the amenities the property had.    Julien\\'s townhome is a lovely and comfortable place.  Great location and spotlessly clean.  We would definitely think of staying there again on a future trip to Seattle.   The home was very clean and everything was as described in the listing. Great location and plenty of space. There were four of us staying in the home and we were all very pleased. Thank you! This townhouse was very clean and had all the essentials for a relaxing stay. Good location within walking distance to Cafe Besalu\\'s tasty pastries and coffee. Julien was great host.  Would live at this townhouse...hope to come back. Thanks. My mother and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Julien\\'s townhouse. We were there for a week and it was nice to come back after a day of exploring. Both beds were very comfortable and the place was immaculate. We were happy we chose the Ballard neighborhood. It was like coming home to a small village. Julien responded to questions and concerns within minutes. Highly recommend! Finally if you have a car take it on the ferry to Brainbridge island and and if not walk onto the ferry. It is a lovely day trip.  My husband, son and I stayed here while visiting our daughter who lives in Ballard.  Julien was very responsive.  Townhouse matched description.  Be sure to get to cafe Besalu for pastry and Sunset park for views.   Julien\\'s town home was comfortable, spacious for the four of us, very clean, well appointed, and full of light. Julien\\'s house guide is precise and thorough and he was helpful in recommending favorites amongst the many many nearby restaurants and activities of Ballard. His response time to questions is nearly immediate. Parking is on the street or around the corner and was never a problem for us. There are lots of places in Ballard within walking distance. We truly enjoyed our stay here.  The home was wonderful and a great layout and location!  We really enjoyed having space to relax while we enjoyed the city!  It was within walking distance to so many cute shops, restaurants and the grocery store!  There was also a nice book with recommendations of where to eat and where to visit in the condo. \\nHosts were great and able to be reached easily for questions!\\n Photos were accurate. Julien was helpful the entire way and even texted me the first night to make sure I arrived on time. The apt was very clean. THE BATHROOM IS SO NICE!!! This Ballard townhouse was so cozy and was the perfect place for our Seattle trip. We loved the location, loved having an actual house to make our base in between wandering around the city, and Julien was quick to respond to all of our questions and concerns. He and his wife also gave us great recommendations for what to do in the area.  Ballard is an amazing neighborhood, and we were really glad to be staying there. Everything about our stay was efficient and as we hoped! The townhouse was clean, well-appointed, and we would love to stay there again.   Had an excellent stay at Julien\\'s spot!! The place is super spacious and clean and nice and in a really cool neighborhood that we actually never left the 2 days we were in town. (It helped that we played at the Tractor Tavern down the street which is a really cool little music venue btw.) Julien was very responsive even though we booked last minute, and sent over a detailed and nicely organized packet of info on the house, like how to use the shower, laundry, locking up, etc. Bathroom and shower were hella nice too, and a cute little balcony. Would definitely stay here again. This was a very comfortable two bedroom in the popular Ballard neighborhood.  It\\'s located on a busy street.  It was a warm evening and we  left our bedroom window open.   It was a bit noisy from the traffic. I would definitely recommend it.  Julien went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and welcome. We absolutely loved our stay and would stay here again in a heartbeat. As advertised, the townhouse was very clean. Highly recommend if you\\'re looking to stay in Ballard (which I would also recommend doing).  The place is exactly as described. It looks even better in person. I didn\\'t meet him, but when I called about checking out, he was very kind and provided a great breakfast recommendation. I would stay here again hands-down. Julien was great!  The day I was arriving there was an annual \"Norwegian Pride Parade\" in Ballard and he gave me great instructions on how to avoid getting caught up in traffic in getting to his Airbnb.  My co-worker and I stayed in the home as part of a work trip.  House was awesome...  Julien was also SUPER fast at responding to my enquiry.  Made me feel confident that everything would go smoothly, as it did. Thanks to Julien for hosting us.  We stayed with our three kids in the townhouse for 4 nights while the floors in our house were being refinished.  The listing was accurate, and we felt right at home from start to finish.  There was plenty of space in the front bedroom for two twin aero-beds in addition to the bed that was there.  It was an easy half-mile walk down 24th to the center of Ballard. Julien was very helpful and friendly when coordinating and the place is fantastic.  It worked well for five people, because the place is so spacious.  I only stayed one night, but would definitely have wanted to stay longer to make use of the great kitchen, living room, and amenities.  Apartment was awesome!  Julien was super helpful and responsive.  Everything was clean and easy.  Julien\\'s place was perfect for us.  Everything was clean and looked exactly as it did in the photos.  The couch is comfortable in the living room.  We enjoyed watching a couple Netflix and Youtube videos in the evening after we came back from exploring Seattle.  The bedrooms were great and everyone enjoyed the fancy shower! Had to cancel last minute.  Julien was super easy to work with. Julien was very easy to communicate with and our check-in/out was seamless. The home had all the basics we needed to cook and feel right at home. The location was convenient to Seattle, restaurants, and nightlife. Julien provided lots of awesome recommendations as well, which helped get our short stay off on the right note. I would definitely consider staying again the next time I\\'m up in Seattle. Thanks for having us, Julien! Julien was a great host! He was quick to respond throughout my stay and provided detailed info on any and all questions. The house itself was great. Lots of space and very clean.  Overall our experience was very good.  Ballard is a great community and one that was easy to get around in.                   My family\\'s stay in Julien\\'s townhome was fantastic. It was the perfection combination of space and privacy with accessibility to downtown Ballard and Seattle. Julien\\'s guidebook was exceedingly helpful - we ended up eating at two of the restaurants he recommended, both of which were excellent and only a ten minute walk away. \\r\\n\\r\\nJulien was kind enough to leave Keurig coffee for us, something which was greatly appreciated for a caffeine addict such as me. Both the kitchen and main bathroom were modern, clean, and stylish, and we had no trouble finding parking within a block of the residence. Julien was incredibly accommodating and helpful.  The apartment was clean and bright. His welcome manual was detailed and clear, with step-by-step instructions for all aspects of the home, from the lock on the door to controlling the heat. We loved the neighborhood and appreciated the suggestions for local restaurants and services.  The bathroom is beautiful, so tasteful and luxurious!  Thanks for a great stay! Julien provided us with a very helpful house manual that answered all questions we had. Pictures listed are accurate and the shower is great. Our only complaint about our stay is that we happened to come during a heat wave and there was no AC in the house (or fans) to make it more comfortable. We had to keep windows open and the street was pretty noisy. Overall, we had a great stay in Ballard and the location of the house was very ideal to explore easily without a car. Would return! Our experience was great! A beautiful home close to the heart of Ballard! Julien was very helpful throughout the booking process to make sure things went smoothly!  Good accommodations, nice place, would rent again! Would stay here again. Lots of public parking nearby. Host very accommodating. Thorough guide and easy check in. My cousins and I really enjoyed Julien\\'s location in Ballard. It\\'s only a few blocks away from Market Street, the center of activity, the vibrant Sunday Farmer\\'s Market, Starbucks and shops. We liked that there was a grocery store so near by and that the reknown ship locks, lovely gardens and fish ladder were a seven minute drive away. It was also easy for us to drive down the street and get on the major thoroughfare and within 10- 15 minutes be able to go sightseeing at some of the major tourist attractions. Julien\\'s home is trendy, bright and cheery with lots of space to move around in. Nice kitchen stocked with the essentials. All the necessities we needed were there including comfortable beds. My cousins and I agreed, we would definitely stay here again. Great place.  We just stayed overnight, and used very little of the amenities available, but it was very practical, very nice, and in a great spot.  It is within walking distance to the center of Ballard (restaurants etc.) and there are local coffee shops etc very close to the condo.  \\r\\nI will definitely stay there again if the opportunity presents itself - no question.   The listing was very accurate and the place was very clean. The hosts were extremely nice and were very quick to respond to any questions we had. If i\\'m back in this area I would stay again.  Nice place to stay for a family :-) Julien is a fantastic host! Super easy to communicate with and takes great care to make guests feel welcome. The listing is lovely and in a fantastic location, just a few blocks away from restaurants, shops, parks .. the best of Ballard! Highly recommend and would happily stay here again! My hosts were great even though I did not meet them.  They always got back to me promptly and the house manual was very informative. Clean, comfortable, and great location. Hosts were very friendly and helpful.  The townhome advertised was as expected. The rooms, restrooms, kitchen, and the rest of the rooms were clean. Our family of five stayed in the townhome for six days. Two person per bed, and the fifth person used a (borrowed) air mattress. \\nThis home met our needs,including extra sheets and blanket for our air mattress. \\nA parking space would have been nice, but we always found a street parking within the block, so it was OK. \\nWe would definitely stay in this townhouse again. I recommend this place. Please note that the home is a 3-story, so it\\'s not ADA friendly.  Just as adverstised! Clean, spacious, walking distance to Ballard\\'s restaurants and shops. We would definitely stay again. Natalie even dropped by to provide coffee for the morning. We were there when it was pretty warm, so the street noise was noticable with the windows open. But that wouldn\\'t stop me from staying again. Thanks!!  Julien and Natalie were very responsive and helpful. Their place is comfortable and nice, and for those wanting a Seattle neighborhood experience (great Ballard location), highly recommended. Spacious town home with very responsive and attuned hosts!  We stayed here last minute after a home emergency displaced us.  Close to everything wonderful Ballard has to offer! Julien was a superb host! He was always very responsive and considerate with us. The house itself was very big and nice, specially the bathroom which is beautiful! Situation is also centroc, in a famous area of Seattle. One thing we found is that there was not a lot of kitchen cutlery given that we were 5 and it was a bit noisy at night. In any case, we enjoyef it and would recommend this place to others. Thank you for everything, Julien! Wonderful accomodations! Lovely place, excellent beds. Quiet despite being on a busy strert. Host was very responsive. Would definitely stay here agsin! Julien was very accommodating from the time I made the reservation.  Willing to let us check in an hour early and quickly available for any questions we had beforehand.  The house manual was very handy and had lots of great info.  Their place was very clean and exactly as the listing stated.  I would definitely stay here again!  Wow!!! Julien is everything you want in an airbnb host! The communication was perfect! Upon booking the listing Julien sent a pdf answering every possible question one might have about the space and the surrounding area!! \\r\\nThe space itself was beautiful and modern. Don\\'t think twice about staying here!!! Book it now! Julien was very helpful, the home was clean and quiet, and we had a lovely stay. Julien was the perfect host! Super helpful with a manual to the house, and plenty of communication.  Julien or Natalie were always easy to contact.  The house was clean and very welcoming.  Overall a great stay!! Julien was very welcoming and let us know that he was available if any problems should arise. Julien was a communicative, gracious, and discreet host, and his house is AMAZING. The bathroom alone makes this location worth it, with nice heated floor, dual-head shower, and heated towel rack. The bedrooms were tastefully and comfortably furnished, and the roomy kitchen was fully stocked. The washer and dryer are a final nice touch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location\\'s also excellent--really close to a bus stop, down the street from delicious coffee and bakeries, but still in a peaceful, quiet neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nI honestly don\\'t know why he doesn\\'t charge more, because hotels at equivalent prices were put to shame. For our first AirBnB experience, I don\\'t think we could have done any better! This was a lovely place to stay! We love the bathroom with heated floor and the giant shower with rain shower head. Julien’s place was very clean and everything was as described in the listing. We enjoyed our stay!  Everything went smoothly!  Julien was very thorough with the instructions and access was easy.  It is a great space located close to lots of cool spots in Ballard.  Right on the bus line to downtown as well.  Would stay again in a heartbeat!  He even mailed some items we inadvertently left behind back to us.  Wonderful host.   The home was beautiful and well kept up, and Julien was a very gracious and accommodating host. He was kind enough to let us drop off our bags when an unexpected issue came up with our trip. There were thorough instructions provided for everything, which was also greatly appreciated. The description for the town home was spot on. It was a great size and really clean. The area was perfect for what our plans were. The shower was super cool, and I must admit I LOVED the heated floors! The only part that was tricky and we had to keep referring back to the manual for was the front door locking & unlocking. Took us some time to figure it out.  The townhouse was impecably clean and everything we needed was there! Loved the extra large european shower, this made up for not having a bathtub!\\r\\nThe neighborhood is one of the best in Seattle, with ALL amenities walking distance. Our comute to Bell Harbor Peir was a hop skip and a jump, really easy to get downtown also. This home worked perfectly for our weekend in Seattle!  We loved the area (Ballard).  There were lots of great restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance.  It was also very easy to drive to downtown Seattle.  Home was very clean and has a great remodeled bathroom.  Parking was not a problem.  Would definitely recommend! Great place! Clean, fresh, roomy and it got everything you need. Comfortable queen size beds and fresh toilets. And close to the center of Ballard where you have nice restaurants and shops everywhere.  The house manual was really detailed; that was really welcoming because it was easy to get up to speed on the various aspects of the house. We had a great stay. The size was perfect for us. Julien checked in with us to make sure everything was okay. I appreciated his concern for our stay.  Julien and Natalie were extremely kind hosts!  I never met them, but felt comfortable letting them know if I needed anything.  It\\'s also obvious that they know the AirBnb system well.  There was a helpful guidebook on the coffee table (which was emailed as well) that answered any questions I might have.  I wish all AirBnb\\'s did this!  \\r\\n\\r\\nYes, the front door has a \"system\" to it (it\\'s a Mortise lock) - but the guidebook clearly explains how it works, so be sure to give yourself a good 5 minutes to figure it out.  I had no problem getting the keys out of the lockbox - again, clearly explained in the guidebook.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, onto the townhome.  The BATHROOM!  As other guests have pointed out, probably the best room in the house!  The heated floors were a wonderful touch, especially on those cold, overcast Seattle days.  The shower was beautiful, and felt brand new.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI actually slept in the guest bedroom, because the master bedroom was a bit loud due to the street noise.  It was not a problem; both rooms have direct entrance to the bathroom, and both beds are comfortable.  Was wonderful to have a washer/dryer on the property, since I stayed for an extended period of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe downstairs area is very airy and bright, which I love.  Nice big kitchen.  There were a few amenities lacking - wine key, can opener, cookie sheet - but I\\'ve made note of this to the hosts, so hopefully these items will be added soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood felt very safe.  I had to park my rental car rather far away a couple of times around midnight, and felt safe walking back to the townhome by myself.  Note that unless you make it home before 4pm, it\\'s pretty difficult to find a spot right on 24th.  Perhaps this is due to some construction that was occurring on both sides of the street and therefore took away spots.  The trendy part of Ballard is only .6 miles away, so easily walkable.  Very cute area with lots of restaurant/shopping options!\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly recommend this place.  Thank you Julien and Natalie for making me feel so welcome! Julien was a very welcoming and responsive host. My husband and I had arrived exhausted after a tough flight across country (delayed three hours, after arising at 3:15am), and we found Julian\\'s instructions for key access clear and easy to follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, there was a small glitch with bedroom heating, which Julien was VERY prompt and courteous in responding to and fixing, and we slept very comfortably after our (unrelated) traveling ordeals! (Thank you for the good bed and comfortable bedding!)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs described, the apartment was very spacious and clean. As a couple, we were using less than half the given the second bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, Julien, for your hospitality and responsiveness! We enjoyed this townhouse in Ballard. The location was convenient for exploring Seattle. The neighborhood is nice, but parking was sort of tricky most days. Maybe around 40% of the time we were able to park on 24th Street itself there on the same block as the townhouse. The rest of the time we had to find a spot up around the corner, maybe a 3-5 minute walk away. \\n\\nThe townhouse itself is nice and quite spacious. Nice to have an extra half bath. The kitchen is large but some things were lacking. Only four forks was definitely not going to cut it, so within the first hour I was off to the grocery store to buy some plastic cutlery (some of which we left behind for others after us to use) as well as some basics like sugar (also left some) and pepper that were absent. \\n\\nThe tv with Netflix was very nice to have, and the beds were comfortable. The street noise in the master bedroom wasn\\'t too big a deal for us because we are used to that at home, but if you aren\\'t used to road noise be aware that it is significant. The smaller back bedroom is quiet though. \\n\\nThe hosts were out of town so we never met, but Julien was prompt and helpful over email. This home was was perfect for my family\\'s weekend visit to Seattle. The location was great (near restaurants in Ballard) and the home was clean and well organized. Julien was very helpful and responsive to my questions. I definitely would recommend. Julien was a great host and was quick to respond with any questions. The condo was as described and was within walking distance to a number of great restaurants. The heated floors in the upstairs bathroom were amazing. Julien also provided a house guidebook that had clear instructions for the property and points of interest in Ballard. Overall, we had an amazing time in Ballard and Julien\\'s property was perfect. Absolutely fantastic stay. Apartment exactly the same as pictures. Very clean and spacious. Julien was quick to respond to questions and very accommodating. Highly recommended. Lovely apartment in Ballard.  Julien came over to help us out when the front door key wouldn\\'t work and was sorry we had to deal with that inconvenience.  He is very gracious and I\\'d suggest you meet with him at the beginning of your stay so he can explain the things that aren\\'t straightforward about the apartment--operating the front door lock and the upscale shower.  If you\\'re sensitive to noise (I am; my husband\\'s not) I\\'d suggest you bring ear plugs and/or a source of \"white noise.\"  We enjoyed staying at Julien\\'s place in wonderful Ballard WA. The location and size were perfect for our needs. \\nLook forward to staying there again someday!\\nKevin  Had a great stay at Julien\\'s place. He was very communicative through our stay. The apartment was very spacious and had everything we needed. The downstairs was quite cold though. Julien\\'s place was perfect for our group. We\\'ve been to Seattle many times so the location and apartment itself were exactly what we wanted. Julien was very helpful when there was a small issue with the heating and came by and fixed it right away. I had a wonderful stay at Beverly\\'s place.  It is quaint and charming she is a lovely host.  It was fun to be in the Ballard near the water.  I enjoyed taking in all the fine restaurants available near by.  There a nice neighborhood areas to talk walks in.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Earlier this week I had the pleasure of spending a night in this lovely home in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. The accommodations were as described, and the photos don\\'t really do justice to the charm of this apartment. The kitchen was well stocked, and I felt really at home here.  We had a great time staying in this beautiful Ballard home.  We found it so easy to get around this area- the house is very walkable to Old Ballard, Golden Gardens, and other Seattle neighborhoods.  Bev was extremely attentive and helpful, flexible with the meeting time, and so kind with all the extra amenities (like snacks and staples in the kitchen.)   Plus, the fruits and veggies in her garden are amazing!  We deeply appreciate how she made us feel at home during our stay! It was just as described! We loved the layout and was just the right size, actually bigger than anticipated. Bev was most helpful with her suggestions and her special touches appreciated! good location also - great stay! Loved the plumbs, tomatoes and all the extras you left us. That was perfect and helped make our stay a little easier. Great location and walkable to all the shops and businesses in downtown Ballard. Would definitely come back! Beverly Sanders was or is the perfect hostess. She met me at the lovely Victorian house at the agreed on time of arrival, with a nice welcome and a big smile on her face. showed me around and explained everything that I needed to know for my stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location was perfect since I was visiting friends in the Ballard area. I could walk to wherever I needed to go, except for touring the area in my friends car.\\r\\nIt was a most enjoyable stay and everything was just as nice as advertised on Airbub!!\\r\\nJohn Robbins\\r\\n This is a large private apartment with state of the art, well equipped kitchen and a cozy bathroom with a claw foot tub.   Beverly is a great host and very responsive should you need anything.  This apartment is located very close to the town of Ballard and that makes it even more special!  Thanks again for a very comfortable stay! My experience was fantastic. My host was present, accurate and available. The space was ready, with all one could ask for and more. My host gave me a tour, and I adored this special space from the moment I stepped in the door. Very clean, very comfortable, safe, convenient and full of charm and delight. I especially loved your guidance to the views and the local gems, such as the bakery...all the perfect stroll from the patio. Thank you Beverly for opening your little space in heaven in Seattle-Ballard.\\r\\nIn appreciation and hope to visit again one day, star   This place is really nice!  It\\'s spacious, clean, well kept and cozy.  It\\'s even a lot closer to the main drag of Ballard than I initially thought (ten minutes or less walking).  Beverly was a nice host.  We only saw her upon checking in, but she was very responsive to texts and even provided aspirin when my girlfriend had a headache.  We would definitely stay here again! Beverly was attentive, to make sure that we had everything that we needed, but not intrusive. The apartment was spacious, with a wonderful kitchen, which we enjoyed doing a bit of holiday baking in. There were fixings for multiple breakfasts and morning coffee. We enjoyed that a lot. Pretty awesome place! Close to everything we need: Safeway, restaurants, clubs, cafes etc. \\nJust 10 minutes away from Seattle downtown tourist zone (Space Needle as example of one of the most popular).\\nKerry park, Google campus, different parks and access to ferry - everything is pretty close. Ow, and apartments itself are new, and it was pleasure to live there. Thanks, Tim. Tim was an amazing host. Not only was he extremely flexible with us on arrival and departure times for our stay, he prepped linens and maintained a very clean space for our one night stay in the Ballard area. His apartment complex was new and fresh and the interior decor presented a homey modern Seattle vibe. It was exactly what we were looking for!\\n\\nThanks so much Tim! We would definitely recommend you as host to any of our friends!\\n\\nWill & Hannah Tim was a great host. Very easy to work with, and he had everything we needed. His place is terrific, great location. Walking distance to very nice restaurants and grocery stores. We will definitely stay there again. This was a great apartment in the heart of Ballard-near a grocery store, shops, restaurant and bus line.  The place was very clean and had everything you could want.  We stayed a week and even the Seattle weather was great! Tim greeted me and gave me a overview of the apartment. Everything was clean and in order. Right by downtown Ballard. Great place to stay Marty was a very enthusiastic host.  Marty met us at the apartment, and showed us how everything worked, about parking in the neighborhood, etc.  The apartment was sparking clean, had a nice view and was spacious.  Ballard is very convenient to downtown Seattle by bus or car.  The apartment was accuratly described in the listing, and did not disappoint. Marty & Taryn\\'s house was perfect! Just as shown in the photos, a warm, clean, minimally decorated home ideal for a family like ours traveling with a young child. Our son loved the kids room & toys. Marty was kind and welcoming taking time to tell us about what to expect around the neighborhood, leaving a detailed note of favorite restaurants, cafes, bars, etc around Ballard, as well as leaving us a pound of his favorite local coffee beans. Marty was available to answer any questions we had and made us feel his home was ours. We enjoyed our stay! We had such a great time in Marty and Taryn\\'s lovely condo. The setup was ideal for us as we were traveling with two small children. The home was super-clean and baby friendly, and our kids had so much fun there. The condo itself is right in the heart of Ballard, so everything was an easy stroll, and the view was a treat. Also worth mentioning is that there is a huge market on the ground level of the building, which is very convenient. The Penners were extremely hospitable--leaving treats for us and checking in to make sure we had everything that we needed. I highly recommend this home and we hope to stay here again the next time we visit Seattle.  The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting. Really straightforward, no hiccups whatsoever. Great to stay in Ballard! As gracious of hosts as I\\'ve ever had on AirBnB! Place was clean, lovely, and easy to access. Great location to explore Ballard and more interesting, non-touristy parts of Seattle. Parking on street wasn\\'t hard to find. Taryn and Martin easy to communicate with as well.  This was our first experience with Airbnb and I don\\'t have enough words to describe what a wonderful experience we had with Taryn and Martin, beautiful place, very clean, great location and great great hosts! Clear and prompt communication and they made our stay so easy in every single aspect, they even recommended their baby sitter (Thanks Tori). \\r\\n Peppered Marty and Taryn with so many questions even before we arrived which they gracefully and promptly answered (anxious first time parents traveling here), which I really appreciated. Met Marty at one of his pizza places to pick up the keys - very friendly and welcoming to Seattle and his place (even left us some local beers to sample - tasty considering the incredibly hot weather Seattle was having). Photos of his family\\'s lovely home are accurate - comfortable especially with our active mobile 10-month-old daughter! Felt like home while we there for a long weekend visiting friends. Neighborhood was filled with lots of young families, plenty of bakeries and coffee places within walking distance. Can\\'t wait to visit again! My wife and I loved staying at Marty and Taryn\\'s place with our 20-month-old son. We had been to Seattle a few times before, and knew that we wanted to stay in Ballard to take advantage of the restaurants, shopping and Sunday market. The location of the apartment is perfect for everything — you\\'re just a few minutes\\' walk from some of the best restaurants, coffee shops, bars and shopping in the city. And it\\'s only a bit longer to walk to the Locks (which seems weird, but is actually really cool) or several great parks, and a short drive to the zoo. Marty and Taryn have an excellent list of recommendations to help you decide between all the options.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place itself is clean, full of light, and has great views. Having an extra room with toys and books for our son was fantastic. And Taryn and Marty really made us feel welcome. Marty personally checked us in, gave me recommendations and answered questions about the complex and neighborhood. He even had some local beer waiting in the fridge. And both of them checked on us during our stay to make sure everything was going well. We’d love to stay at their place again next time we’re in Seattle.  Marty & Taryn were great to us! Their home is wonderful and the neighborhood was perfect; they gave us lots of suggestions on what to do, where to go, what to eat, etc. Our (almost) 3 year old loved it, and we have never had such a nice time in any hotel with him before. The park next to their building was great to run around in too (helped our son burn off that extra energy from the time change!). It was very easy to catch a bus to the EMP, Pike Place, and Miners Landing from there. We would recommend that anyone with small children stay here if they want to avoid hotels and get a real feel for the city.  The cottage was great!  Brad and Liz are very friendly and welcoming - they made us feel right at home and their place is very comfortable.  It was in a great location in Ballard - you can walk to the cute part of town, to the Locks and also to the water. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely stay here again. Thanks! Liz and Brad were wonderful hosts and very friendly and smart, I liked that about them. Brad and I connected quickly because of our science backgrounds and we could have talked science for days. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe studio is very nice and having art around is indeed inspiring, the bathroom was quaint and nice and the bed ok for two. The garden was fun and I love the Ballard area this is a great find for airbnb folks. Downtown Ballard is a happening area with great places to eat like Bastille and I love being around anything fishing boat because I grew up in a fishing town. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood was so quiet and quaint I could not believe it, we left early on Sunday and did not get a chance to say goodbye to such nice and friendly folks.  My husband and I stayed in Liz & Brad\\'s cottage for our anniversary week-end.  It was the perfect place to relax in a beautiful little cottage surrounded by art and the gardens.  Liz and Brad were very helpful in suggesting great places for breakfast, dinner and entertainment.  All within walking distance.  We live in Kingston, across the water from Seattle and our time at their little cottage felt like we were in another world.  Lot\\'s to do but a cozy place to come back to and relax.  I would recommend their cottage/studio as a home away from home but even better.  Darcy Herrett The cottage was great! Their studio is amazing, and the bed was comfortable. Their garden was really beautiful and Liz & Brad are really nice -- we loved our stay. Thanks again! :) We very much enjoyed our time at the cottage.  Perfect location and size - not to mention the wonderful art! Very warm and welcoming and comfortable people and place, a great space to retreat to after a day of dashing about seeing friends and family and concerts and plays.  I fancied the garden style and loved the smell of tuberose as you walked up the path.  Imagined I would get further in Eric Metaxas\\' new biography of Dietrich Bonhoffer I purchased for the occasion but loved the quiet reading time I did manage. Bed is compfy, studio is spacious and attractive, Liz and Brad were gracious hosts, would stay there again in a heartbeat. Our stay was great! We were in contact with Brad prior to our arrival to make sure everything was O.K. and he was extremely helpful. The cottage was amazing. I cannot imagine wanting to stay anywhere else if we manage to visit again. After several days on the road, we were able to relax in such a beautiful and comfortable space. The Ballard area is fun and has a wide range of shops, restaurants, and cafes. Downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods are easily accessible by bus. Liz and Brad even had a little basket of information about the area - including a waterproof map and bus schedules - near the bed. Addison and I enjoyed meeting Brad and had a wonderful chat. We enjoyed the studio and missed not seeing the artist! We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay at Liz & Brad\\'s lovely cottage in Ballard, Washington. They could not have been nicer or more accomodating. The cottage was everything we had hoped for. We were surrounded by the art works, pictures and sculptures, of Liz that were in varying stages of completion. Liz is a talented artist as well as a mathemetics teacher.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cottage was nicely decorated and was warm and cozy, even when it got a little cool outside while we slept. The futon was very comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have no complaints and do not hesitate to recommend this place to others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks, Liz and Brad. You helped make our stay in the pacific northwest a memorable one. The cottage was a delightful sanctuary.  I was greeted with the scent of flower petals, lavender and a comfortable bed in a garden setting. After an extremely hectic day preparing for a family wedding I could return to the cottage for a shower, a cup of tea and some peace and quiet before returning to the next event.  The centralized Ballard location was great, I was able to walk or drive a short way to shopping, the Ballard locks for pre-wedding photos, and then to the wedding site at the Ballard community center.  Thank you Brad and Liz! We enjoyed our stay. Brad & Liz are friendly. We also love the cat! The space is quite cozy and comfortable tucked away in the garden.  Weather permitting get takeout, a bottle of wine and relax under the arbor.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiz and Brad provided helpful insight into the Seattle culture--the stuff you don\\'t get in guide books. They were extremely accessible while also giving us all the privacy we may have needed.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ballard business district-within walking distance- offers plenty of food,shopping and entertainment choices.\\r\\n\\r\\nI vote Liz&Brad as AirBnB\\'s poster couple. The cottage is awesome and was much nicer than staying in a hotel room for a week.  There were hummingbirds outside in the morning and cat visits if wanted.  I would stay here again if I return to Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinda I am a little relunctant to leave a positive review out of fear this lovely retreat will be discovered.\\r\\nThis is a private cottage set in a wonderful neighborhood of well cared for homes. The surroundings offer interesting architecture, pride in gardens, lots of birds, a community shoping area with character and a Farmer Market which is treat to the eye as much as the palate. It is a peaceful and quiet area of Seattle and Ballard is a great for walking. \\r\\n\\r\\nLiz and Rick are perfect - helpful but not intrusive.\\r\\nThey own two wonderful young cats.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will be back. Liz and Brad\\'s place is great--cozy cottage in a beautiful garden.  It is very convenient to downtown Seattle via the bus and walkable to all of the great restaurants and bars in Ballard.  I would definitely recommend it.   Liz & Brad\\'s cottage is perfect for a weekend getaway. They are extremely hospitable and the cottage is wonderfully laid out.  This is a sweet little cottage in a great neighborhood, close to lots of interesting shops and restaurants yet the cottage is quiet and peaceful.  Liz and Brad were very kind and generous and I would definitely stay there again. To gain perspective, I have waited to Rate and Review.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think Brad and Liz would agree that the heating in the studio over Thanksgiving  was inadequate for the weather/temperature.  The wood burning stove was inoperable and the two electric radiators (turned up to the maximum) did not provide enough heat.  Luckily, we had brought a down comforter from home. It was so cold inside, we were unable to shower.   \\r\\n\\r\\nFrankly, had I been the hosts, I would have notified my  guests  ahead of time about the heating conditions and not tell them about it when they arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad we known, we definitely would have made other arrangements.  \\r\\n\\r\\nJeanne Ferguson\\r\\n3905 NE Davis Street\\r\\nPortland Oregon 97232 Great place and very walkable to a quaint retail shopping area. Brad recently improved the insulation, so we were comfortable despite how cold it was outside.  Liz and Brad were delightful hosts.  Their Ballard Cottage is so comfortable and cozy, great for one or two guests.  My relatives nearby wanted to meet them but took sick over the holidays.  Perhaps next time.  Thanks for your warm hospitality.\\r\\n Liz and Brad were fantastic! The studio was small, but cute and we were constantly inspired by Liz\\'s art work. \\r\\n\\r\\nBallard is a great neighborhood. It is quiet, yet located to so many great coffee shops and places to eat. We had a great time!  Thanks Brad and Liz - this was a wonderful \"home away from home\" for us while we were in Ballard.  It\\'s a greaat  location in a quiet neighborhood, easy access to downtown Ballard, cozy and warm (even in January - and it will be cozier once the woodstove is fixed), beautiful art, and pleasant hosts.  What more could you ask for?  Well, maybe we could ask for all the flowers in the garden to be blooming, but then we\\'d have to stay until May.... My second stay with Brad and Liz and quite enjoyable.  The bed is very comfortable and they are great hosts.   This was an absolutely delightful cottage, and I hope to be back! It was a peaceful oasis - and so warm and cozy in the winter. Very well equipped, too, with everything one might need. A great find! A lovely space to stay at while visiting Seattle.  We especiaaly liked the neighborhood of Ballard - the Sunday market and the number of good reataurants and being near the locks. And Brad and Liz were great hosts---we had good times talking  to them. Great place. My parents loved it! Stayed with Brad and Liz (and Jasper and Lily!) for almost 2 weeks in their cottage while attending a cooking workshop.  Great place to relax and unwind while staying in Seattle.  Central and easy to get anywhere by bus or walking.  Beautiful gardens surround the cozy cottage where you can sit outside and enjoy the sunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will definitely stay with Brad and Liz again in the future.   Just a really lovely little cottage in a really nice part of town. A perfect way to visit Seattle and feel like a guest, not a tenant. Thanks, Brad and Liz! Liz and Brad\\'s Ballard cottage really hit the sweet spot for me - quiet and peaceful leading to a great night\\'s sleep, a perfect 10K distance from both Discovery and Golden Gardens Parks, friendly hosts but loads of privacy, plus two great cats and a really lovely garden.  Throw in back to back sunny days and wow what a great stay. We really enjoyed the cottage...it was a peaceful, cozy, and creative space to spend the week.  We really enjoyed the visits by Jasper and Lily the cats!  It was convenient to the bus routes, the Ballard Locks, the Botanical Gardens and a great running/walking path along the water.  Thanks so much! I spent 3 nights and was happy as a clam. The cottage is cozy and art filled, and the gardens are lovely. The house is well situated...I was able to walk to wonderful bakeries, the farmer\\'s market, and the locks. On my first morning, I thought I felt an ocean breeze of sorts and sure enough I did. Walking down the street, I was treated to a wonderful view of the water and mountains. Downtown Seattle was an easy 5-6 miles away.   We loved being in such a calm, quiet neighborhood. It was also close to\\r\\nseveral fun places to eat (breakfast, lunch and dinner)! \\r\\nWe appreciated all the information about places to see, how to get around and the nice touches to make us feel very welcome!!!\\r\\nHope to come back again next year!   Great little cottage. My wife and I stayed here for a weekend getaway and couldn\\'t have asked for better hosts. The cottage had everything we needed and bed was comfy as well. Location is great too, as it\\'s within walking distance to a lot of things. Downtown is just a quick 15 minute drive away as well. We would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended little cottage with great hosts in a great neighborhood.  Brad and Liz were friendly and helpful with directions, suggestions of places to eat, and any requests we had.  Plus, there were cool cats for petting in the lovely garden.  The only issue we had was a somewhat flakey wi-fi connection, though Brad was super attentive in dealing with this.  We look forward to staying again next time. Brad & Liz were perfect hosts, and we couldn\\'t have been happier with the \"home away from home\" we found in their Ballard cottage.  We enjoyed our walks through the neighborhood to nearby cafes and shops, and it was easy to hop a bus downtown.  The cottage is beautiful inside & out with all the artwork and surrounding gardens.  We had lovely weather during our visit and ran into Brad & Liz in the garden often, and really enjoyed chatting with them.  We highly recommend their Ballard cottage & hope we can stay with them again in the future. This is a comfortable cottage and I was happy to see and smell the beautiful garden as previous visits were in late fall. Brad amd Liz are friendly hosts. It is pretty quiet for the city and they provide a very comfortable bed and pillows. I highly recommend their Ballard cottage. The cottage is a lovely place that was extraordinarily convenient for me--an extra blessing. It had everything I needed including fascinating artwork to look at as it\\'s Liz\\'s studio. There was even a lovely kitty who visited with me when I sat on the patio in the morning. I was able to walk the maybe 4 blocks to a gardens and the locks and watch salmon swimming even. It was a great stay.  It is a great place for respite  We were concerned the futon wouldn\\'t fit my husband he is 6\\'3 but it was very comfortable for both of us.  We would certainly return when in town.  \\r\\n\\r\\n  Cute, quiet cottage and fantastic location! The owners are friendly and the cottage is filled with beautiful paintings and sculptures! There are also some very friendly cats that come by now and again. Definitely not a hotel, cob webs here and there, but super convenient if you want to stay in Ballard! The futon was pretty good and we stayed for 4 nights. Clean sheets and towels, but the rest of the place could use a once over. Would give it 3.5 stars if that was an option on here. All in all, pretty good deal for the money and fantastic deal for the location! Perfect spot. Host are so kind. Loved living surrounded by amazing art and a chance to be in a great part of Seattle.  Will return. We had a great time here. My boyfriend and I went to a wedding this weekend and were looking for a nice quiet and romantic place to stay that was outside of downtown. This place was perfect!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was clean, cosey, quiet and in a very great location. (only a ten min walking distance from downtown Ballard). I had some reserves about the futon and one of the previous reviews about it being like an icebox in the winter...But the futon was really a comfy bed and  there were two space heaters that heated the room just nicely. Liz and Brad were great and very accommodating. We\\'ll be back again! Brad and Liz\\'s cottage provided me a perfect pied-a-terre for a week In one of Seattle\\'s most lively neighborhoods. As other guests have noted, the bed is very comfortable and the environs are serenely quiet. It is wonderful to have your own space separate from the main house. You can come and go as you please without fear of disturbing anyone. Brad and Liz are close at hand if you need anything, but otherwise don\\'t intrude. Downtown Ballard is a 5 to 10 minute walk away, with a wide assortment of shops and restaurants. There are frequent bus connections to downtown and the university district. The microwave, mini-fridge and electric kettle make it easy to fix your own breakfast before setting off in the morning. I found the 2 space heaters worked quite well in keeping the cottage warm and cozy in mid-November when the outside temperature was in the low to mid 40 degrees.\\r\\n This is a great little cottage. It\\'s located right in the heart of Ballard and you can easily explore the neighborhood from its location. Brad and Lisa are friendly and accommodating - but also leave you to your privacy. It was very easy to check in and out and I would definitely stay there again. I only wish my stay had been longer. It\\'s a lovely cottage in a charming setting: there\\'s a grape arbor and garden, and you can hear distant ship\\'s horns now and then. Having Liz\\'s artwork and works-in-progress in the space made it feel like a real home, not just a rental unit. The cottage is nicely appointed; lots of luxurious warm comforters, and very good heating. \\r\\n\\r\\nBrad & Liz were warm and authentically welcoming hosts; I really felt they enjoy what they do, as hosts. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely stay here again on another Seattle visit.  Brad and Liz were very welcoming and kind.  The studio is a really beautiful, amazing space.  I love Liz\\'s paintings and sculpture., and the atmosphere in the studio is phenomenal.   UNfortunately, I have chemical sensitivities and had a reaction to the fabric softener they use in their laundry, which caused me to cut my visit short.  Most people would probably not have this issue at all, but anyone with chemical sensitivities might want to let the Severtson\\'s know ahead of time, and be aware of this. Awesome little cottage!  It was perfect for my stay in Seattle.  Surrounded by great art, feng shway all the way!!  Super convenient to downtown.  All the privacy I could ever want and very friendly hosts who invited me in for dinner one night! This was a very fortunate find. Ballard is a great neighborhood with tons of  restaurants, bars and coffee shops and the cottage is just a couple of minutes walking from the neighborhood center. The cottage itself is beautiful: complete a nice little kitchenette, interesting books, mini-fridge and anything else that you might need. The hosts were great too! Brad and Liz are wonderful hosts -- we loved our comfortable artist studio nestled into their pretty garden.  Great access to beautiful Ballard and all it has to offer! The pluses are: very friendly and accomodating hosts, convenience to many Seattle satellite neighborhoods, very private, spacious, quaint, filled with art and comfortable futon bed.\\r\\nThe minuses: musty odor, strong dryer fragrance, cold tile floors that heat up slowly with free standing heaters, need for thorough cleaning and some basic upgrading. Cats are lovely but beware if you are allergic. Great place!\\r\\n\\r\\n- Brad and Liz were great!\\r\\n- The bed/futon was very comfortable\\r\\n- The area, Ballard, is a lovely area that is a lot more relaxed than downtown (but not that far away)\\r\\n- There is a great supermarket close, making eating a lot cheaper\\r\\n- The space in general is pretty great, loadsa art everywhere, far more interesting than your average accommodation.\\r\\n- Solid (but not amazingly fast) internet\\r\\n- They have 2 lovely cats that love to keep you company!\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a great stay in the cottage, highly recommended.  We came for a romantic couple of days and were well pleased. The cottage was private, charming, beautifully decorated with Liz\\'s inspiring art. We brought our bikes since it is convenient to many scenic places, and the cats provided entertainment.  Brad was a dear to deal with. We feel very lucky and had a great time.  There was even a record player! My daughter and I had a terrific stay at Brad an Liz\\'s backyard cottage.  The space was roomy and comfortable and extras such as teas and cups, cutlery, a small fridge and microwave were perfect for or needs.  We asked Brad for dining suggestions and his recommendations were the best! The cabin is so lovely and cozy! The futon was very comfortable, and the heat was adjustable and warm. The garden is so cute, and Brad was a lovely host.  We look forward to returning often! My husband and I loved staying in this wonderful cottage.  The location was perfect, Brad and Liz are amazing hosts, and the cottage was a great space for us.  The garden/patio area is perfect for soaking up the sun, enjoying the wonderful flowers, and unwinding from the day.  Thanks for sharing your cottage with us and we plan on returning! Brad and Liz are amazing hosts: courteous, kind, knowledgable, and friendly. Brad reached out nearly a week before our stay and was a constant source of advice throughout. I\\'m glad I trusted his bar/drink suggestions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pictures on the listing page don\\'t do the cottage justice. It\\'s simply the coziest 300-400 square feet imaginable. It might look small - like a shared space - but it\\'s not. It\\'s absolutely plenty of space for one or two people who need a home base from which to explore Ballard.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy biggest gripe about my stay would have to be the wireless internet. Unavailable the first evening, it was spotty every night thereafter. This wasn\\'t something that Brad/Liz knew about before our arrival, and it wasn\\'t something that was \"fixed\" by the end of our stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn lieu of a reliable connection, Brad let us work from within his house - where Brad made us coffee and let us borrow a handful of movies. It was a very reasonable alternative to constant access. Still, as someone who works from his laptop, I admit that I didn\\'t get as much done in the evenings as I would have liked.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that said, I wouldn\\'t hesitate to recommend this place to friends and stay there again once the wireless is back in action! My girlfriend and I stayed at Brad and Liz\\'s cottage for 4 nights and we LOVED it!  The space was quaint, clean, comfortable and private.  Brad and Liz were easy to communicate with, incredibly kind, and offered great suggestions for things to do in the Ballard area (downtown and \\'old\\' Ballard are only blocks away!).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe definitely plan on staying at Brad and Liz\\'s cottage again during our next trip to Seattle. The cottage is our choice every time we visit Seattle, and will recommend it to friends and family! Thank you Brad and Liz for providing such a lovely retreat! I stayed with Brad and Liz when I was visiting Seattle for a couple of days with my boyfriend.  The cottage was wonderful.  We had everything we needed, and the neighborhood was fantastic.  Brad and Liz gave us some great tips about the area, and their basket of maps was very helpful for finding our way around the city.  Also, the sweet cats were a big plus.  It was a great stay. We stayed at the Cottage in Ballard for the Solstice Parade in Freemont last weekend and had a great time!  Brad & Liz are wonderful hosts, which we believe is paramount! (Not that the futon wasn\\'t extremely comfortable, with satiny cotton sheets and plenty of towels etc.,)  We had a dilemma with our car window not closing, and Brad immediately went to his workshop for duct tape and plastic! Ballard is a fabulous community to stroll through, with plenty of great restaurants and shops. The farmers market is also interesting. It was fun staying in a residential neighbourhood, in a charming heritage style home/artist\\' cottage, and meeting Brad and Liz.    A great little studio cottage - set beautifully on a quiet street beside a home that is very obviously a labor of love. Brad and Liz were helpful and accommodating. We\\'ll be back soon.  Brad & Liz\\'s garden cottage was lovely! My husband and I were surrounded by inspiring art, lush gardens, and friendly cats. Brad and Liz are gracious hosts and we had a great time chatting about the city and their fascinating projects. Also, Ballard is a rad place to stay!  We really enjoyed staying here.  The place was charming and comfortable, and Brad and Liz were great hosts.  Be sure to ask them to recommend restaurants! Highlights were our kind hosts, a tidy and inspiring cottage, and a vibrant community. The bed is comfy, the space is charming with all of Liz\\'s sculptures and paintings, and Brad had plenty of neighborhood suggestions for us to enjoy.  Cottage was exactly as it appears in the listing.  Very comfortable.  Brad and Liz were excellent hosts. The reservation was canceled 41 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. We loved the cottage and the Ballard neighborhood! The cottage had everything we needed without being fussy. It truly felt like home away from home. The futon is surprisingly comfortable, Liz\\'s art and gardens are inspiring, and the cats are friendly. It\\'s an easy walk to Ballard\\'s main drag, which had plenty of restaurants, pubs, and shops to keep us busy for a week, and a short drive to other neighborhoods, including downtown Seattle.  We\\'ll definitely stay here again when we\\'re back in Seattle! I can\\'t imagine a better place to stay in the Seattle area!  The Ballard District has become a center of superb food and drink, with a number of great choices ranging from a French cafe, funky bars and fine dining.  Several convenient options for mass transit make other parts of the city easily accessible.  But, most importantly, Brad and Liz are the perfect hosts; they made me feel immediately welcomed.  The accommodations--the Cottage--is a very comfortable space, surrounded by an amazing garden.  On a more practical note: it could not be more reasonably priced--an incredible value! The cottage is great, and Brad and Liz were lovely! We loved staying there, surrounded by Liz\\'s art. It was very comfy - we only wished we had more time to just enjoy the cottage and the beautiful gardens! We enjoyed downtown Ballard and the locks as well. It\\'s a really neat part of the city. We would definitely go back (and stay here). This was probably my best AirBNB experience yet. Brad and Liz were great hosts who made me feel at home from the minute I arrived, and the cottage is a truly beautiful space. Despite being 5 minutes from downtown Ballard, it feels as remote and private as one could ask for. \\r\\n\\r\\nWill definitely stay here again next time I\\'m in Seattle. I recommend the cottage for anyone else visiting the city who wants a unique and relaxing experience.  A lovely property; a very comfortable space. Brad and Liz are welcoming, kind, lively hosts (who look ten years younger than their photo). Very much enjoyed exploring Ballard Ave. Easy trip from the airport, or back downtown to museums, ferries etc. It was great having a peaceful place to return to at the end of the day. Brad and Liz were the perfect host. Very approachable, giving, and quite helpful. The cottage is absolutely lovely, and the garden was probably one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Also the cottage is in a prime location, very close to downtown Ballard, and to bus stations that can take you anywhere your heart could desire. Loved, loved, loved it, and would highly recommend if you are coming to Seattle to stay with these guys. Couldn\\'t have asked for anything more, thank you!!  The cottage was absolutely charming and perfectly situated for our visit with our son who lives in Ballard. We were able to walk to the Lake Washington locks, several wonderful coffee cafes, our son\\'s apartment and Ballard\\'s Farmers\\' Market on Sunday, among other things!\\r\\nBrad and Liz were wonderful...responded quickly to emails and texts and met us at the cottage when we arrived to show us around.  In fact if there was any disappointment, it was that because we were so busy with our son, we didn\\'t get to see and get acquainted with Liz and Brad as much as we\\'d have liked :0)\\r\\nWe\\'ll definitely stay there again the next time we visit!\\r\\n I had an incredibly peaceful time at Brad & Liz\\'s lovely cottage.  It was absolutely comfortable, easy, private, clean and with the great vibe of all of Liz\\'s art.  Really great place...they were fantastic although we didn\\'t see much of each other but everything felt so easy and mellow.  Thank you both and I will absolutely see you again!  Hi to my little friend, Jasper who greeted me nightly upon my arrival!   Absolutely loved my stay at the cottage! Liz and Brad are delightful, and I can\\'t wait to see them again the next time I\\'m in Seattle! :) This place is wonderful-just as it was listed and just as the photos show.  There is a superlatively friendly cat that came calling a few times, the garden is lovely and Brad and Liz extremely nice.  Perfect! Everything we hoped for. Nice, clean private space in a great neighborhood. Brad & Liz were super-nice, friendly and respectful. Would definitely recommend and stay again.  I had a wonderful stay!  Great location! An easy place to hunker down in to during a rainy Seattle stay, this little bungalow is simply a sweet spot! Brad and Liz both offered engaging conversation. Very accomplished folks and impressively creative with their hobbies and home, I shall definitely look to book here again. Nearby places to eat like the Portage Bay cafe topped my time in Seattle with tasty indulgence and then a nice little walk to the Locks complemented my start on the day. Highly recommended! This was the perfect spot for me\\r\\nI love Ballard and the guesthouse is cozy and comfy and filled with Liz\\'s beautiful artwork\\r\\nit was like staying with friends\\r\\nThey are both charming, warm, available and fantastic hosts\\r\\n\\r\\nNext time Im coming withou the rain to enjoy sitting in the gardens! We stayed with Brad and Liz for two nights Nov 1&2, and we could not have been happier!  The cottage is Liz\\' studio, a separate building in back of their home; it\\'s really wonderful, full of her clay sculptures and various assorted works of art.  Nice comfy bed, coffee maker, micro and little fridge; all the comforts of home.  The location is ideal, on a super quiet residential street in Ballard neighborhood, about 45 blocks north of downtown, and a few blocks from great restaurants, shopping, Crittenden Locks and Shilshole Bay and it\\'s marina.  Because it\\'s a separate living area, we only met Brad for a few minutes when we arrived, but he was pleasant and helpful.  Highly recommend this place; we hope to stay with them on our next trip up to Seattle. Charming cottage in a great location!  Would stay here again!  We had a fine stay in the cottage.  It was clean and cozy. Brad and Liz have created a fine space for guests.  The cottage is conveniently located for exploring Ballard. Easity accessible to the rest of Seattle. We particularly enjoyed morning walks to nearby Discovery Park.  I would recommend the cottage to interested travelers. Super cute and perfect location.   Completely \"as advertised\".  Brad made it all super easy.  Would stay here again!     My son and grandson stayed at the cottage over Thanksgiving holidays, while I stayed with my daughter who lives 3 blocks away.  All of us felt the cottage was perfect for what we needed- a good, clean space to stay but had the big plus of the ambiance of Ballard!  It was cozy and nice.   This was the perfect place for me to stay.  I took the bus into Seattle, then the ferry to Bainbridge Island and spent most of the day.  What a lovely trip on a sunny winter day.  My host\\'s restaurant recommendation worked perfectly after an afternoon at the Chihuly Glass Museum.  Seattle is just really cool, lots to do, and beautiful to look at.  I hope to go back frequently, and enjoy the cottage often. Staying at Brad and Liz\\'s cottage was a pleasure. The location was great, Brad and Liz were very helpful and friendly. The space was clean and quiet with a comfy bed and clean towels... all we needed for our weekend away. We would definitely stay again if we make another stop to Ballard. Just as advertised, cozy studio.  Great location, walking distance to Ballard\\'s restaurants, quiet neighborhood.  Would stay here again without hesitation.  I really loved the art studio cottage.  The bed was so comfortable, I slept like a baby!  8 or 9 hours each nite - for 8 nites!  The weather was cold, so I was under the blankets, snuggled into the pillows.  \\r\\nThe art, so beautiful, was really a special feature.  The cottage is the right size for 1 or 2 people.\\r\\nIt was where I wanted to be, close to Ballard to walk to dinner, take in the downtown.\\r\\nI\\'d love to come back in spring/summer to see the gardens.  Brad and Liz, great hosts, there when you need them, but lots of privacy.  Thank you! Such a great space!  Comfy, relaxing and cute!  Brad and Liz were great hosts leaving us with such nice amenities as big fluffy towels, great coffee and tea, refrigerator for our local baked bread, and Jasper, the most friendliest of cats.  Loved Ballard, what a great area too with small shops, local bakeries, bars and restaurants.  Don\\'t forget the Sunday Ballard market!\\r\\nThanks! Nonpareil. I have never rested so comfortably away from home. The bed was a dreamscape, and I appreciated the excellent reading lamp that allowed me to sink into slumber beneath the shade of a good book. From the bedstead to the kitchenette to the bathroom, there was a broad and anticipatory array of amenities, but even without the blackberry sage tea and electric kettle (to boot), the place was a sanctuary of the highest order to which I nightly looked forward to retiring. The furniture, the artwork, the books, and the pillows created a calm and regenerative atmosphere which alone was worth the trip to Seattle---never mind that I had come to work!. That it was in the heart of Ballard (Seattle\\'s Lilttle Scandinavia) still has me swooning.\\r\\nMoreover, my hosts were warm and welcoming, and I look forward to visiting with them again one day. Very pleasant small cottage with privacy and responsive hosts. A unique and refreshing stay- I did a mini writer\\'s retreat in their nicely crafted cottage art studio in Ballard. Surrounded by sculptures and work in progress, this was just the place for tuning in with my Muse. Nearby cafes and the Golden Garden Beach were nice walking breaks too. Their two curious cats added an amusing note.  Thanks again Brad & Liz!!   I had a wonderful stay at your Cottage!!   As all the other reviewers have said, this spot is just perfect. It has to be the best AirBnB deal in Seattle. We stayed two nights on a mix of work and play, and this was a great spot for both. Everything in the cottage is just as advertised (or better). It was comfortable and cozy, and Brad and Liz were very welcoming, as were their friendly cats. Plus, Ballard is a great area to explore and not a far drive from other good spots in the city.  Beautiful little cottage, so cozy and perfect!\\r\\nThe art is absolutely amazing and wonderful to enjoy while you are there and almost gives you the feel of being in Paris and how you would imagine an artists studio to be. Lovely!\\r\\nAnd the kitties make great hosts and are always willing to cuddle with you.\\r\\nI had a relaxing, comfortable vacation! Thank you Brad & Liz. :)\\r\\n\\r\\nKris.  Wonderful spot. Quiet, comfy, cozy Great bed. Slept well. Walking distance from great food spots. Highly recommend.  Lovely cottage in a gorgeous area.  We love Ballard and will be back!! The cottage was beautiful, a working artist studio and retreat, very quiet, and a nice place to stay. Flexible time arrangements, very easy. Would rebook another time and looking forward to get to know Brad and Liz a little bit. Street parking was easy and plentiful.  A great little place in my favorite location in Seattle. A splendid little Ballard gem.  I\\'m from the Seattle area and just wanted to give a visiting friend a taste of what the different neighborhoods have to offer.  Brad and Liz\\'s place was a great choice for Ballard: they were great hosts, totally relaxed and knowledgeable; the location was fantastic; and the cottage itself was so comfy - even (or especially) on a rainy April weekend. Had a brief but lovely stay at this wonderful little cottage. Brad and Liz were kind and welcoming. The cottage was filled with the wonderful creations of Liz and it was a very comfortable space. The futon was quite comfortable and we were plenty warn despite the cool spring weather. Good walking distance to nice shops and restaurants. I would certainly recommend this little cottage. Perfect option for staying in Ballard. Easy walk everywhere, accommodations were very clean, and the neighborhood very safe. Hosts were super mellow, only saw Brad once but he kept in touch to make sure we had everything we needed. Southwest lost our luggage and didn\\'t get it to us for a day and half. Brad offered us warm clothes since we had only light jackets after flying in from Florida. Very kind folks. Overall great stay, would and most likely will stay again. What a wonderful stay Eddy and I had in Seattle.  By good fortune, we ended up in the Ballard district, the heart of  the downtown with brick roads and repurposed beautiful buildings from the 19th C within walking distance from the cottage.  A great farmer\\'s market on Sunday, so many restaurants and coffee shops,  Ballard is perhaps our favorite district in Seattle.  The cottage was hard to say \"good bye\" to, colorful, cozy, comfortable, well-located. Brad and Liz are super hosts, friendly and helpful.  We highly recommend a stay with Brad and Liz.   We enjoyed our 3 night stay in Brad and Liz\\'s cottage very much.  The furnishings are very comfortable and the art is truly incredible and inspiring.  Since we visited during an early May heat wave, we also appreciated being able to sit outside in the lush spring garden.  Cats Jasper and Lilly made us feel right at home too!  We highly recommend the Salmon Bay Cafe for breakfast....you won\\'t need to eat again until dinner.   Wonderful hosts! Perfect cozy space and area of town! The art all around us was an added bonus. Loved getting to know Liz & Brad and would definitely stay again! I stayed eight days this month ( May) in Liz and Brad\\'s cottage and had a wonderful time. This cottage is charming! It\\'s situated in a sweet-smelling, beautiful garden that was, happily, in bloom during my stay, on a lovely Ballard Street. An easy walk to downtown Ballard and very close to the locks. The cottage has been thoughtfully appointed--I had everything I needed and more. It\\'s also lovely to stay in the midst of Liz\\'s artwork, which gives the cottage a unique, personal feel. I\\'ll definitely stay here again. We had a lovely stay here! I appreciated the privacy and cozy atmosphere of the cottage, and having visits from Jasper (the cat) added to the homey feel. Brad and Liz provided great information about the neighborhood, and Ballard is totally delightful! Would happily stay here again when I return to Seattle! Thanks Brad and Liz - we enjoyed our stay in your secluded, cozy garden escape (aka studio). It was the perfect base from which to explore Ballard and Seattle. On our trip down the American west coast we were lucky enough to start off at a really special place - Liz\\'s and Brad\\'s garden was just as magical as expected, we were blessed with beautiful weather and we liked Ballard actually more than downtown Seattle! We loved being there, a romantic and peaceful to charge your batteries after the big city buzz, which is pretty much right around the corner! (great to explore the open mic\\'s and music scene of Seattle...) Brad and Liz were great hosts and helped us out as much as they could, it felt more like staying with friends than actually being hosted by complete strangers ;-)  Brad and Liz were super cool, nice, and accommodating.  Great, private, and interesting space.  Would stay again! Wonderful little artist cottage!!!!!!  Close to everything: restaurants, stores, downtown Seattle and water front. We enjoyed our stay very much. Brad was great to answer any questions we had about the area and make suggestions as to places to eat. Brad & Liz sind hervorragende Gastgeber, warmherzig, freundlich und hilfsbereit. So hatten wir einen schönen Start in unseren Nordwest-Urlaub. Wir verbrachten 2 Nächte im sehr interessanten Cottage mit  den tollen Skulpturen und Bildern von Liz. Das Cottage liegt in Ballard in einer ruhigen Wohngegend und doch ist das Stadtzentrum mit dem Auto schnell zu erreichen.\\r\\nVielen Dank Liz und Brad für die schöne Zeit. What a wonderful little cottage. This was our first use of air b&b and it gave us a great impression. Brad and Liz were very pleasant, and gave helpful recommendations about places to eat in the area. We wish we got to spend more time talking with them but we were too busy exploring Seattle! Location is great and the cottage is cozy and comfortable. Would suggest this place to all friends passing through Seattle. Thanks brad and Liz!! My husband and I stayed in Brad and Liz\\'s artists cottage for two nights, and it was great! The cottage is charming and we had everything we needed. It was fun to explore Ballard, and the neighborhood was great for running, with a path by the water just a few blocks away. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at the Walrus and the Carpenter as well!  Brad and Liz´s cottage is truly a special place and Ballard a great neighborhood on top. We can highly recommend it to everyone! In addition, Cafe Besola (French patisserie), which is in walking distance, offers definitely the best Latte and Quiche in town.    We had a lovely time at brad and Liz\\'s cottage. The bed was super comfy, everything was spotlessly clean, and all the art gives the place immense personality and charm. And Ballard is awesome! The Sunday farmers market was great fun, and we had some wonderful meals in the neighborhood.  We had a great time! Very quaint, comfortable studio in the heart of Ballard with easy access to public transportation and highway.  Liz and her daughter were excellent hosts. Highly recommended!! The Cottage in the heart of Ballard was a wonderful place to stay. Brad and Liz (and daughter Rachael) were very conscientious about being easily reachable. The cottage was cozy and covered in beautiful artwork, the bed was comfy, and everything was clean. The stay was perfect. Brad and Liz were very helpful and prompt at communicating,  We reserved their cottage for our friends who were visiting from outside America, and they felt very well taken care of by their hosts.  The cottage is located behind the main house, with plenty of privacy and very quiet.  Our friends reported that they were very happy with the accommodations, and thoroughly enjoyed their stay! Where to begin! This was the most perfect little cottage getaway. Brad came out to greet us upon arrival and was very helpful with eating recommendations as well as things to do and see in the Ballard area. The cottage itself was immaculate, with Liz\\'s gorgeous art sprinkled throughout. Such great vibes! We had sweet kitty visitors, and the neighborhood was lovely to walk around within. We were sad to leave and wish our stay could\\'ve been longer. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfy, relaxing stay in Seattle.  Our stay at Brad and Liz\\'s cottage was perfect. It was clean, warm, comfortable, and they have water, tea and a small fridge which were all very much appreciated. The artwork and sculptures in the cottage were outstanding. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately we never had the chance to meet Brad or Liz. We were there for a baptism so our days were long and full. I look forward to staying with them again sometime! What a great place in a perfect location! As a Seattle native I knew that Ballard is a wonderful place to stay. The cottage is in the perfect location, you can walk to so many great restaurants/bars/parks, etc. Liz and Brad were amazing hosts, as were their two kitties. Definitely recommend this cottage to anyone exploring the Seattle area!\\r\\n Brad & Liz are fantastic!!!\\r\\nMy wife Monica and I want to add a huge pile of flowers onto the already huge pile of positive reviews of there place... and them!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are looking for a great place with great people....this is it!!\\r\\nA review I read before staying at there place said \"this is the best Airbnb place to stay in Seattle\"\\r\\nI want to repeat that statement...\"This is the best Airbnb place to stay in Seattle!!!!!!\"\\r\\nMy sister lives in (email hidden)d my wife and I plan to visit again. When we return...we plan to stay with Brad and Liz\\r\\nLes & Monica\\r\\n   Brad and Liz had a beautiful cottage, it was very private and comfortable with all of the amenities needed to make it a beautiful trip. The place was clean and inviting with amazing sculptures and other art from Liz. Highly recommended and would love to stay again in the future. This was the first time that we used Airbnb and had a wonderful stay in Brad and Liz\\'s cottage.  It\\'s very comfortable, quiet, convenient  and great hosts!  It was everything we had desired!  We hope to stay here again whenever we are able to get back to Seattle! The Cottage is adorable and was just the right size for the two of us.  We had the opportunity to meet both Brad and Liz and found them to be very welcoming and friendly.  The parking is on the street, but we never had any issues finding a spot right by the house.  I would highly recommend this location to any other prospective airbnbers out there.   Our stay at this cottage/studio in Ballard couldn\\'t have been better. The accommodations were very comfortable, we were surrounded by beautiful paintings and sculptures (the guest room doubles as a studio), and our hosts had superb eating and drinking recommendations in the area. I strongly recommend staying here. This cozy cottage in Ballard provided exactly the getaway we were looking for. A quiet, beautiful, and conveniently located place. Brad & Liz were wonderful hosts with great recommendations for sights and dining. Their cats were lovely companions as well. Highly recommended. Lovely cottage in a beautiful setting!  It was great \"coming home\" every night after a full day out and about.  I had the pleasure of meeting Brad and Liz and feeling their warm welcome.  I wholeheartedly recommend this cottage and wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay there again.  Thank you, Liz and Brad! Really comfortable bed. Quiet. Tiny space but very suitable for using primarily to sleep. Stayed for a weekend with my girlfriend and we had a great time at the cottage. Only got to meet Brad once but he seemed really great and his friend who checked us in was very amicable as well. The bed was really comfortable and the actual cottage itself was warm and cozy. The neighborhood was amazing and easily one of the quietest places I\\'ve ever visited. Everything was within walking distance. Wifi signal was a little weak but we really didn\\'t have much use for it either way. Overall, an amazing stay. Our first trip to Seattle was beautiful thanks to these two hosts! Warmth and hospitality is what we were greeted with and shown our entire stay! Loved the cottage! It was a warm & cozy place for us to return to after exploring the city! Will be recommending their place to friends and family who travel to Seattle! Brad and Liz are great hosts.  Thoughtful and caring.  Their cottage is warm and comfortable, quiet and private.  I very much enjoyed my stay and appreciated the location.   Fantastic place to stay! Brad was a great host, very welcoming and informative. The cottage is extremely comfortable and in a great location, close to the shops and restaurants in Ballard. I highly recommend staying here!  Oh man Brad & Liz have a great guest house! They\\'re in a cool part of Ballard next to stuff, the place is clean and decorated with Liz art, he welcomed us and gave a run-down of the town. We were free to come and go as we pleased after that. Very comfortable stay, would bunk here again in a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Brad & Liz! I loved staying in the Cottage. It was super cute, very comfortable, and wonderfully quiet. Brad and Liz were communicative and amenable, but the Cottage has a lot of privacy.  We took a quick last-minute trip to Seattle and were lucky enough to have a few nights in Brad & Liz\\'s great guest house. The location is fantastic - walking distance to a ton of shops and awesome restaurants in Ballard and Brad had some fantastic recommendations for places to eat and things to do. The guest house space is so warm and welcoming. Great neighborhood, great hosts. Thanks for having us! My sister and I had a great stay in this cottage, and Brad, Liz and Rachel were all very friendly and accommodating. We were especially grateful for the sink, tea kettle, microwave and little fridge to store our snacks in. We shopped, ate and watched the Superbowl excitement in downtown Ballard... awesome weekend! Would definitely recommend.  Brad and Liz were fantastic hosts! Easy to communicate with, accommodating and just really neat people. This is what I love about airbnb, not only do you get to stay someplace really comfortable, you also get to meet cool people! Thank you for a wonderful place to stay, I\\'m already looking forward to my next visit. We had a wonderful time at The Cottage. Very cozy, clean, furnished with the basics. Situated in a nice neighborhood, close to shops and restaurants. The hosts, Liz and Brad, were great! I highly recommend staying at their lovely cottage. This place is as described, privacy, great location, good plumbing, and a host who responds quickly to text. We found the mattress comfortable and the pillows are many and very comfortable. If you book here, read the instructions given sent to you in the confirmation e-mail...it will tell you where the light switches are (the second room is not easy to find on your own). The location is excellent and within 3 blocks of bus service. We rented bicycles for our stay. The trails are close and convenient for city cycling (cars yield to bicycles and pedestrians). Liz and Brad were out of town for our trip so their daughter Rachael was our gracious host. We absolutely would stay here again. I had a great stay at Brad and \\r\\nLiz\\'s cottage. Private and very  comfortable and perfect location for me.  I love the Ballard area and it is very close to friends and family. Unfortunately Brad and \\r\\nLiz were on vacation so I did not get to see them.  I actually know Brad from high school and would love to meet Liz who based on the work in the cottage a very talented artist. On street parking could not have been easier, would love to stay here again,\\r\\n We had a very comfortable and snug two days at Brad\\'s and Liz\\'s studio in Ballard. I loved the location - convenient to everything, but so quiet. The garden patio is inviting, wish it had been spring, not winter and rainy!  It will be so pretty then.  Didn\\'t get to meet Liz and only said  \"Hello\" to Brad as he was riding off to work on his bike!  Maybe next time we can connect.  The family cats are friendly and fun.  And we did get to meet Rachael, their sweet college-aged daughter.  She was very helpful and available. This little spot was perfect! Great cozy cottage and perfect location. Brad and Liz provide you with all the things you need to make ones stay charming. AND You can walk any to the best bakery in Seattle! My time at Brad and Liz\\' cottage was a perfect escape. They were warm and welcoming when I arrived and my three days in their studio/home were wonderful. The cottage is the perfect distance to and from the heart of Ballard. If you are looking to escape and have a quiet retreat, then this place is for you. If you are looking to immerse yourself in Ballard\\'s myriad restaurants and bars, then this place is for you. The commute is quick and safe. I would definitely come stay here again. Hell, yeah! Beautiful house, gorgeous residential neighborhood a couple miles from downtown, an easy jog to the water (I took a jog). My 2d day, hosts invited me in for an evening cocktail -- a sage martini, with gin and crushed sage and vermouth. No joke. This was my first AirBnB experience, and it makes me think that this is a great way to go. Fantastic location. Lovely space filled with beautiful art. Delightful hosts. I was in Seattle on business and the space to care of all my needs.  The little studio is a lovely place to stay, and the hosts are very welcoming. I really enjoying waking up to Liz\\'s sculptures every day and Brad was always forthcoming with suggestions about the neighbourhood, which we loved. I would definitely stay here again.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the artist\\'s cottage.  It was comfortable, cozy, and we enjoyed being surrounded by art.  The friendly cats in the yard were always there to greet us and to say goodbye.  We also enjoyed eating at several restaurants in walking distance.  Would love to come back when it is not raining to enjoy the lovely yard too. Brad and Liz were great hosts and the space was cozy and convenient. Would highly recommend. \\r\\n Cozy and comfortable.  affordable and private. Brad and Liz are wonderful hosts and their cottage is a delight:: quiet and comfortable. And their garden is beautiful too. We would definitely stay there again if we return to Seattle  Delightful, comfortable, homey, artistic, private space in a really great neighborhood.  Gorgeous garden!  Welcoming, friendly hosts.  We would love to come back! Cozy affordable clean private -- and where else can you stay surrounded by lovely clay sculptures and painted scenery?  Great neighborhood of arts and crafts style homes.  Views of the Puget Sound and lots of bakeries/cafes within walking distance.   This beautiful cottage was exactly what my girlfriend and I needed! It is cozy yet spacious with a comfortable bed and great art work covering the walls. The surrounding garden and patio looked great as well but we didn\\'t get a chance to use it due to the rain. Brad was very friendly and more than helpful telling us about some things to check out in Seattle during our visit. I would recommend the cottage to anyone and hope to go back soon!  Thanks Brad & Liz! Fabulous space - we loved staying in their detached gate house in the lush back garden and being surrounded by Liz\\'s drawings and sculptures. Beautiful earth tones. Great location away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Very convenient for transit riders. Too many great eateries for one neighbourhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighly recommended. The cats are just as friendly as Brad and Liz.   First time with Airbnb, and it was perfect! Brad and Liz\\'s Cottage was a really charming place that made our stay in Ballard all the more special. Liz is an AMAZING artist, and waking up each morning in a supremely comfortable bed, surrounded by all that artistic creativity, was truly inspiring. The bed was roomy and comfortable, the amenities (microwave, French press, small fridge, cute bathroom) were convenient, and the surrounding neighborhood was easy to walk to. \\r\\nBallard has MANY wonderful little restaurants and shops all within a 10-minute walk from this location. Very peaceful neighborhood with cool vibe. Bonus: we had a chance to chat briefly with Brad & Liz throughout our stay, and they are very warm and welcoming.  We are looking forward to staying here again when we next visit Seattle. HIGHLY recommended! Brad was a very welcoming and friendly host, and he made us feel right at home. We arrived a little early, and the Cottage was just being cleaned, but Brad welcomed us in and let us relax at the table in the garden patio while he finished prepping the Cottage. The Cottage itself was just as listed, and was very comfortable and a perfect size for two people. The bed was a futon, but as the listing states, it is as comfortable as a real bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is great. It is a short walk to NW Ballard, where there are dozens of fun bars and restaurants to enjoy. Brad gave us some recommendations, and each one we tried was fantastic.  Art, flowers, privacy, quiet. Easy walking distance to restaurants and shops, the locks and botanic garden. Put them together and you have a lovely little retreat. The location is great: all the neighborhood homes are beautiful and well cared for. Short walk to restaurants and bus stops.Brad was very helpful giving us lots of local info. ; unfortunately we never met Liz, although shared her wonderful artistic accomplishments. Studio was not plush, but adequate. Brad and Liz were wonderful people,had a great stay just around the corner from my daughters house.Quite and clean cottage Liz\\'s flowers were in bloom. Neighborhood very nice,shop\\'s a short walk. Thanks Brad and Liz  Brad & Liz were amazing hosts, and the cottage was absolutely perfect for us. We stayed for three nights and used it as a base of operations while we got married down at The Canal. The cottage was comfortable, which helped us relax the night before the wedding, and had all the amenities we could ask for. The cottage had plenty of space, so on the Big Day, there was plenty of space to get a bride, five bridesmaids, and a few other people ready simultaneously. Finally, there was plenty of privacy, which was very important for us as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, Brad & Liz were always nearby if we needed anything. They even let us take some pre-wedding photos in their gorgeous garden! Overall a first-rate Airbnb experience, we could not recommend them more highly. Brad and Liz were incredibly hospitable and friendly.  They were pretty much the perfect hosts, welcoming us generously with tips and pointers about the area and visiting with us while we sat out on the patio enjoying a beer in the sunshine, but they also left us the space to quietly enjoy the privacy of their lovely, tranquil retreat from the city.  The sweet little back cottage set among the flowers and vines of the beautiful garden behind the main house was comfortable, filled with Liz\\'s sculptures and paintings, and convenient to the Ballard neighborhood, which we really enjoyed exploring.  We\\'d definitely stay here again on our next trip to Seattle! Brad & Liz have a unique space that offers a cozy respite with inspiring and relaxing touches. Their garden is wonderful in it\\'s spring blooms!  The neighborhood feels safe and is super close to all amenities. We enjoyed our stay and recommend it to all who desire to travel off the beaten path, and have a taste for creative exploration.  It was chilly weather when we stayed but with the heaters they provide the little cottage heats up quickly. The neighborhood was very well cared for and Brad and Liz were very nice.  The fouton bed with no box springs or mattress was definitely not for any one over 40.\\r\\nIt was a stretch calling it a \"queen bed\".  Coffee and an electric pot took care of breakfast.  Fortunately there was a great coffee shop six block away and the\\r\\nweather was great.  The shower was excruciatingly small.  Definitely not for the feint of heart. We enjoyed our stay in Ballard.  Brad and Liz were fantastic hosts.  The cottage had all the amenities and the property was beautiful.  We were able to walk to a couple of different bus stops so we could get around Seattle. We had a lovely time. The studio is cool and the cats where vary frendly Wonderful! Wonderful! The accommodations were clean and comfortable; hosts treated me like family; gardens added that extra feel; and location provided easy access while just far enough away from the noise and traffic. Highly recommended! Price is great for the place. Loved the house and all of the art. The garden area surrounding it is beautiful and peaceful. Brad and Liz are fabulous hosts and will make you feel right at home! It\\'s also not too far of a walk to downtown Ballard or to bus stops to get to downtown Seattle. Great location, cute cottage and laid back environment.  I couldn\\'t have picked a better spot. This cozy cottage was just what I need for a relaxing weekend away. Great location, walkable. This was my first experience using Airbnb and it was a great one.  Brad was super welcoming and the cottage was super cozy and cute.  It was perfect for our stay in Seattle. It also was easy to walk to places so that was a plus too!  I definitely recommend staying there! A restful, art-filled oasis near to coffee shops, restaurants and vintage shopping of Seattle\\'s Ballard neighborhood. We could even walk to most of the \\'hoods craft brew pubs, an extra bonus. We loved our stay, Brad and Liz were so hospitable and accommodating and we\\'ll likely stay at the Cottage on our next trip to Seattle. Thank you so much! Mark & Liz I was made very welcome and the studio was very cosy and peaceful, as was the neighbourhood. Easy access, walking distance to Ballard shops and super market.  Beautiful magical garden too!  I stayed here for a quick weekend trip, and could not be more pleased. Brad and Liz have created a lovely respite in the middle of the city - an art and light-filled little retreat in the middle of one of Seattle\\'s best neighbors. It\\'s within comfortable walking distance to the Chittenden Locks, Fremont, and dozens of fabulous restaurants. Also - quite easily accessed by public transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiz was a gracious hostess who assisted me with directions from Sea-Tac and recommendations for the best bakery I have ever been to, Cafe Besalu. I will definitely be booking this gem for my next visit to the Emerald City. This was a great spot for my 3 days in Seattle, and Brad and Liz made me feel very welcome.  Ballard is a great neighborhood! My parents were in town for a short weekend and stayed at Brand & Liz\\'s cottage. They absolutely loved the location and studio, and were thrilled to see Brad when we were at the Ballard Sunday market. It made them feel like they were in their own neighborhood. Thanks for making them feel right at home! Charming cottage in a great location.  It was well outfitted. Lots of art everywhere, both sculpture and paintings, which I enjoy.  This is my second stay there.   Brad and Liz\\'s backyard art studio & cottage is a wonderful place to stay in Ballard. They were very welcoming and full of suggestions for great restaurants. The cottage is within easy walking distance of many options for food and entertainment, as well as bus routes, so we could have left our car parked for the weekend and not even worried about driving. It was clean and cozy and had a very comfortable futon. A bonus for us was getting to hang out with their lovely cat, Jasper. What a sweetheart! We\\'d definitely love to stay here again. Brad & Liz\\'s cottage was a cozy, warm and accommodating home during our stay in Seattle filled with artwork and beautiful sculptures. Ballard is a very cool area with great small bars and restaurants and easy transport to downtown. They were easy to communicate with and their cats were adorable and welcoming. Highly recommended for your stay in the Pacific Northwest.  Chanelle and I had a wonderful time. Your cottage was the perfect landing pad for our quick trip. You all were extremely hospitable and we appreciate all the food and cocktail advice.  Great spot! Totally cozy and close to the heart of Ballard! I loved it!  The cottage was very nice.  Exactly what I anticipated based on the listing.  Brad and Liz were nice, I did not have much interaction with them due to my late arrival and working every day while there.  I would stay there again and recommend Brad and Liz\\'s spot to any friends or family. Brad was a great host and wealth of knowledge regarding Ballard, re-introducing us to a great neighborhood I hadn\\'t visited in many years.  The cottage was easily accessible, as was parking and quite comfortable.  Highly recommended for a Ballard stay. A wonderful and inspiring space. Perfect location for walking to Ballard restaurants or even just relaxing inside on a rainy day. We were fortunate enough to balance  fun an relaxation here after a couple of days hiking around the Olympic Peninsula. \\n\\nNever got to meet Liz but I sure hope to someday as I loved her art and I imagine her garden to be one of the best. Brad was incredibly friendly and accessible with lots of great neighborhood recommendations. \\n\\nOnly wish we could have stayed longer! Brad was very welcoming and related some of his life and travel experience with us. He spent time in Amsterdam where we live. We appreciated his collection of literature and his wife\\'s amazing talent as a sculpture. The studio was very nicely furnished with wood work by Brad, art and sculpture by Liz. We liked the tile floors. The bathroom is small but adequate. The coach converts into a bed that did tend to cause the occupants to drift toward the center. Privacy in the living room section was somewhat compromised by the reed blinds that allowed a view out into the yard and, we assume, into the room. The small refrigerator is located right behind the head of the bed and we had to turn it off when we wanted to sleep. We are both light sleepers. All in all, we found the room very comfortable and conveniently located close to down town Ballard. The cottage was great. Very peaceful. Brad provided tea to use in the cottage and when he realized that we were staying for the week, he bought more varieties to the cottage. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe two cats are very friendly. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was my first time staying in Ballard. It was much more relaxing than other time I had visited Seattle.  Brad called to give us directions and met us when we arrived. The cottage was clean, quiet, and had everything we needed. Very interesting to be staying in an artist\\'s studio! Brad also gave us a map and guide to the area, which we used extensively. Stoneburner cocktails for the win! Awesome place, clean, awesome location, charming quiet and what I wanted! Brad and Liz are both great and hospitable and friendly. Highly recommended and a short walk to everything that I wanted to experience. I really liked all the art and sculptures in the place. Also very easy parking in the neighborhood. What a lovely cottage and such a fantastic stay we had! it was everything and so much more than what we saw through these pictures and description online. We thoroughly enjoyed all of the art on the walls, among the books and atop the shelves. We truly felt at home here and enjoyed coming back to the cottage each night after all our fun in Seattle. Thank you so much for being such great hosts and for the recommended spots! (Stoneburner and Cafe Basalu are the favorites!)\\r\\n\\r\\nYou two are such a wonderfully interesting couple and we enjoyed meeting you both. We definitely plan to come back and look forward to chatting with you once again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you!\\r\\n~Parker & Candice Brad and Liz are such accommodating hosts - bending over backwards to make the stay work for us while they were out of town. Though we didn\\'t meet in person, they were incredibly easy to communicate with and even took the initiative to reach out and make sure everything was going smoothly. The space is very well-maintained and unique - overall a very interesting stay that I would highly recommend.  The cottage was amazing.  It was in a quiet neighborhood with plenty to do within walking distance.  The art is beautiful and gives the cottage a nice feel.  Everything was exactly as described.  The futon bed was very comfortable.  We got to meet Brad and Sam and it was very pleasant talking to them. They made us feel very welcome.  The cats were super friendly too!  Defnintely planning on coming back!  Great location, perfect little cottage, clean and cozy. We had a lovely stay at Liz and Brad\\'s.  The cottage was very comfortable, the flowers smelled divine, and Liz\\'s artwork made it an incredibly unique space bursting with creativity.  We didn\\'t get a chance to meet Liz during our brief stay, but Brad was very welcoming and recommended an incredible nearby bakery--a tip I am so grateful for!   Quaint, private, serene and oh- so - Ballard , our stay was perfect!\\r\\nThis cozy location was quiet yet close to all the things we wanted to enjoy. \\r\\nOur hosts were available yet discrete!   Highly recommended! Liz & Brad\\'s Cottage in the Heart of Ballard is a wonderful, artistic gem. Liz & Brad are perfect hosts, striking a delicate balance of warm hospitality and respect of privacy. Their artist\\'s studio is an excellent place to relax, recharge and be inspired. More than one person noted my calm demeanor this morning - all thanks to Liz, Brad and their two cats! Highly recommended to locals and world travelers alike. The cottage was amazing, exactly what was described and very homely. The art thats everywhere is so beautiful and makes the stay even more enjoyable. The two cats are very friendly and there was a great selection of tea waiting for us too.  Location was perfect, a short walk to Ballard cafes, restaurants, shops and buses downtown. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe would most defiantly recommend Brad & Liz\\'s cottage to anyone who wants a great space to chill while seeing the sights of Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany thanks guys, if we return we would not hesitate to stay again. Many thanks Liz and Brad for a wonderful introduction to Ballard and Seattle by having us stay in your cottage/art studio.\\r\\nFuton Bed very comfortable and cats jasper and lily also help create the home from home relaxing experience.\\r\\nWe hope to back one day soon again.\\r\\nBest wishes from marina and wylie x Cozy cottage in a lovely neighborhood! The sound of wind chimes and the scent of flowers in the morning was very invigorating. \\\\We had a second great visit to Brad and Liz\\' cottage in the Ballard district of Seattle.  We\\'re looking forward to a third stay. Perhaps for the owners\\' sake, we should keep this a secret, but Brad did our laundry.  Definitely above and beyond.  A charming cottage in walking distance to an historic, unique area of Seattle.    \\r\\nWe enjoyed our stay at this very artful, picturesque cottage. Brad greeted us and made sure we were familiar with the space and the general parameters of staying here. We were especially pleased to find that there was ample curbside parking for our vehicle. We felt welcomed and comfortable with the cottage. Brad was very kind.  He asked us what are plans were and what kinds of things we liked to do.  He then made excellent suggestions about where to go and what to see.  Later in our stay, we caught some rare Seattle sunshine and just talked about life and things with Brad and Liz on their porch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment itself is a treasure trove of visual and artistic stimulation.  There was always something new to discover.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcellent, excellent hosts and fantastic accomodations. The location of this place was ideal, within walking distance to a lot of great shops, restaurants, and the Ballard farmers\\' market. Brad and Liz were friendly hosts. The cottage was cosy and we enjoyed all the lovely art. Thank you for your hospitality. Rolf and Gerd My mom was visiting from Portland and this was a perfect place to stay. It was 2 blocks from our apartment. She said she slept better than she has in years, the only drawback was the small shower but she got about that. Brad and Liz were readily available and gracious.  The cottage was comfortable and Brad was very nice and accommodating. Bonus points for coming through on short notice!  Brad & Liz were an absolute delight as hosts of their airbnb in Ballard. The cottage, nestled behind their lovely home, is beautiful inside and out. The decor is artistic and unique. Everything is clean and well-maintained. They are friendly and available to answer any questions. The neighborhood is one of my favorites in the Seattle area, and there is a lot to do that is close and doesn\\'t require an intense amount of travel. The cottage is the best of both worlds of privacy without being secluded from all civilization. \\r\\n\\r\\nI will definitely book this place for every trip I make to Seattle. Brad and Liz are generous host with a amazing cottage. Their backyard has a lushes garden with friendly cats. The art is beautiful. The neighborhood is amazing. Our experience was refreshing, exciting and wonderful. Brad and Liz were amazing hosts! We went up to Seattle and stayed in their beautiful cottage for two days. It was close enough to the city and it was amazing having a cozy home base where we could just relax after a long day of playing tourist. Brad and Liz were accommodating and great hosts. There was never an issue of communication and they went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. Thank you for letting us stay in your lovely little corner of the world.  We had a wonderful stay at The Cottage. Brad and Liz were welcoming and hospitable while making the place feel like it was our own. The cottage is clean and comfortable, far enough away from the Ballard scene that it is quiet, but close enough that it is walkable without problem. We tired ourselves out eating, walking, and seeing much of Seattle, and it was lovely to know that we\\'d have a tranquil place to rest when we were done. Brad & Liz\\'s place was awesome!\\r\\nMy girlfriend and I took a trip to Seattle to scope out future homes for next year when we move there from the Midwest. Brad greeted us at the cottage and was very flexible on arrival time. He made us feel very welcome and was very helpful answering questions about Seattle. He showed us all the hot spots in Ballard which was awesome. Their garden and studio/cottage is completely gorgeous. Their cats were very friendly and cute :). Definitely would recommend staying here. Its a quick bus ride to the downtown area, and Ballard is a very nice an quite place. It\\'s a very pretty neighborhood. \\r\\n\\r\\nP.S.   Liz I loved your sculptures! I used to be really into ceramic and I envy your talent. :) Great hosts. Very friendly. Cottage is nice and clean. Would definitely stay here again.  Brad and Liz provided clear and concise entry instructions.  I found the cottage to be in a perfect location in Ballard, a place I wanted to get to know better.    The grounds are lovely and the space itself will meet all of your needs and very much makes you feel like an artist :)   I hope to stay again in future. We really enjoyed our time at the cottage. Brad & Liz were on a trip of their own, so we didn\\'t get to meet them. However, they were still responsive to my questions, as was their friend who was taking care of things while they were away. The cottage is beautiful and comfortable, and we loved Ballard! I am so glad we stayed here, and would stay here again in a heartbeat! Our stay was great in all ways - the Ballard neighborhood was so close and easy to access- great places to eat each night. Brad and Liz provide a wonderful escape into a little cottage/art studio that (if you leave the windows open) gets even better with the help of their two curious cats.\\r\\nWith all the shops and cafes around it provides everything you could need for a week, including a shower with great water pressure.\\r\\nGetting in was easy; they were on vacation themselves but one of their friends and their son took care of everything and truly made this a memorable and adorable stay. I would definitely stay here again! :D The Studio and Garden were fantastic. It was so nice to sit outside and relax in the evening. The studio had everything I needed for my stay, including parking and it was easy to get around the neighborhood to explore, eat and walk. I only met Liz and Brad briefly but they were so friendly and welcoming! Beautiful place to stay. We had a wonderful stay!! The cottage was just as described, was clean and comfortable, and very convenient. We enjoyed being walking distance to shops and restaurants in Ballard and staying in a nice quiet neighborhood just a short drive from the main sights in Seattle. Brad and Liz were very friendly and accommodating. The bed was very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again! Staying with Brad and Liz was cosy and seamless. Brad is communicative and thoughtful, having prepared everything necessary in advance for a smooth check in and check out. Location is great!

It is a quiet neighborhood and the bed was comfortable so we slept well. Brad and Liz went the extra mile for us  and we spent some time conversing. Liz is a fabulous award-winning sculptor and we enjoyed her studio a lot. The cat, Lilibelle, is very affectionate and joined us on the patio a few times. The location is perfect for enjoying Ballard. We could walk wherever we wanted to go in Ballard. Mass transit is very good and the bus stop is a few blocks away. Next time we are in Seattle we will definitely seek to stay with Brad and Liz. My fiancee and I had a great time at the cottage. Liz gave us a warm welcome, and their black cat, Jasper, made us feel right at home despite being 3,000 miles away from own beloved feline. He even stood on the sidewalk and said goodbye the morning we left! Anyway, back to the place: it\\'s nice and cozy and we loved all of Liz\\'s art. Ballard is a cool neighborhood to walk around in its own right and we had an easy time driving to downtown Seattle. I\\'d enthusiastically recommend this place to anyone looking for a quirky, unique, and comfortable stay in Seattle! Communication was easy with Brad and Liz.  They and their daughter made me feel very welcome.  And it was a fun place to stay as I was surrounded by the beautiful art works of Liz!

The garden was so beautiful and our daughter loved eating the herbs right off the plants. Sorry the mint bush is stripped clean!

The apartment is located in the best part of town within walking distance of amazing restaurants, great shops, and even a farmer\\'s market.\\n\\nAll the neighbors are really friendly but they don\\'t come close to the kindness you will be offered to by Brad & Liz.

The Chittenden Locks were well worth a visit. \\r\\nWe would stay here again: it was just the right combination of privacy and personal attention. We enjoyed our stay & thought the cottage was a great value! The location was quiet and cozy, while still walkable to the heart of Ballard. Bed was really comfortable, and once we had the space heaters going it stayed pretty warm in the cottage. Brad was very nice & helpful, and they had a bunch of city maps & info available. Great neighborhood; it is quiet, yet close to central Ballard, a very walkable location. The \\'cottage\\' is very solid and well insulated, and the bed perfectly comfortable.

It is very close to my family, so,  I plan to return - Carole Brad was very welcoming and showed us the ins and outs of the cottage, which was exactly as described. The location in Ballard is great and served as an easy home base during our trip. Bonus points for the friendly cat as well as the incredibly comfortable mattress topper - I slept like a baby! Both Brad & Liz\\'s cottage and the surrounding neighborhood are a pleasure.  The cottage is an art studio and there are drawings and sculptures, books, lots to look at.  We walked around the area in all directions; walked to the locks and the Nordic museum, plus cafes and restaurants.   Staying with Brad and Liz was a treat! The studio is a separate building from their main house, so we never felt like we were intruding or had to tiptoe. The TV and mini kitchen were a nice touch. The artsy aspect from Liz\\'s sculptures really made the whole space! Brad was a speedy communicator and everything was as described. I recommend staying here. Brad and Liz\\'s cottage was perfect.

The apartment is beautiful and Mercy made everything perfect. Thank you so much. 1. Most courteous and hospitable host family, which made us feel the rental as home away from home. Mercy even in advance picked/shopped for us our basic necessities to get us started like juice, milk, honey, tea, bread etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Central Ballard location with great neighborhood and quite location\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The condo is in excellent shape, with all facilties\\r\\n\\r\\n The host made us feel welcomed.  The neighborhood was peasant and seemed safe.  The host had great communication. We had a great stay here. The apartment is very clean and modern, the local area Ballard is great, and there is a bus from just outside going straight to Downtown. Mercy and her family were wonderful hosts, overall a great few days in Seattle. My husband and I had a wonderful time at the Plum apartment. Mercy and her family were welcoming, helpful and kind. We really enjoyed the Ballard neighborhood and exploring everything it has to offer. The apartment is downstairs from the main family house. It\\'s a good space for early birds. With two young kids the days start early. That works well for us, because we are eagles not owls. Thanks to Mercy for a wonderful stay... And for letting me borrow some nail polish  We had a wonderful two nights in the Plum Apartment. The space is super clean, modern, and bright. The neighborhood is quiet, but just two blocks from everything Ballard. Mercy stocked the fridge with breakfast goodies and made us feel very welcome. She even took the time to talk with us about her bees and garden! We definitely recommend staying here! Our stay at the Plum apt. was perfect! The space is super clean, bright and well appointed. It was very comfy and we would stay here again in a heartbeat! Thank you Mercy! We had such a great stay! The apartment is clean, beautiful, well-lit, and well-stocked. Mercy has done a great job stocking the kitchen with everything you need to actually cook, which is not always the case with rental spots. The neighborhood is really fun, with great coffee, food, biking, and shopping. But most importantly, Mercy and her family are wonderfully hospitable. They went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Can\\'t recommend this place highly enough! We stayed here for 3 nights with our toddler and absolutely loved it. The apartment is spacious, well-lit and has great amenities. A lot of thought has been put into making everything accessible and comfortable. Mercy is a great host and was available to answer all our questions. Won\\'t hesitate to stay here again. Highly recommend this place!  Our stay here was fantastic and the place was incredible.  It was as clean as can be when we arrived, and the fridge was filled with a small breakfast all set for the next morning.  The beds are comfortable and we were always able to get a good night\\'s rest. The Ballard neighborhood has a lot of great places to go to, and the location has easy access to the rest of Seattle. I would recommend this place for anyone staying in Seattle.  Mercy was so lovely to deal with.  I contacted her ahead of time to ask if she would mind setting up/making the extra bed since we would get in late and wanted a smooth transition for our kids.  She was happy to do it!  There was a tray of simple breakfast supplies waiting for us in the refrigerator, which made the next morning so easy . . . we felt pampered!  Her husband made an effort to welcome us when we crossed paths outside and asked if we needed anything as well.  The apartment was clean, easy to access, and is located in a very fun part of Ballard.  The beds were comfortable and the kids loved watching a little TV in the morning while snuggled up on the couch bed.  We will definitely come back!   The space is beautiful, light, airy, and modern. The bathroom and kitchen are gorgeous and look brand new. Everything was immaculate.  Many nice touches, like kitchen and bathroom supplies, and even a white noise machine in the bedroom. The apartment is in a quiet residential neighborhood. There are great restaurants and cafes nearby. The hosts are very friendly, considerate and professional. I would highly recommend staying here.  What a delight it was to spend our time at Mercy\\'s. This apartment is right off a main road and close to everything. The bed was so comfy I slept like a baby.\\nShe even left us coffee & yummy bread & jam for breakfast. Very good find! What a great location!  You can walk to tons of restaurants, live music, the local farmers market,  bakeries,  bars and more.   We rode our bikes from the Plum House to the Washington Park Arboretum - great fun.  The house was roomy and comfortable.   We had a great time.  Thanks Mercy! Mercy made us feel remarkably welcome.  She was a great communicator, was warm and inviting and worked with us to make sure we had everything we needed.  The place was as described, immaculate and cozy.  It was in a convenient part of town and on a beautiful lot.  There was a little noise during peak hours but that is to be expected given the set up and is indicated on the description.  It was perfectly quiet at night when it really matters so it did not affect us.  I would stay here again any time I am in Seattle. We had a wonderful time at the Plum Apartment. It was quiet, in a nice neighborhood in Ballard, and close to several restaurants and bars. We had everything we needed without needing to contact Mercy throughout our stay. It does get a little warm during the summer so keeping the windows open will cool the apartment down a bit. Would definitely stay here again. We just spent a week in the Plum Apartment.  It is exactly as described.  It is very spacious, comfortable and well stocked.  We did not have a car as it was conveniently located near our daughter\\'s apt in Ballard so did not have to deal with parking.  We did make a mess of the trash/recycling requirements and do apologize to Mercy for that.  Also, we left a pair of eye glasses in the apt and Mercy was kind enough to mail them back to us. I would definitely highly recommend these accommodations especially to environmentally conscious travelers. We highly recommend the plum apartment! My boyfriend and I recently stayed at this location for a few days on a trip to Seattle. Since I used to live in the area, I wanted to avoid the hassle of trying to maneuver downtown in prime tourist season, and Ballard has always been a favorite neighborhood of mine. Not only was the plum apartment in a beautiful area, it was within a few blocks of Ballard\\'s main street, and a short drive to the locks and Golden Gardens beach. The apartment itself was gorgeous, modern, and pristine. Mercy herself was incredibly welcoming and thoughtful-a perfect hostess! We will absolutely stay here again in the future.  Didn\\'t meet the host because the were out of town but really nice place in a great neighborhood.  Nice with busline 40 so close by, so it was easy to get to downtown in 30-40 min.\\r\\nThe apartment had everything we needed and it even had bread and coffee in the fridge. \\r\\nVery recommendable.  The accommodation at the plum apartment was completely adequate. \\nHowever, I cannot give a positive review following our present experience.\\n\\nMercy had provided the information regarding the property. She had indicated that she would be out of town and the residence above our unit would also be occupied by guests.\\n\\nI had decided to take two friends who had travelled overseas to Seattle.\\n\\nOn our first evening, we were awakened at 3am to the sound of heavy footsteps and yelling coming from the upstairs unit. The occupants upstairs had decided to throw a party on an early Monday morning. \\n\\nI went outside and noticed two individuals on the upper deck smoking marihuana. I went upstairs to advise the occupants to keep the noise level down. I had noticed approximately 11 people in the unit. All appeared to be intoxicated.\\n\\nOne of the male\\'s we spoke to had suggested that the previous guests in our unit did not mind the noise. We had asked for them to keep the noise level down, As their voices were carrying into the unit below. The male himself, was intoxicated. He merely suggested that we \\'join the party\\'. After a series of non-constructive arguing with the male he He advised he would take the party up to the top level of the home.\\n\\nThe noise persisted. I had left mercy both a phone message and an email. I did not receive any correspondence.\\n\\nI called air B&B who advised that the occupants upstairs had the place booked for one more day. The noise level was too excessive and we could not stay there any longer. We were advised by the Air b&b accounted to find a hotel and the first nights stay would be compensated.\\n\\nAfter scrambling to find a hotel in dt Seattle during a PGA golf tournament, we have been displaced waiting to check into our room for noon.\\n\\nAir b&b agreed to refund the rental price for the plum apartment. However, they had advised that they \\'would have to look into\\' compensating us for the first nights stay into this hotel as the reimbursement nullified the initial agreement to cover the first nights stay.\\n\\nI really hope air b&b does the right thing here. This has been my first experience using this service and I can hounestly say I\\'m completely turned off by it. This experience has ruined what was supposed to me a memorable trip.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Really amazing apartment in a great neighborhood. Great location and walking distance to all the Ballard shops and restaurants. Mercy was very accommodating and sweet. Would definitely stay there again! The Plum Apartment was amazing for my wife and me.  It was as clean, spacious, and cool during the very hot days that we were visiting Seattle.  The access is very easy and the location is great, just a short walk to downtown Ballard and all of its restaurants, bars, and shops. Mercy and her family were not there during our stay, but she was very responsive to our questions via email. Plum was great. Modern and very comfortable. I would highly recommend it. Walking distance to many great restaurants and bars. We had a lovely stay at the Plum apartment! The space is even more beautiful than the photos. Everything was clean and the unit had all the amenities you could want! My boyfriend and I spent a few nights here after exploring the downtown area of Seattle. Ballard has a lot to offer by ways of food, shops, culture and water views and Mercy\\'s apartment was close to it all! Parking was super easy should you rent a car or drive one to the area. Most sounds can be heard from the house above the unit so this wouldn\\'t be the place to go if your goal is to sit in silence but luckily we are busy bees when we travel, as one should be in the beautiful PNW!!!! The Plum apartment was perfect! The pictures do not do this place justice. The apartment is located in a great neighbourhood with many great restaurants at a walking distance. The few things left for our first morning in the fridge were a nice attention. The bread was terrific!! The house was gorgeous and the backyard was great. I would definitely recommend this place.  Mercy was responsive in accepting our request and providing instructions on how to access the apartment.  This Ballard apartment is spacious and well-equipped; the accommodations are clean and comfortable.  The location is excellent with easy street parking.  A nice coffee shop (Java Bean), excellent French bakery (Cafe Besalu), and grocery store (QFC) are located right around the corner.  Numerous great restaurants are just a few blocks further. We walked to the Ballard locks (easy walk) and to Golden Gardens beach (longer hike).  Fixings for a simple breakfast left in the fridge to get us started were a nice touch.  We really enjoyed our stay and would love to return. Perfect spot in Ballard to relax but still have access to restaurants and shops.  Just as pictured.  Very cute and clean.  Thank you for accommodating a shorter stay and for such a relaxing time! One bedroom modern, gorgeous, clean, and well stocked apartment walking distance to all that Ballard has to offer. The host thought of everything one might ever need. She was responsive and flexible. This is a basement apartment with plenty of windows and light. The host actually put in some blackout curtains after I enquired about them, prior to our arrival. During our stay the house upstairs was also rented out and we could hear the people walking around. After contacting Mercy, she got in touch with the other guests and asked them to be mindful of us...which helped some. I\\'m sure that when the hosts are at home this is less of an issue as they are aware of their guests below. We really loved this space and had a positive experience overall. We hope to be back soon! Thanks for everything! :) We had a fantastic experience in this beautiful, light-filled apartment. I would absolutely stay here again! What a lovely, well-equipped place to call home for a few days! The comfortably modern apartment is right in the heart of Ballard, within walking distance of the neighborhood\\'s many shops, restaurants, and bars. Hosts are generous with their knowledge of the area and with the goodies found there—so nice to have fresh sourdough bread and coffee waiting for us. You couldn\\'t ask for more. What an amazing place. All our family loved it!!\\r\\nAmazingly well-equipped, very modern apartment and in a great location (right in the heart of Ballard, walking distance of almost everything)\\r\\nEasy parking for your car if you are driving, it has a beautiful patio that our kid enjoyed and the neighborhood was peaceful and noiseless\\r\\nA great place that we felt like home during our stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely come back again to Mercy\\'s house if I have the chance. Beautiful place, very homey, great location, easy in every way. We would definitely stay there again! The apartment was perfect!  Cozy but spacious enough to host my family of 5.  Everything was VERY clean and modern, and we absolutely loved staying here.  It also stayed very cool inside, which was nice given the hot weather.  This place is great, I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle.  I traveled to Seattle with a friend for a wedding and we were very pleased with our choice to stay here.  The apartment has a very updated and modern touch with plenty of space.  My friend even slept on the pull out couch and he said it was the most comfortable pull out couch he\\'s ever slept on.  Mercy is very accommodating and very responsive when I would email her with questions about the apartment.  She and her family made us feel welcome from the beginning and they even left us some local food to get us started on our first morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surrounding area of Ballard is a lot of fun, there are tons of great restaurants, bars, shops, and even a 24hr grocery store all within walking distance from this location.  When we felt like being \"tourists\" and going downtown to the space needle or visiting the University of Washington we were 4 miles (a short cab ride) from both.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can\\'t recommend staying in Ballard and at this location enough. What an incredible stay my husband and I had at the lovely Plum Apartment! We were in town for a wedding and most of the pre-wedding festivities took place in or near Ballard - we were right in the heart of it! Everyone kept remarking how perfectly located we were! The apartment itself is fantastic - wonderful light and layout, comfortable bed and pillows, awesome television set-up with Netflix, updated kitchen with everything we needed and a great washer and dryer! Having been on the road traveling for almost three weeks we felt at home in the Plum Apartment. Mercy was quick to respond, generous and kind. We can\\'t wait to come back to Seattle and stay there for a full week!!  Great location with tons of places to walk to!  The apartment looks just like the photos- very nice!    My son and I did some sightseeing in Seattle and stayed at the Plum Apartment during our visit. This was our first Airbnb experience and we may never stay in a hotel again! The accommodations were perfect. The apartment was well equipped with all the comforts of home and tastefully decorated. My son used the pull out sofa bed/couch and said it was very comfortable. My bad back enjoyed the memory foam mattress in the bedroom. The apartment was very clean, modern and met all of our expectations as advertised. The location couldn\\'t be beat. The house was on a quiet side street and within 1 block of public transportation and 2-6 block walk of a full service grocery store, coffee shops, superb bakeries, bars, excellent restaurants and night life. We had a rental car and found it a very short drive to all the sights in town and nearby burbs. Street parking close to the house was easy.You could easily do without a car and use mass transit and cabs from this location.\\r\\nMercy was \" incredibly\"  responsive and helpful with our reservations and during our stay. \\r\\nThe Plum Apartment is a terrific place to stay, in an excellent neighborhood   and located close to all the Seattle attractions and offered by a terrific host.\\r\\nI only hope my next Airbnb experience will be as nice as this one has been.\\r\\nMark Lovely two night stay @ Plum Apt! Perfect size for 3 of us (me, my husband and teen daughter). Quiet neighborhood yet close to shopping and other things we were doing in Ballard. \\r\\n Even though Mercy wasn\\'t around when we arrived at the Plum apartment, she provided great detailed information upfront (access code, fridge had basics already stacked). She also has a neighbor looking after the house and is available for questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment is great, clean and a wonderful location close to bakeries, groceries and the center of old Ballard.\\r\\n We had a lovely time at the Plum Apartment! The space was beautiful and very functional for us, three guests. Mercy left some staples and coffee in the fridge to get us started, which was a very nice touch. The apartment is in a great area, close to shops and restaurants. We will definitely be back! Emily was great to work with, very accommodating. The apartment was very clean and very comfortable bedding. Great experience! Apartment was neat and clean and had all the essentials. Definitely not fancy, but great location. The neighborhood is really fun and very walkable. Good french pastry place just about a block away. Pallavi was the sweetest host! She went out of her way to make me feel welcome. She constantly was in touch at my disposal to make my stay as pleasant as possible. The room was small, but it suited me perfectly. It was in absolute pristine condition and the neighborhood was exactly the same. Very quiet, nice, and it made me feel quitee at home. The neighborhood was nice. The room just as it looks, and the hosts were very nice (gave us the key at arrival, which was late in the night and then just let us be).\\r\\nThe location very useful for a tourist looking to go around to see Seattle with public transport not that far.\\r\\nThe room had all the things that could be needed, a TV, internet, fridge, microwave. I liked the overall experience. Pallavi and Sameer were excellent hosts.  They were very accommodating to my young family and even added an extra appliance to the suite when we expressed a need.  They also checked in with us via text multiple times to ensure a comfortable stay.  The suite is cozy and clean, with lots of light, nice fixtures and our own entrance.  We loved how close the room was to the heart of Ballard and enjoyed exploring this cute neighborhood. What a wonderful experience and place!  And the hosts are the nicest, kindest folks you will meet. \\nFrom the beginning of our correspondence, Pallavi was very responsive and kind. Everything went 100% smooth, from inquiry, check in, the stay, and check out. \\nVERY BEAUTIFUL SUITE!!! Perfect!  Located at ground level(not a basement!) of a brand new home. Private entrance, complete privacy, quiet, very safe neighborhood, awesome PRIVATE lanai right off of the suite!!! Such calm and serene energy flows in this space and property.   Pallavi and her husband are very kind and attentive, yet the space and experience is private. If I needed anything, they were a text away. The space is beautiful, cozy, perfect for a couple. \\nDowntown Ballard, which is two minute walk, is so fun!  Check out Cupcake Royale and the Golden Beetle. We also walked to the Ballard locks. My husband worked in dr SEATTLE during the week, so the location is perfect for that, ez commute to the heart of Seattle and all the attractions. You gotta check out Fremont and the Flying Apron gluten free bakery!\\nThank you for the wonderful stay!!!\\nWe are already booked for our next stay here later in July.  I had a marvelous stay at this lovely site. The room was as described, clean, comfortable, private, easy to access. Pallavi was incredibly welcoming, available, and flexible. My only sadness was that I eventually had to leave! Highly recommended. My boyfriend and I had experienced several delays with our flight so we couldn\\'t make it to our originally scheduled check-in time. Thankfully, Pallavi responded quickly to our update and made sure she would be home upon our newly scheduled arrival. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce we got there, we didn\\'t have any problem finding parking near the house (we rented a car via RelayRides). We were pleasantly surprised by a new and modern 2-story apartment building. Pallavi graciously greeted us and led us through a small garden path that wrapped around the outside of the building that took us to the private entrance to the guest room. Right outside of the guest room was a charming private back patio that Pallavi said we could use whenever we liked.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPallavi had thoughtfully furnished the room with everything we would need for a comfortable stay. The room itself was the perfect size for just the two of us. A plush, full-sized bed was neatly made, and the desk on the opposite side of the room had a small tray with an electric kettle, coffee, tea, and light snacks, as well as well as guides and brochures for exploring Seattle. The bathroom had modern fixtures and was SO clean (which is sometimes all you really want to see after a long trip!!). The shower even had a shower gel and shampoo dispenser attached to the wall. It was little details like this that assured us that we were in good hands. After Pallavi finished her quick tour she ensured us that we could contact her at any time in case we needed anything and left to let us settle in.\\r\\n\\r\\nPallavi had plenty of recommendations for exploring the neighborhood, and Ballard didn\\'t disappoint. Great cafes, boutiques, restaurants, and landmarks were only a 10-20 minute walk away (depending on how far you wanted to go) and we could easily spend an entire day there. Ballard Market (open 24 hours) was also only a few minutes walk and was a great last-minute stop for fresh produce snacks, and toiletries. \\r\\n\\r\\nPallavi and Samir themselves were thoughtful and kind hosts. They gave us plenty of privacy and we didn\\'t run into them during the day, but Pallavi did invite us to coffee with them if we wanted (we gladly accepted!). It was wonderful getting to know them--if you\\'re looking for good food (or a solid brew) and good conversation, I highly recommend it :). \\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, I loved staying here and would give my stay six stars if I could. Thanks so much Pallavi + Samir! Hopefully we\\'ll be back sooner than later :D! We really enjoyed our stay at this place. The suite has a private entrance and gated outdoor patio. It is in ideal Ballard location - walking distance to many restaurants, coffee shops, and the locks. Easy access to biking trails to downtown and Golden Gardens. Easy street parking. The hosts were very welcoming and incredibly nice. Would definitely recommend staying here! This little place is perfect for two people looking to stay in a trendy neighborhood in Seattle. The description was beyond accurate and the amenities were everything a high maintenance girl like me could ask for. The private entrance was perfect and our hosts were fabulous, welcoming, helpful, and sweet. Couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to stay in Seattle!!! We had a wonderful stay at Pallavi and Sameer\\'s and actually found out during our visit that we might be making another trip to Seattle soon and were disappointed to see what their place was already booked for that night! Pallavi went out of her way to accommodate our changing arrival time and all communication with her before and during our stay, in messages and in person, was clear and friendly. She also kindly stored our luggage on our departure day. The room was great, with a comfortable bed and luxurious bathroom, screened windows that opened to let in the cool air at night (Seattle broke a heat record on the day we were there, but the room was still perfectly comfortable), and easy street parking right outside the house. We like Ballard a lot, found the location to be perfect, and would definitely recommend Pallavi and Sameer as hosts and their suite as a great place for a comfortable Seattle stay. The room was very comfortable, quiet and impeccably clean. The hosts were considerate and polite and all communications were very smooth. We thoroughly recommend this as good value for money in a city that is generally expensive. The room was private and very clean.  The bed was comfortable and a modern shower.  The host were very quiet in the morning and nights so as to not disturb you. They were very friendly and willing accommodate whatever your needs were.  We absolutely loved our stay with Pallavi and Sameer. They are very thoughtful, kind, and respectful hosts, and we highly recommend their place to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room and bathroom were impeccably clean, and we were impressed by the modern finishes in the bathroom, as well as the availability of a fridge, microwave, TV, and fan for added comfort. They clearly have made an effort to create a space that is perfect for their guests. We also really appreciated the little touches, such as the snacks, toothbrush holder, and luggage rack. Although we were too busy exploring the Seattle area to enjoy the space, it was really nice that there was a private, outdoor seating area too.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir place is located in a quiet, safe neighborhood and is an easy stroll to the main, bustling streets of Ballard. We enjoyed the Ballard farmer\\'s market and the many restaurants on Market Street, as well as the convenience of their location to downtown Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also greatly valued our communication and interactions with them. They replied promptly to emails, offered ideas of things to do in the area, and checked in with us after our first night to see if there was anything they could do to make our stay better. It was extremely easy to coordinate picking up / dropping off the key. We felt that they respected our privacy but were available if we needed help.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had an excellent stay and definitely would stay here again! It was a lovely place in Ballard. We really enjoyed our stay. The location was perfect. We loved it. The host Pallavi was really nice and helpful. Ms. Sharma was professional, flexible and timely.  She was at the location for check in exactly when she stated and provided an expedient check in experience.  This room was very clean, streamlines and the bathroom was impressively spic and span.  If you are a technology ace, there is a big screen and a business desk.  Also, there is a closet to hang your finery and a private back patio.  The door could be left open where an amazing breeze was blowing through during my visit which was very refreshing.  I would stay here again if traveling in the Ballard area.   We were very satisfied with our hosts. Pallavi and Sameer were very accommodating throughout the booking process right up until we left. We went with our 16 month old baby and she checked with us several times to see if there was anything she could do to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We appreciated that they moved some room items to make more space, brought extra padding for her bed and helped us with our excessive luggage. I would say that the room size is perfect for a single person or a couple but was a bit tight for our family with an active little girl. That said, it was fine for a night and it depends what you are used to!\\n\\nThe room had a comfortable queen bed with silky bedding, a sparkling and tasteful bathroom and convenient extras like a fridge, microwave, and luggage stand. The outdoor space was nice to have. Everything felt clean and well-cared for.\\n\\nThe ease of checking in and out, coming and going and finding parking was perfect and the neighbourhood was simply the best. We loved finding a nearby yard sale, park, and countless places to eat delicious food.\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t been to this area, I would highly recommend staying in here in Ballard. It\\'s got a great vibe starting with the friendliest hosts. Was this a hotel? Felt like one but with more charm and personability. In the absolute best neighbourhood and easily walkable from great bars, restaurants and shops. The photos on Airbnb due not do justice to the space. It is very modern and in a great location. It feels very private and with a dedicated entrance feels very much like a hotel room (in a good way). I travel to Seattle for work and will be staying here repeatedly and will recommend to my work team. Pallavi\\'s communication was excellent and timely and she was very gracious and warm. I appreciated that she had some nice amenities- like coffee, shampoo and a hairdryer available. Pallavi was super communicative and welcoming right from the start. She communicated very promptly and was really flexible with how we could check in and check out. Once we arrived, she made sure we had everything we needed. The room was very quiet and private. Loved the exterior entrance and the private patio. We never heard a peep from the rest of the house while we were there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a lovely place to stay. If we need a place in Seattle again, we\\'ll definitely check to see if this room is available. We couldn\\'t have asked for a better experience staying with Pallavi. She worked with us as our arrival time was variable and we wanted to catch a sunset before grabbing the key to the room. The private entrance bedroom and bathroom were wonderful! Ballard (the neighborhood) is one of the nicest in Seattle. Parking was easy on the street, and the house is a very short walk to restaurants and shops. Pallavi also provided great recommendations for breakfast/brunch. We\\'d stay here again in a heartbeat!  Pallavi was great! Their place is really close to Market street, which is great, and the room is gorgeous and perfect. They were so sweet, too. It was our 5th wedding anniversary, and they had chocolate and wine waiting for us. Little touches around the room that were so thoughtful. Thank you guys so much! Pallavi and her husband are wonderful hosts! They even came to rescue us late at night when we were lost and brought us food on arrival. The room is private, clean and comfortable. Highly recommend!  Pallavi met us upon our arrival, told us where the unit was and send us emails to check that everything was right. The room was spotless and comfortable. Being in walking distance of our son was a major bonus. Perfect stay. Very convenient location, very short drive from city center. Moreover,  we had an awesome dinner in neighborhood, 5 mn walk. Bedroom was lovely, perfectly clean. Total privacy and freedom to come and go. Pallavi and Sameer were very welcoming and always willing to help. Highly recommended! Pallavi was an excellent host and we could not have asked for a better stay for our first Airbnb experience.  Weeks before we arrived Pallavi provided a lot of tips/suggestions for us to do while in Seattle and they were all wonderful and great recommendations to help make our visit a more pleasant experience.  The room was perfect and in great condition when we arrived.  We really liked the private entrance and the bed was super comfortable.  The location was awesome and had easy access to downtown Ballard and public transportation to get you anywhere in the city.  I would highly recommend staying with Pallavi and Sameer to anyone looking for a place in Seattle. Room as expected.  Hosts worked with our schedule for arrival.   I stayed for an enjoyable and comfortable 3 nights. It was quiet and as described by the Air BnB site.. \\r\\nThe welcome from the owner was very warm and she could not have been more helpful. She answered a number of queries about the neighbourhood. \\r\\nIt was useful to have a microwave and fridge.\\r\\nI hope to return to the States and Seattle and would hope to stay in this house again.\\r\\n My stay at Pallavi\\'s place was excellent.  It is new and clean.  Pallavi greeted me and showed me the space and was very kind, even pointing out that we were very close, within walking distance to the Ballard Market.\\n\\nI really liked that it has a private entry as I returned from a night out very late, and left early in the morning.\\n\\nI really enjoyed my stay and hope to return.\\n\\nThe neighborhood is a wonderful collection of well kept bungalows. I felt comfortable parking my car on the street. The host made us feel welcome.  The room was just as advertised and the location was perfect for exploring downtown Ballard.   \\r\\nPahlavi was kind and helpful  Pallavi was sweet and accommodating! I arrived late at night due to unforseen circumstances and she was still happy to greet me and accommodate me however she could. The place was clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again! Fantastic host! I couldn\\'t have asked for a better spot. The private entrance makes this experience so comfortable. Pallavi was very helpful the entire way through the the process. This spot is just up the street from the best spots in Ballard. Thank you so much! Pallavi and her hubby are wonderful. The room and home was immaculate. We put in a request to book their place and they were very kind at accepting our request last minute. Again the room was spectacular and the neighborhood is fantastic. Many great restaurants  and excellent nightlife. Would definitely recommend this wonderful place.  The neighborhood was very quiet.  The bedroom and bathroom were clean and comfortable.  Although I didn\\'t meet Pallavi, she gave me clear instructions for a self check-in.  It was nice that the bedroom included a microwave, tea kettle and small refrigerator.  There was lots of on-street parking and the neighborhood seemed very safe. Simple and easy. The space is extremely well maintained, private, and in a perfect part of town. Would happily stay again and hope too in the future :) Second time staying here. Super friendly, super easy, super convenient. Great place. I\\'ll be back again.  Pallavi went above and beyond the call of duty to help me in advance of a trip to Seattle with my husband. We went for my brother\\'s wedding and needed a steamer for my dress and my husband\\'s suit. When I asked if she had one, I was more than surprised to hear back from Pallavi that she purchased a steamer to have on hand when we got there. It is gestures like this that make staying in an AirBnb so much more meaningful than a hotel. My husband and I were comfortable, able to unwind in between wedding events and able to show up at the wedding wrinkle-free. Pallavi was also extremely flexible with our arrival plans - which were changing frequently ahead of the wedding. Thank you so much for a great stay in Ballard! Pallavi was an excellent host.  It was very easy to communicate and coordinate with her. They have a beautiful home which is in a great location. Our stay was absolutely lovely. Pallavi was kind and welcoming, excellent at communication, and gave us recommendations for landmarks and eateries in the locale. The room is quiet and very nice, with a private entrance and small patio outside, and upgraded fixtures inside. Easy access to bus lines made our travels around the city pleasant and simple. We will come here again, thank you! Pallavi was great! We communicated clearly via text, she greeted me with the key and I was free to come and go from the private entrance/room with my friend whenever. Clean place, very comfortable bed, beautiful modern bathroom, and complimentary teas and snacks provided! She even has a mini fridge, microwave, hot water boiler, paper cups, and an extra comforter if needed. All very convenient.\\n\\nOnly slightly negative thing is location - if you don\\'t mind the very suburban Ballard (a very nice neighborhood) and have a car, it\\'s perfect. My friend and I were trying to explore Seattle with public transportation so it was a bit out of the main action of Seattle. However, there\\'s a bus stop two blocks away walking and restaurants/bars in that area, with the bus taking you to downtown Seattle in 20 minutes or so. \\n\\nSo in reality, since the bus takes you to downtown Seattle in 20 minutes or so, it\\'s a great location but it FEELS far/removed. Depends on how you see it. \\n\\nBesides that, this airbnb was great and Pallavi was a wonderful host. Thank you so much again! Pallavi\\'s spare bedroom was ideal, private separate entrance, a bed, bathroom, desk and a couple chairs, fridge & microwave.  In Ballard you don\\'t need anything else.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunication and check in/out was easy, even though I kept very weird hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope to return. I would stay here again! Pallavi was extremely welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed. The room was just as the photos show. It was a lovely quiet spot.  The bed was quite comfortable.  It was a good experience! We had a wonderful stay in Pallavi\\'s place! We were unable to meet them in person, but Pallavi gave very detailed helpful instructions regarding self check in. The neighborhood is also very clean and safe, within walking distance to Ballard downtown. The amenities are exactly what you see in the pictures.  Pallavi was a great host and our room was just as described and also very clean and private. Pallavi was informative and enthusiastic about her neighbourhood.  We enjoyed our stay.   The location in proximity to shopping and restaurants was excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n The neighborhood is attractive and a place that I would be very comfortable living in.  Pallavi\\'s home is new and modern and very comfortable.  They have done a great job of providing everything one might need.  Will definitely stay here again. Me and my wife decided to extend our stay in Ballard at the last minute and needed a place to stay. Pallavi\\'s private room and bath was perfect. Clean, private, updated, easy access.........no negatives whatsoever. This will be at the top of our list next time we\\'re in town. Great location, new clean & private room. Didn\\'t get to meet our hosts, but they made it very easy for us to get into the room and they were very accommodating.  I would highly recommend a stay here for anyone looking for accommodations in the Ballard area Fantastic!  Jean was very responsive to requests and townhouse was perfect for our family vacation.  Having grown up in Seattle I can say that this is great Ballard location, walking distance to the locks and main area on Market - and easy access to downtown Seattle.  Great place - thanks Jean! This is the first time I use Airbnb, the experience was mixed. The house was ok but the clean policy and check out part was not friendly. We spent hours to wash dishes with hands, clean kitchen and looking for garbage ban, etc. But we were asked to pay extra fee $120 for we did\\'t do something they think we should do. Overall I was quite upset for my first Airbnb experience. Jean\\'s townhouse was perfect for our group of 4 adults, and centrally located for the all the weekend activities we had planned in Ballard. The kitchen and bathrooms were were stocked with all the necessities and everything was in great shape. Thanks Jean! Great Central Ballard location! SUPER CLEAN, well appointed with all that we needed.  The bedroom/bath layout for us was perfect with the twin beds in one room for our younger travelers and then the adults got the queen beds.   We loved the location! The property itself looked exactly as the photos and communication with Jean was great. Really looking forward to our next trip to Seattle :-)  Jean is a fabulous host and her home is perfect. My family and I absolutely loved the place and were very happy with our stay. We would absolutely rebook this property with Jean if we are ever in the Seattle area again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis home is fabulously located in Ballard with restaurants, shops, and the Ballard Locks within easy walking distance. We walked a lot and loved it. Downtown Seattle is about 10-15 minute drive and a relatively cheaper uber ride.\\r\\n\\r\\nJean is very good with communicating and answering questions. Her responses were always quick. The instructions for checking in and out were few, clear, and very simple to follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the home was very clean, well located, and working with Jean was great. We had no problems and very much enjoyed our stay in Ballard on this property! This was a perfect place to stay. The apartment was located close to downtown Ballard, near the locks, and not far from other great areas. The accommodations were roomy an very comfortable with everything we needed to have a good trip including a blender for our smoothies and premium stations on the T.V.\\r\\nIf we come back to the area we will definitely stay here again!\\r\\nCheryl Montelle, Brian Leatart and daughter Lily Leatart Fantastic stay.  This place was very clean and has everything you need.  Great location.  Walked 2 blocks to the fish ladders/locks.   Many great eating places within walking distance.  WiFi available, DirecTv had all the movie channels.  Highly recommended. Jean\\'s town house looks excatly the same as picture, it was very clean and in very good condition. Shops and restaruants are only a short walk and plenty of options. We had a wonderful time staying in Jean\\'s place. Wonderful spot in the perfect neighborhood.  Jean thought of everything, and it is completely fitted out for all kinds of groups.  We were a group of three couples and a toddler, and we had plenty of space.  The location was ideal, walking distance to everything, including the amazing Sunday farmers market! La descripción de la casa y la ubicación fue como estaba anunciada en la página. Jean fue siempre muy atenta y amable y resolvió todas nuestras dudas al instante. La casa estaba en perfectas codiciones muy limpia y organizada con todo lo necesario en baños y cocina.\\r\\n  En general muy buena experiencia  Jean\\'s townhouse is beautifully appointed,  well maintained,  and in a great location.  The garage was a much needed feature.  Our group each had their own car, so street parking for some was found a block or so away.\\n\\nCommunication from Jean was great!  All emails,  texts, and the manual inside the house were all clear and concise.  \\n\\nThis is my first time using Airbnb, and I would definitely recommend Jean. Jean\\'s townhouse was perfect for our family of three. It\\'s well appointed, tastefully decorated, and even toddler safe. And as a former Seattleite, I can attest that the location in Ballard is hard to beat. We appreciated being so close to the locks, restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores. Communicating with Jean was easy; she was very responsive. She even provided a helpful house manual that gave us all the information we needed about the rental and made it clear what was expected of us. I would recommend her place without reservation and we would happily stay there again. Booked this place for five family members to stay at when they came to Seattle and they loved it!  The townhouse was stocked fully stocked with anything you could need - extra towels, blankets, hair dryer, toiletries, first aid kit, and plenty of kitchen supplies.   There was also plenty of hot water for each of them to take a shower in the morning. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is perfect for walking around Ballard, and the garage in the townhouse worked out well for parking the rental car at night.  Everyone said that they would definitely stay here again.   Everything was wonderful, and location was convenient! The host was quick to reply and very gracious. Thank you so much for opening your home to us! This house was very clean and a perfect size for a larger group. Great location to see The Locks and there were many great restaurants in the area.  It\\'s really amazing home. I like it, and every time when I\\'ll come to Seattle I\\'ll take it:) The host was wonderful and flexible. The house was nice and clean. I was very happy. It is within easy walking distance of many cool places in Ballard. I would stay here again. Great location. Kid friendly and she had everything we needed. She was very responsive and we were even able to get in early.  The townhouse was lovely, fully equipped and a welcoming place to return to after a day of intense sailing. Jean was highly responsive throughout the booking process. Jean\\'s place is conveniently located in Ballard. The apartment was clean and true to the pictures. Jean was readily available and responded promptly to questions. I would definitely stay again! Jean was extremely helpful.  We checked in to a clean and comfortable home. The fireplace was excellent and the garage perfect/secure for our project equipment storage (we were testing offshore Shilshole).  We\\'ll stay again if the place isn\\'t already booked. This property worked out perfectly for me and my family for our Christmas holiday. There were a total of five of us who stayed here (the property can sleep six), and there was plenty of room - bathrooms, kitchen and cooking space, laundry, even a fireplace for maximum coziness! The property was within walking distance of Ballard and having a garage was handy, too. Bus lines into downtown Seattle are easy and within walking distance as well, so you can avoid traffic and parking hassles at many of the most popular tourist attractions. We\\'ve stayed at other Airbnb properties and hotels in Ballard and this was by far the best.\\n\\nBut perhaps most importantly was our hostess! We had an issue upon walking in where the heat didn\\'t work in a couple of the rooms, and the hostess was incredibly communicative throughout the entire process. Even though she was out of town she was in constant contact and also sent maintenance to correct the problem immediately, and this over the Christmas holiday! Our holiday vacation went uninterrupted and all was well. I don\\'t have a bad word to say about our experience. Newly renovated building. It has its own kitchen, bathroom and s mall patio as well. When I stayed, there was no one in the building so I had quiet, cozy time. Having a designated parking is also a big plus!    Mario was a great and attentive host. The studio was just lovely. We spent 9 nights at the property and it certainly felt like home away from home. The studio was immaculate, clean, private, quiet, conveniently located, spacious, tastefully decorated and with all of the amenities we needed. I especially appreciated french door access to outdoor patio and the great water pressure and temperature in the shower.\\r\\nI would definitely recommend the studio and Mario to anyone looking for a place to stay in Ballard area.\\r\\n\\r\\n Mario\\'s home was lovely, very private, incredibly clean and just perfect for my stay. The neighborhood was very quiet and so close to the shops/restaurants/docks in Ballard. The apartment had everything I needed and I hope to stay here numerous times. Mario is a wonderful host. His apartment was excellent for the need I had. I rented for a senior aunt and my cousin. My aunt was sight challenged and has walking challenges. Mario installed extra lights that were bright and motion sensord that helped with the one large unlit step that needed a light and the stairs to the front door that really gave a sense of security. Once inside this lovely apartment everything was easily accessible. The bath was wonderful, shower large and alot of hot water. The kitchen had everything one needed to cook, microwave, and a large refrigerator. Cabinets were finished nicely, the bamboo floors were lovely throughout the apartment, and quite a contemporary feel everywhere. The French doors leading out to the private garden with a fountain and a table for two, just the right touch of romance for this lovely private garden tucked away in Ballard. When I checked in the needs for extra blankets, covers, sheets, etc, all were still in their new packages, hidden in the couch that opened into an extra bed. There was another cot for an extra person, making room for four easily. The large king size bed was a dream. The size, the sheets, pillows, and comforter made this place a desirable place comparable to the hotels in Ballard that are upscale. Any questions,or needs were quickly answered by Mario. The fact that he went out and installed extra lights for my senior aunt\\'s special needs says enormous things of the type of desirable person affiliated with Airbnb. I heartily recommend  Mario, and his apartment to all who will use this service. I will use this service again, and am glad to know of the quality that Mario offers all who will use him.\\r\\nCurt , Juanita, and Greg Mario\\'s place was ideal for our stay near our family.  It was very clean and had everything we needed.  Great king size bed and was\\r\\nAll very comfortable.  We especially liked having our own entrance.\\r\\nMario was easy to work with and answered any question I had. \\r\\nBeautifully decorated place.  We will be staying there again. Although just a single room, the apartment was large, spotless and very comfortable. The kitchen was great. However, the bed was the best part ... so comfortable that I had a hard time getting the motivation to get out of bed in the morning. Our stay at Mario\\'s place was a great way to end our honeymoon. We found the place at the last minute and Mario was very accommodating, turning around the booking quickly, leaving us details so we could check in late at night and allowing us to stay a little longer on check out so we didn\\'t have to traipse around Seattle with our luggage. The place itself is great, amazingly comfy bed, NetFlix, self contained kitchen was great for a late night snack, located in the cute suburb of Ballard, with cafes and restaurants a 5 min walk away. Thanks again Mario! This was a great place in an awesome location in Ballard! Nice neighborhood and really thriving little downtown area with excellent bars and restaurants (all walking distance). Not too far from downtown Seattle as well. Mario was very kind and made sure we had everything we needed. The bed was AMAZING!!! High recommend this place and would definitely stay here again. Mario`s apartment was new and clean and very light for a lower unit. It was comfortable, felt homey, and has a nice little kitchen and office nook. The king bed is outrageously comfy and the flat screen with netflix makes it hard to leave.\\r\\nMario is very friendly and responsive to all calls and texts. He made sure we were all settled in before he left, had a handy key retrieval if he wasn`t to be around, and even brought us a vase from his home when we showed up with flowers. \\r\\n It looks like the back patio would be nice to use when it is warm. The unit is a half a block away from a nice neighborhood pub, within short walking distance to a great bakery, a good QFC grocery store, and Skillet restaurant for breakfast, etc. The whole Ballard area has good pubs, restaurants, and shops along NW Market St, Ballard Ave, and surrounding, with Walrus and Carpenter, Ocho, Bastille, Staple and Fancy, The Noble Fir, Hazelwood and Bitterroot all walkable. \\r\\nWe only wished we had had more time here and will definitely return to Mario`s apartment. We greatly enjoyed our stay.  The studio was cozy, clean and spacious.  Mario was courteous and accommodating.  The next time we visit our kids in Seattle, I would definitely stay here again! Mario\\'s place was awesome. Great location and a nice quiet and comfortable place. It was within walking distance of the great downtown Ballard area. We enjoyed the Matador for a drink and the Hi-life for some delicious food. Hot cakes was pretty high on the list to visit but it was packed every time we walked by. Guess we will have to go back and we would try to stay at Mario\\'s place again. We loved Mario\\'s apartment located within walking distance of Ballard\\'s wonderful local shops, theater and bookstore.   I will tell my friends in Spokane who also visit relatives living in small apartments in Seattle!\\r\\n \\r\\nAll furniture and supplies look brand new, stylish and pleasant.  Mario was very accommodating with our travel schedule, lighting and arrangements for arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\n Mario is an excellent host - he\\'s very responsive and made the entire process super easy.  The apartment is as pictured ... essentially new, very clean, very quite, cozy, and comfortable.  The neighborhood is also quiet yet close (walking distance) to Ballard and all it has to offer.  Easy access to the city bus a short 1/2 block away.  When in Seattle Mario\\'s place will be my first choice!   A beautiful, comfortable studio! Brand new renovation. Quiet, nice layout. Very comfy bed. Easy walking to Ballard restaurants and movie theater! Mario is a thoughtful and friendly host who I met only by chance the first day as he was updating the door lock. Mario built in sensors that light up the private entry path- a really nice touch when returning at night. I stated a week and found it to be pleasant, very comfortable, and convenient. A wall mounted electric fireplace added a nice amount of heat during some chilly nights, and looked beautiful too. I would stay here again and look forward to it! Thank you Mario. My stay at Mario\\'s place was perfect.  The apartment was even more cozy and comfortable than I had even anticipated; and I thoroughly enjoyed the fire place, and the magnificent bed. I was there for work so the little office nook also came in handy. Mario was out of the country while I was there so we never met, but we managed to communicate everything necessary to enable the check in to run smoothly.  I come to Seattle often for work and I would most definitely stay there again. This was a wonderful place to stay, 8 minute walk to downtown Ballard (passing several cafe\\'s along the way for my morning coffee) spotless, seamless check in - out, and the most comfortable bed I\\'ve slept in for a long while.\\r\\n\\r\\nMario\\'s place comes with a 100% recommendation from me.\\r\\n Mario is a very attentive host who is always available by phone for any questions.   His place is modern, clean and comfortable.  We\\'ll definitely try to stay here on our future trips to Ballard.  Wonderful stay!  Cozy, clean, modern, quiet and nicely furnished spacious, efficiency apartment.  My wife loved the property.  Hope to stay there again when visiting the area!!  Mario and his place are wonderful.  Extremely comfortable, immaculately clean, and fully equipped.  Will be back soon.  Cindy Dobbs This a great place, clean, cozy and central. Mario was great! The place was very cozy and comfortable.  The bed was particularly comfortable. This was my second timing staying at Mario\\'s place. (See my first rave review written previously). It was my second stay of many, as I come to Seattle often and this perfect little apartment makes my work trips so much more enjoyable! My new favorite part of the stay is waking up early for morning runs along the water not too far away. Followed by a caffeine stop at one of the local coffee shops up the street. I\\'m starting to feel like a local, all thanks to this lovely place. See you again soon Ballard!  Loved Mario\\'s place! It was my first time using airbnb and was a little apprehensive at first but Mario made everything so simple. We arrived, typed in the door code and walked into our beautiful home for the weekend. I couldn\\'t have asked for an easier first airbnb experience! The apartment was in a wonderful location-close to tons of great restaurants. The space was clean and comfortable. The bed was FANTASTIC! Soo comfortable. There was a parking space for us which was a huge plus. Overall I would highly recommend it and definitely would stay again.  The apartment was perfect for us!  The location is so amazing that we didn\\'t rent a car for four days.  There is a supermarket and fabulous restaurants nearby.  Bakeries, pubs, and shops are super close.  We went to a Mariners game using the bus which is around the corner.  The apartment was clean and well-done with a nook and a separate light for working.  The bikes were an added bonus.  Mario is wonderful and accessible.  A super host.  We will return! The listing was exactly how I expected--clean, cozy and comfortable.  The bed was my favorite part.  I hadn\\'t slept that well in years....YEARS!\\r\\n\\r\\nMario was an excellent host.  He was available to answer any questions I had about arrival and entry and is easily reachable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood was fine.  It was close to where we needed to be and had easy access to a few restaurants and coffee shops.  It\\'s about a 5 minute taxi ride to the shore and only cost $5-8 per trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place comes with a double door walk-out to a beautiful patio with table and chairs, which we used every night to catch up and philosophize with friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kitchen was well equipped.  We had everything we needed to pan fry steaks, make rice, and saute veggies.\\r\\n\\r\\nI honestly felt right at home, had everything I needed right there and slept like a king on a king. Mario came and introduced himself the first evening. His apartment had everything we needed and a very inviting yard. The neighborhood is close to shopping and lots of restaurants. Also, it was very easy to access the apartment with the secure codes.  Great stat in Seattle. The apartment was clean and well fitted out. The bed was huge and very comfortable. Loved the little garden area where we sat out for breakfast. Particularly enjoyed the daily visit from a squirrel plus a visit on the last day by a lovely tabby cat! Mario was very helpful to my queries and responded very promptly. Once we figured out the bus route it was reasonably easy to get to down town as we didn\\'t have transport. Would definitely recommend this to others.  The apartment was perfect in every way -- exactly as described with a luxurious king size bed and matress, full size refrigerator., great towels, etc. There was even a first aid kit!! And, in a district with little public parking, we were happy to have our own free parking space with the unit. This was our first airbnb experience and we will definitely do it again. Mario is a fantastic host.  The experience is better than the listing page.  We will definitely stay there again. Great apartment in a great location.  Was perfect for us, and bikes were an addde bonus to go exploring (really appreciated Mario going out of his way to get the bikes working).  Outdoor area was also really handy, as well as the laundry/gym.  Would definitely recommend.   The listing was accurate - the apartment was nicely stocked with the necessary items and had everything we needed. However, we had trouble getting in touch with Mario (via email and several calls and voice mails) about checking in and when the code to the gym and laundry didn\\'t work and we didn\\'t hear back from him until the night before we left. He was traveling and out of the country, which I understand - just wish he would have reached out prior to our check in date to let us know that he would be gone and that he would have given us the correct code. The location is great - walkable to Ballard and safe.  Mario was an excellent host to my Wife and I. From the very beginning  he was nothing but accommodating to our stay. Can\\'t say enough good about his Ballard home.  Loved this unit. Everything was new and clean. Mario was very responsive. Location was great. Will stay again. My husband and I came for the first time visiting Seattle and what a Wonderful Experience we had! What made it even more great was Mario and Monica\\'s sweet abode. We were very impressed with the little apt. It was super clean and very welcoming! My favorite was the electronic fireplace wall unit. Everything we needed was provided! Wonderful and gracious hosts! We wished we could have shared more time with Mario and Monica.  This place is located in a very good area which is close to everything! The Mexican restaurant La Carta De Oaxaca which Mario recommended was Delicious! (He was right) we would love to come again! And hope to do so!  We very highly recommend this place!   Muchisima Gracias Mario y Monica. Mario\\'s place was very well appointed and immaculate. The private yard and central location in Ballard were especially nice. This is a great place to stay if you\\'re going to be out and about in Ballard/Fremont and looking for a \"home base\". The bikes, while we didn\\'t get a chance to use them, were an especially nice touch. Mario even took time to come and check on the bikes as we unexpectedly decided to use them. Overall, this was a great experience. We loved our first airbnb experience. We stayed in Mario\\'s 3rd floor, 2 bedroom apt. It was very spacious, so cozy, comfortable and very clean.We even enjoyed the deck off the bedroom one sunny afternoon. Mario provided all the information we needed to make our stay very easy and enjoyable. All communication was done through emails with quick responses. We loved the neighborhood, easy walk to downtown Ballard, and only a few blocks from our son\\'s apt. \\r\\nWe will be back often visiting our son, and we will also encourage all our family and friends to stay in one of Mario\\'s apts. during their visits. The studio was just as described-cozy, clean, quiet and excellent neighborhood. Perfect home base for exploring the city, would definitely stay again. We had a great time staying at Mario\\'s cozy studio in Ballard. The studio had everything we needed. It was nice to have a small kitchen so that we could cook up what we snagged at the Ballard Sunday Farmer\\'s Market. The location is great--so convenient to Market Street. Lots of room for the two of us and we took great advantage of the outside patio area. The inside is nicely furnished--exactly as it looks in the pictures--and the bed is very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again.  Love this place. I am a repeat stayer, and will continue to come back time and time again This is a great place to stay. The apartment is private and nice. The location is walking distance to Ballard and 2 minutes from bus #40 to most anywhere in Seattle. Also convenient to bike paths. My son and I really enjoyed our stay. Thanks Mario! This cozy apartment was just as described! It was clean and modern, cozy and quiet and right in the heart of a wonderful area of Seattle. All details were perfect. The linens were soft and warm, the bed very comfortable and the kitchen well appointed. We could not be happier with the space. There was a great outdoor patio area just out our back door which we would have enjoyed more except it was raining quite a bit. And having an available washer and dryer (very new btw) was great. Also, loved the keyless entry!\\r\\nIf there was a 5+ rating this would be it. I can\\'t wait to return!\\r\\nSuper easy communication and prompt responses! We arrived sooner than expected and Mario let us check in early which really helped us out.\\r\\nThank you so much Mario The location was wonderful and the size of the place was just right for the two of us.  The host is very responsive with any requests.   Mario\\'s studio exceeded our expectations. Not only was it located in a great part of town, but the studio itself was well appointed with a comfy bed and comfortable living area/kitchen. We loved the keyless entry and Mario even gave us a call to make sure we knew how to get in properly. When visiting Seattle in the future, we\\'d certainly stay here again. Thanks Mario!  Mario\\'s studio is super clean and well appointed. It was perfect for my needs and the King bed was divine. Mario was easy to communicate with and pleasant all around. Easily the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on! Seriously, I looked at the tag on the mattress so I could remember when I buy a new bed. The rest of the apartment was great, very clean and nicely decorated. The neighborhood is great, tons of restaurants and bars a short walk away. Highly recommended! We had a great time visiting Ballard while staying at J. Lynn\\'s place.  The condo was everything promised.  She provided us with a nice welcome letter that included several great suggestions for places to check out and restaurants to eat at, it was very helpful.  The neighborhood is great and the location is very convenient.  We were able to navigate Ballard and downtown without a car as public transit and the heart of Ballard were both within a few blocks.  The condo provided everything we needed, a comfortable bed, nice bathroom and a balcony.  This is a perfect place for people that want a great base for their Seattle adventure. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Conveniently located relative to immediate services, e.g. groceries; deli; restaurants; pubs; health club.\\r\\nAccurately described by host. The transaction and process of using the home was painless with timely responses and good information. This place made us fall even deeper in love with Seattle. Walking distance to tons of restaurants and shops. The apartment itself was very clean and we felt quite comfortable there. The loft gave it a very open feel. J.Lynn was very communicative and easy to work with. We highly recommend this space! My husband and I absolutely enjoyed our stay at this beautiful, clean and cozy place. Great location - quiet and safe neighborhood just a couple blocks away from many great restaurants and shops. J.Lynn is easy and pleasant to communicate with - she left us clear instructions and recommendations about her apartment and the neighborhood and responded promptly to any questions we had. We highly recommend this place. \\n\\n\\n We had a great stay at J. Lynn\\'s place. It\\'s in a great location in Ballard: walking distance to restaurants, cafes, sights to see and things to do. Despite this, the area is very quiet. Apartment is equipped with everything we needed (and then some) and excellently furnished, including a bed another reviewer correctly pointed out as a highlight. This spot was terrific! It was beautiful, well-equiped, and comfortable. The host emailed us just after we arrived to check on us. That was so reassuring in case anything went wrong.  The best coffee was three blocks away, and there were numerous restaurants to explore. Thanks so much for the perfect place from which to enjoy Seattle! The apartment has a dining/living room downstairs and a sleeping quarter on the loft.  It is clean and quite roomy for two.  It also has a parking space and wifi. The location is super convenient.  There are lots of restaurants within a short walk, and every Sunday there is a farmer\\'s market at Market square.  We never met the host in person.  All communications were through emails or e-messages.  she is courteous and accommodating.  All in all we enjoyed our stay and had a very positive experience. This was a very comfortable, clean, attractive, quiet apartment very near all the charming stores and restaurants of Ballard.  Although the host was not on hand upon my arrival, she advised me in advance about the easy pincode lock that gave access to the apartment along with a detailed description of the exterior which made it easy to spot at night when I arrived, and she checked in with me by text the next morning to make sure that all was as it should be and urged me to get in touch with her if any problem arose.  She also left an informative note with an excellent map and tips for the local area.   JLynn\\'s condo was beautiful and in a perfect location. She was very conscientious about getting us info for check in and check out and responsive to any questions. Great host, would absolutely return next time we\\'re in Seattle. We really enjoyed our stay at J. Lynn\\'s condo. Located on a quiet street w our own parking spot, it was big, well decorated, and very clean.  The king sized bed was wonderful!  And it really was walking distance to the coolest resaurants, bars and shops in Ballard, one of the prettiest places we have ever stayed.  Pictures don\\'t do this place justice!  Very tidy, well appointed, comfy large bed, ultra quiet street (a bicycle-way, so cars avoid it) and just 4 blocks away on foot from all that wonderful Ballard trendiness. I stayed here for a month and don\\'t think I could have found a better place in Ballard. You can walk to practically everything awesome in 10 minutes or less - including grocery stores, restaurants, farmer market, and all the cool little boutique ballard shops -  and the neighborhood is still super quiet and safe. The apartment itself is equally as fantastic, with excellent decor, high ceilings, furnishings and appliances, and - as other reviewers have echoed - quiet possibly the most comfortable bed in the world (no joke). J lynn is a kind and caring person and fantastic host who is attentive to anything you may bring up, and always had little goodies for the place when I\\'d bump into her. I would HIGHLY recommend this place for short or long term stay We had a wonderful stay with JLynn. Her condo is perfectly located, an easy walk from all of Ballard\\'s hot spots and amenities. It\\'s both very comfortable (with an excellent bed and shower) and tastefully decorated. JLynn was next door in case we needed anything, but we had the place to ourselves and total privacy. Thanks! We just returned from a week long family (adults only) vacation in Seattle.  Our trip goal was to spend time with our son who lives in Ballard and our daughter and her \\'sig. other\\' who are from CT.  We were able to find the perfect \\'home port\\' for four adults in this lovely old house just a few blocks away from our sons place and all of the local Ballard activity.    Once inside this home we knew we had made the right choice.  It is top notch.  Very well maintained with top of the line finishes and all of the amenities and right in the thick of things.  Comfy, comfy, comfy beds.  Also, this house was a very quiet space.  Perfect.  Bob was very helpful and always available if we had questions.  We were able to see so much of Seattle and the islands (of course we had our own tour guide) and then return to a super comfortable but elegant space to rest up for the next adventure.   Seattle is an amazing place and there is so much to see.  We did the touristy things first to learn and then local spots for fun.  Climbed the mountain, rode the ferries and visited many museums and galleries.  Even rode a duck for a great history tour with Capt. Baveliver.   Ballard has so much to offer and we found it has the best restaurants in the city.  Our last visit was 8 years ago and so much has changed. We really could have stayed another week to see more.  So of course we have already started talking about another trip with the grandchildren.  Can\\'t wait.   I had a wonderful stay in Bob\\'s apartment! It\\'s a beautifully remodeled space and it had everything I needed. Bob was very communicative and left detailed information about the apartment. Highly recommended. We loved this place. It was very clean, comfortable and nicely furnished. The living room was sunny and pleasant. It was perfect for our family of four adults and one child.  The place is located on a very pleasant street waling distance to the main shopping area of Ballard.  Bob the host was very accommodating and responsive.  We really enjoyed our time at Bob\\'s yellow house!  Our upstairs apartment was so beautiful, spacious, and comfy.  The whole place was impeccably maintained and furnished beautifully.  The renovation was smartly planned out too.  I wished we could live there!  Bob gave us a tour of the downstairs apartment too!  The downstairs was gorgeous with vaulted ceilings and a chef\\'s kitchen.  This is an easy place to call home!  And Bob was such a great communicator and warm host.  We\\'ll try to visit again!   Our stay at Bob\\'s renovated two bedroom in Ballard couldn\\'t have been better. The rooms were tastefully furnished, the bathroom and kitchens were modern and complete, and the rooms were stocked with everything you could possibly need for an extended stay. The skylights and windows flooded the whole place with natural light even during rainy days. Best of all, the house was an easy walk from Ballard\\'s great restaurants and farmer\\'s market. We will definitely find an excuse to stay there again soon. Our family of 5 had a great time in Seattle. The apartment is spacious, clean and very well equipped. Location is great, with public transport, shops and restaurants all close by.\\r\\n\\r\\nHosts Bob and Mary were great hosts. Always on hand to help. Thank you both very much for a wonderful stay.\\r\\n Bob\\'s apartment is amazing.  It\\'s right in the Ballard area of Seattle and just blocks from coffee shops, restaurants, and the Sunday Farmers Market!  The home itself is very new and clean with all the amenities you could need for stay.   The kitchen is awesome (especially if you like to cook)!  Looking forward to returning to Seattle and staying here again.    Bob\\'s place was great, very clean and bright (for Seattle at least :)). The Ballard neighborhood was awesome - tons of options to walk to for a cocktail, coffee or a bite to eat. It was also really easy to get downtown on the bus line, which I would recommend for easy and cheap transportation. The house was very comfortable and clean, and beautifully finished. The location was great - very easy to walk to groceries, coffee, restaurants - a highlight of our week in Seattle was waking to see salmon at the salmon ladder. We loved our stay here. This home was so clean, well maintained and beautifully renovated....exactly how its portrayed on airbnb....very welcoming and comfortable!! Our Host Bob was great!! Bob met us at the house when we arrived and gave us a run through on how things worked and answered all of our questions...Bob is always just a phone call away if you need anything.  The location in Ballard is perfect....a beautiful quiet neighborhood and walking distance to everything!!! There is no off street parking but no problem...we never had a problem finding a parking space in front of the house or just a couple of houses down (Bob did let us know about the parking before we arrived but like I said it was not a problem)!! Next trip to Seattle, we would love to stay here again!!! Our host was in continual contact as we needed information, leading up to our arrival. The place looked great in the internet and was even better than what we expected. The neighborhood, which we already knew, was great. We absolutely LOVED our stay in this beautiful home. The high quality kitchen, comfy beds, and ample living space made for a perfect home away from home for our family of 5. Very clean and comfortable. Bob was kind to check in about our needs for our new baby and offered a pack n play and crib in advance of our stay. The location was perfect for us and allowed for a walkable experience with our kids (coffee shop 2 blocks away, restaurants close by). Found street parking within a 1/2 block easily each day. The only thing that was a little tricky for our family was the number of stairs for lugging all of our suitcases and gear for the kids, and our big BOB stroller- stairs to the front door followed by a steep set of stairs to access the house, and another set of stairs to get to the bedrooms. We arrived later than we wanted to due to a less than happy baby, and hoped that we didn\\'t wake our hosts with our many trips up and down the stairs to get everything in. That said, we would LOVE to stay here whenever we visit Seattle and would happily negotiate those stairs for such a sweet spot. The elevation is what provides the view and the sunny perch with peak a boo views of the space needle and surrounding areas. Gorgeous. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would! Fantastic spot.  Awesome house and wonderful host! Would definitely stay there again! I had the great opportunity to be Barbara and Tau\\'s second guest in their new garden level suite. I fell in love with it immediately - they really put a lot of thought and effort into making the space comfortable and welcoming for their guests, and provide such sweet little touches such as coffee, homemade cookies (yum), a little notebook with all the local information you would need to find your way around. I loved the space - open layout with a lot of great light. Very clean and very lovely. I don\\'t want to rave too much about it otherwise it will be fully booked for the next time I want to go back ;).  Highly recommended. You will be very happy here! Our first experience with Airbnb was fabulous.  Barb had made us cookies and left other goodies upon our arrival.  It was such a nice treat after having traveled all day.  The garden apartment was even better than the pictures made it out to be.  It was newly finished and just had such a comfortable feeling we almost didn\\'t even want to explore Seattle.  The location is perfect to walk to almost anything and everything fun.  Great eateries, shopping and farmers market all nearby.  We will be coming back to the area often and just hope that we can stay here again, it was that good. Barbara and Tau were wonderful hosts - easy to communicate with and available.  The place was wonderfully appointed, fantastic layout, and in a great neighborhood. I can only echo previous reviews. Our stay at the Ballad Garden Apartment was simply wonderful and it\\'s true that it\\'s even much nicer than the photographs suggests. Everything is brand spanking new and we were surrounded by good taste and good quality. This homey home away from home is in a quiet neighborhood with the occasional distant sound of children laughing and playing at recess, which we loved. The best bakery in town is just steps away (but plan on getting there early if you want to get in) and downtown Ballard is an easy walk. Perhaps most importantly, our hosts, Barb and Taru, couldn\\'t have been nicer, more generous or more accommodating. One reviewer mentioned the homemade cookies, but failed to mention the oranges, granola bars bottled water and even enough coffee and cream to get us started. It was all over the top in the nicest of ways. If you\\'re planning a stay in Ballard, you definitely want to stay here. The Ballard garden apartment was perfect for our week long stay in Seattle. Barbara and Taru were excellent hosts. The apartment was  clean, airy and full of light. The bed was very comfortable. We loved the location as it is on a quiet residential street but close to great restaurants, bars, bakeries, the Sunday farmer\\'s market and a grocery store. On street parking was available either directly in front of the apartment or within a very short walk. I highly recommend this apartment for a great stay in Seattle. The Ballard Garden Apartment was lovely. It was well appointed and had all the comforts of home. Barbara left us snacks and was very welcoming. The locations is very convenient to downtown Ballard as well as restaurants and coffee shops. We will stay again! We had the best time staying in the Ballard Garden Apartment. We felt as if we were staying with family. The apartment is beautiful and so much more than we expected, everything is brand new. It was perfect for myself, my husband and our 9 month old daughter. Barbara left us some wonderful treats that was a nice suprise, we had coffee and snacks when we woke up without having to run to the store. The location is wonderful and walking distance to everything you\\'ll need. Ballard is our favorite part of Seattle :) We hope you enjoy it as much as we did. We\\'ll be back!!!  We can\\'t say enough positive things about Barbara\\'s AirBNB apartment. \\r\\n\\r\\nEverything is really brand new, and very clean.  The layout is great, with a bedroom you can close the door to, in case one person wants to watch TV in the living room, or someone wants a nap.  The kitchen is perfectly setup for cooking, with everything you would need.  We did go to the farmer\\'s market and had some \\r\\nfun cooking local foods...Morel Mushrooms.  It\\'s good to have an alternative to all the great restaurants, it makes the trip more interesting and affordable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is great, only a half a block to the bus stop, which will take you almost everywhere.  We never rented a car, and had a great time walking and bussing.  We were in walking distance of the Chittenden locks and the Nordic museum, both great.  We enjoyed the Natural History Museum at Washington University and MOHAI.\\r\\nDon\\'t miss eating at Ray\\'s Boathouse and Volterra, and for desert the Pie Bar and Walt\\'s Scoop, all within walking distance. Super easy to book and quick response. Barbara was a great host.  We loved both the place and the location. Photos do not do this place justice. Roomy, tons of light. Great little kitchen. Short walk to tons of great restaurants and shops. Highly recommended walking along Ballard Ave & stopping by Golden Gardens park for sunset.   Barbara was great. She welcomed us then left us to settle and be comfortable.  The location was fabulous.  So close to downtown and everything we needed.  Around the corner from our daughter which was perfect.  The unit was lovely, clean, new construction, comfortable, and Barbara was easy as a contact..  The property lacked for nothing. Thanks!  We hope to be back! This is a fabulous apartment with wonderful hosts! Comfortable and well appointed. Barbara has thought of every basic need from olive oil to shampoo and a hair dryer. Easy access to public transportation and a short walk into Ballard. I had a great time and will stay again the next time I visit Seattle. Great spot in Ballard close to 24th and Market st shops/restaurants.   Brand new well designed apartment in owner\\'s home.  Plenty of privacy and responsive friendly host.   Spacious with comfy bed and plenty of kitchen space.   Dining etc. Is Designed for a couple plus perhaps a small child or two; not for entertaining.  A great week.  Thanks, Barbara! We thoroughly enjoyed our first airbnb experience. Barbara was so welcoming and obviously put a lot of attention and love into the apt. Which made it feel warm and cozy. It had everything we needed and more...fully stocked kitchen, bathroom supplies (hairdryer too). Ballard and its lovation were outstanding with restautants and desert places like Hot Cakes\". Bus 40 tan right to downtown. We would love to come back and stay. Barbara made us feel welcome and at home from the first minute. The welcome cookies are every bit as good as we\\'d been led to believe, the apartment had everything we needed, and the location itself is perfect: surrounded by a ton of good food, drink, and transportation downtown. Couldn\\'t ask for a better experience. Barbara is a thoughtful and gracious host.  The apartment is an architectural jewel, designed, built, decorated and equipped perfectly whether you stay for a weekend or far longer. \\r\\nThe unit is bright and incredibly comfortable with a high-end equipped kitchen and a great bathroom.  Barbara even provides cozy robes!  The bedroom is great with a very comfortable bed, a variety of duvet and lighter blankets and loads of space (closet and dresser) to unpack.  Gorgeously finished concrete black floors have radiant heat.\\r\\nThe whole place is spacious and so calming.  The wall color and furnishings gave us a very Zen/peaceful feeling.  Entrance is private.  Windows are double paned and we did not hear any noise (it seems there is construction on every block in Ballard.  We also did not hear any footsteps or sound from our hosts who live above.\\r\\nThe location can\\'t be beat.  Walking distance from Market Street with  the best restaurants and shops.  QFC (upscale supermarket), is a quick walk.  Will definitely stay again and again. Barbara was a wonderful host and made us feel welcome from the first moment we arrived! The water bottles, cookies, and coffee were a wonderful welcome gift (and of course, we loved seeing her adorable puppy Darcy too!) The apartment was well furnished, comfortable, quiet, and in a wonderful location to lots of wonderful restaurants and, of course, coffee! We absolutely loved staying there and hope to come back and soon! Overall, this was the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in! Barbara made us feel welcome. The apartment is new and very clean. It was wonderful to have a useable kitchen as I cooked several times, she even lent me some flour when I needed it! The neighborhood had coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants and bakeries all within a short walk. The con for us was that there is a lot of construction happening on the street so it was noisy early in the mornings and no laundry availability.  But we did love playing with Darcy! We had a wonderful stay in Ballard. The apartment was cosy, clean and well stocked kitchen. Barbara was very helpful, she helped out in every way and we highly recommend this place. Would definately stay here again! This was our third AirBNB and each has exceeded our expectations.  Barbara\\'s apartment could not have suited our needs any better.  Everything about it was very nice and very thoughtful.  We hope to visit the area again before long and we may even have to plan the dates around the availability of Barbara\\'s apartment.   \\r\\nBarbara, thanks again for everything!!! We stayed at Barbara\\'s Ballard Garden Apartment for almost a week while our boat was in the shipyard in Ballard.  Barbara was excellent with communication, and her wonderful apartment was exactly as described on Airbnb.  The space is clean, open, and wonderfully kept.   Barbara provided special touches like homemade cookies and locally roasted organic coffee.  The neighborhood is super quiet, and there are plenty of fun things within easy walking distance (parks, groceries, restaurants, locally owned movie theater, Old Ballard pubs, Ballard Locks, Sunday Farmer\\'s Market, etc).  Next time we need a place to stay in Ballard, Barbara\\'s place is at the top of our list!  Thanks so much Barbara!       Barbara\\'s place was lovely and clean and we enjoyed our stay.  Barbara was very helpful, thorough, and available for us.  Parking was a cinch and the bed is comfy.  Plus we enjoyed her super cute puppy. Taru was extremely welcoming, warm and professional.  The apartment was a perfect fit for our 5 night stay in Ballard.  It was everything we had hoped for.  A nice sized space for both my husband and I to work independently, a fully appointed kitchen for meal preparation, and a warm and cozy feel for when we needed our down time.  Any time we visit Ballard, we hope to stay again.  Thanks for the hospitality, Barbara and Taru! Barbara\\'s apartment is located in the lovely and cool Ballard area. Quiet neighbourhood, yet lots of great coffee shops, restaurants, vintage shops, etc in easy walking distance. The ground-level apartment was warm and welcoming, with our own entrance to this beautifully remodelled 1903 home and snacks ready for us. Comfortable bed, full kitchen and spotlessly clean. From the moment we made our first inquiry until we left, Barbara provided helpful, friendly and clear information about our stay. Thank you! Barbara made me feel so welcome! The apartment is so comfortable, clean, and well appointed that I wished I were staying longer. It\\'s also larger that I thought it would be. It\\'s truly a gem. We had a great stay in this beautiful apartment in Ballard! Barbara was a great host and the apartment was warm, clean, and well-organized with everything we could possibly need. Thank you! This was a fantastic place in an excellent neighborhood, exactly as advertised. Walking distance to great restuarants and fun pubs, very quiet and neat.  Easy taxi rides downtown. Overall an excellent experience.  Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a cool place to hang in Seattle, without having to deal with downtown.  myself and 2 others came to town to visit friends who live in ballard and we wanted a nice, centrally located place in the neighborhood to return to at the end of each night.  this apartment was right in the middle of downtown ballard and worked out great.  it had everything we needed for the weekend, Ginny met us upon arrival and made herself available if there was anything we needed even, and we had good communication leading up to our arrival.  shops, restaurants, coffee shops, and bars line the street, and it\\'s all very walkable once you are in the area.  sunday morning farmer\\'s market is about a 1 minute walk from the front door, and runs all along the main drag and was very impressive!  we did not hit up what i think many would call the big name seattle attractions (ie. space needle, experience music museum, pikes place) because that was not our focus for the trip.  we did walk over to the chittendam locks and watched the boats and the salmon runs, and that was cool.  if you are looking for an urban setting, cultured neighborhood, with great nightlife, fantastic food options, and less crowd than you\\'d run into in capital hill or downtown, you\\'d really enjoy staying here. A very nice apartment, right in the middle of a popular neighbourhood. There are good restaurants and bars just outside the door and the centre of town is only a 10 minute drive away. Ginny was very hospitable and did her best to make sure we were comfortable. Thoroughly recommended! The apartment was beautiful and very comfortable, very functional.  The neighborhood was full of fun, interesting places to eat, shop and listen to music all within walking distance.  The apartment is also very close to downtown Seattle so it was a quick drive to the Pike Place Market and Seattle\\'s City Center.  Ginny welcomed us and was very responsive to text messages during our stay.  The only challenge we had was finding parking on the weekend (Th-Sat) but to be fair, it was also the weekend before Seattle\\'s Seafair.   Ginny\\'s lovely apt sits right in the middle of the action in lively, colorful Ballard. We were not able to arrive until the evening, still, she was out on her stoop enjoying the night air & greeted us warmly. When we let ourselves into the apt, we were ready to move in! Colorful art fills all the walls & the decor was cozy. We were in town for our son\\'s wedding, but found time to hit some coffee shops, restaurants, & galleries. It was fun to be close to Hotel Ballard & The Tractor Tavern, yet in the evenings, close the bedroom door, block the sound, & read a book or have a conversation on the cool, tiny, gardened back porch. There\\'s no AC, but because you\\'re close to the water, the mornings & evenings are cool. Ginny provides fans in apt if like me, you tend to \"run hot\". I was amazed that I could open the bedroom door out to the garden porch in the evening, and get a breeze w/no bugs! Delightful. Parking can be a bear if like us you find yourself transporting multiple items, but we actually found street parking relatively close. We\\'d love to visit again, for more than 2 days, and take in all that Ballard has to offer. Thank you, Ginny, for sharing this lovely comfy hip space. Ginny was a great host.  She was very accommodating when my arrival time was delayed significantly (bad I-5 traffic plus some car trouble), and asked several times if I needed anything else.  I also had a few nice chats with her about the neighborhood, including some parking tips I passed on to a local friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment itself is beautiful, and right in the middle of the action in Ballard.  It was bright, clean and well-stocked with linens.  A bonus is that it\\'s just 2 blocks from the Sunday farmers market.   Apartment is great, exactly as advertised -- cozy but very comfortable one bedroom with a pull-out couch in living space big enough to sleep two teenagers.  Ginny very accommodating and easy to work with -- our flight was early and she even made an effort to get us into the apartment early.  And location in right in the heard of Ballard can\\'t be beat. This exciting place was in the heart of Ballard with lots of great eateries, pubs and bakeries.  the place is very nicely furnished.   I was in my element here amidst the wonderful artwork and fresh orchids and the whole joie de vivre of this cozy nest that looks down on the hubbub and \"scene\" below. Ideally situated, this \"pied a terre\" is just a hiccup away from all the conveniences and the action/shops, and it was a fun, invigorating walk to the historic Ballard locks which where cool to see. The Golden Gardens park, where we attended a wedding reception, was a short distance and a fabulous scenic spot for picnics and all kinds of beach fun (and we had stellar summer weather!) The apartment layout is such that one can look out on the street or get away from it all in the back bedroom or on the sweet little back porch. Loved the historic aspect of the neighborhood and building, too! All in all, Ginny was a wonderful host and this was a great experience.  Great location and apartment! We loved our stay here.  We had an excellent experience staying at Ginny\\'s apt.  It was exactly as described and Ginny is a wonderful host. We were working in Ballard for 2 weeks and the location was perfect.  On Sunday we loaded up on food for the week at the Farmers Market held one block away. With so many restaurants and bars within a 2 minute stroll that we mostly dined out though.   We look forward to returning we are not working and have recommended Ginny\\'s apartment to family and friends.\\r\\n We loved this lovely little artist studio in a bustling part of town! We really enjoyed staying here in the beautifully lit loft. The area does get a little loud with street sounds (which we didn\\'t mind), but it\\'s probably best for fun seekers, not solitude seekers. Ginny has tons of linens and things to make you feel cozy and restaurants and entertainment are just feet away. The apartment was definitely one of my favorite! Ginny was able to accommodate my guests who happened to arrive earlier than expected so I was unable to meet her personally at check-in. But, from our conversations she seemed very sweet and helpful. \\r\\nThe apartment is exactly as pictured, and is centrally located within walking distance to many bars, restaurants, and shops. Ginny had everything we could need already in the apt during our stay that I didn\\'t really need to ask her for anything. I definitely want to return again.    Ballard is our favorite neighborhood to stay in and this apartment is in the middle of Ballard. We didn\\'t touch our car all weekend which was great. Ginny was a great host and it was amazing to be surrounded by her incredible artwork. The exposed bricks and high windows and back shared balcony were charming. Ginny generously gave us a late check out Sunday to accommodate strolling the farmers market which is 2 blocks down the street. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe one thing to mention is that since it is in such a great location it can be noisy.  I thought that only the front of the apartment was lively however on one of the nights the bar next door\\'s back patio made the back bedroom quite loud. I slept with earplugs and with the fan on to dull out the noise. \\r\\n Everything about our stay here was excellent. The apartment is exactly as pictured in the listing--sunny, bright, clean, cozy, and charming. We were three New Yorkers in town for a friend\\'s wedding and staying here was the perfect choice. Ballard is a neighborhood with lots of shops, amazing restaurants, and a farmers market on Sundays along Ballard Avenue. All of this is walking distance. I had the best sashimi I\\'ve ever had just down the street. The waterfront is also a short walk away. You head down there to see the locks, watch the boats, and enjoy the green space. To get around to other parts of the city, we used Uber, which was very affordable, but were also told the buses were easy to learn too.\\r\\n\\r\\nGinny was an excellent host. She was timely with her responses, and every interaction we had to have with her went very smoothly. To describe this as a charming artist\\'s loft is an understatement. The apartment is filled with beautiful art and objects raised to the level of art. We hope we are lucky enough to get a chance to stay here in the future. The apartment is in a great location in Ballard. We walked everywhere from here, even to the bus stop for a ride to the Space Needle (Chihuly Glass, really). We set the heat to be just right for us after a day in the rain, warm and toasty!  Sunday was sunny and lots of light shone thru the living room but not in the bedroom, so we could sleep in late. Sunday market just steps away. We had a great time and will return to stay in this way cool digs.  Our experience at Ginny\\'s apt in Ballard was fantastic!  Ginny was a great communicator and made sure that we had all the information we needed prior to arrival, she also checked in with us during our stay.  The apartment is colorful and artsy, cozy and warm, full of charm and located right in the middle of the best part of Ballard.  As other reviews mention, there will be a bit of evening noise below on a Sat night, yet I had my earplugs since I was sleeping in the living room and that\\'s the point of staying there to be amidst all the activity.  My parents slept in the back bedroom and it was quiet for them.   We enjoyed exploring the Sunday Farmers market, ate at some delicious restaurants and watched the Seahawks game from Bad Alberts. We look forward to coming back to stay here again next summer.  Such a lovely 3 days!  Thanks Ginny. Such a cute apartment in the heart of Ballard. Fabulous location, charming funky-chic decor. A wonderful place to stay.  Amazing location and adorable apartment. It felt like we\\'d moved right into the neighborhood--totally at home, even just for the weekend. Ginny was a fantastic host - she was quick to respond to my last-minute reservation and offered great tips on what to see in the area during my stay. The apartment is stunning with high ceilings and lots of exposed brick. I really enjoyed my stay and would come again. If you\\'re in the area, I highly recommend booking here. Wonderful location and charming home! The perfect Seattle experience within walking distance to bars, restaurants, the locks, and Market Street in Ballard!\\r\\nVery cozy apartment and comfortable for 4 people. Ginny was wonderful to work with. Great apartment and even better location! Ginny made everything so convenient. Would highly recommend.  Great spot. Loved the design, art, location, and overall sensibility. Cozy and comfortable  Ginny\\'s place was a perfect little landing space for our family during the craziness of graduation week. With our changing flow of family and friends, having a keypad number rather than a key was SO very convenient. The apartment is so tiny but somehow never seemed to feel cramped! We greatly appreciated the thoughtful touches throughout, like the water purifier, the peppermint tea bags. The porch is charming, but connects into a neighbor\\'s apartment, which was rather confusing. Our wifi service was never very strong, but for the most part we were too busy to care. Ballard is one of our favorite Seattle neighborhoods and this location was great! Ginny sent us a heads-up about the Sunday Farmer\\'s Market, which was a fun way to spend our afternoon. We had the windows open in the 80* weather (with the fans on, this kept the apartment at a very comfortable temperature) and the live music from the Tractor Tavern across the street drifted in. Almost wish we had stayed one more night to enjoy the San Cisco concert from the comfort of Ginny\\'s sofa! (Or come a day earlier for the Monday night square dance!) Thanks for a beautiful stay! This apartment was very comfortable for a month stay while I was working in the area. The neighborhood was fabulous! Farmer\\'s market a block away on Sundays and some of Seattle\\'s best restaurants within walking distance.  The blooming orchids in the windows and flowers and herbs on the balcony were a nice touch.  Sometimes the street below could be a little noisy, but the bedroom in the back was very quiet. I would highly recommend it to get the real old Ballard neighborhood experience!  We loved the location of this Airbnb. It is exactly how it looks in the pictures although it was much smaller than it looks in pics. Much more suitable for 2 people. Internet service was poor which made it difficult to plan day trips and transit. Ginny was friendly.  The place was great and with a lot of character. Both location and house was great, I felt like I was at my friend\\'s house. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Great location in Ballard. Very cute apartment. Need to move furniture to use sofabed as it is  a bit cramped. Real flatware rather than plastic would have been nice.  Would stay again. We had such a nice time in this art-filled, cozy apartment in Ballard.  It was a fabulous location - walking distance to so many great restaurants, shops and cafes... the locks.  We felt like locals for the weekend! \\r\\n The location and place were great! If you really want to get an feel for what downtown Ballard is like, this is the place to stay. It is within walking distance of everything you want to go to. We walked to the locks, local coffee shops, and more. I recommend staying here to anyone traveling to Ballard.  Ginny\\'s Studio was charming and in the heart of Ballard.  The location was exactly where we wanted to be and walking everywhere was a breeze.\\nThe balcony was colorful, whimsical and fun.\\n The neighborhood and the apartment were perfect! The location cannot be beat for live music, coffee shops, restaurants and unique shopping. Ginny has an adorable place and we felt right at home!  I highly recommend this place for a comfy stay in Seattle! Nice trip with lovely apartment, Ginny was very nice and helpful. The location is quite good with excellent coffee shops. :)  Ginny was very forthcoming with information and helpful tips for the stay. The space was exactly as it appeared - absolutely lovely and centrally located in Ballard. Highly recommend! Lovely home, very comfortable and attractive, with great hospitality. Muna left us some nice treats and kept in contact to see if there was anything we needed to make our stay better I absolutely LOVED the place it was perfect for a girls getaway. It was my first time at a B&B so it was different but I was definitely not disappointed. The beds were so comfortable and soft and fluffy. The decor was very nice and homey. Way better than the hotel. We got parking really close to the place we were staying so that was a plus. Communication was great and she was there when we needed anything answer all in all a 10 out of 10! Muna is an amazing host! She is very nice and prepared everything for us. We will come back if we visit Seattle again. A couple of buddies and I stayed here for a trip to go to a Seahawks game and see some old college friends. Muna was absolutely incredible going through the booking process and during our stay. She was incredibly flexible and made sure we had everything we needed. The champagne and chocolates were also a nice touch! The condo itself is very inviting and spacious as we fit three comfortably and it is in the heart of Ballard. Would love to stay here in the future! Thanks so much for a wonderful time! Muna was a perfect hostess for her gorgeous condo. She prepared many personal touches to the condo that made my visiting brother and his daughters feel very welcome, and certainly made all the difference for them to stay at an Airbnb versus a hotel.  The condo has a great view of the surrounding community, with a little patio as well.  The condo was very clean and well organized and we would definitely recommend her place to others. Relaxing stay! I was in a tough transitory state, and Jayne put me up last minute, gave me space to sleep, made me tea, and was kind enough to inquire after me well-being. She\\'s a solid lady! The room is well-kept with a big tv and all kinds of entertainment. Futon was actually comfortable. Would stay here again.  Stayed for three nights at Jayne\\'s place. Jayne is a great host and knows all the good places in the city. Ballard is a lovely neighborhood with great restaurants in walking distance. I definitively recommend to stay here. By bus you easily get to downtown in less than 30min. Make sure to ask Jayne about her personal favourite sights and restaurants! This awesome spot in Ballard was our first stop for a week in Seattle. The location and host can\\'t be beat!\\nJayne was so accommodating and friendly, she provided incredible directions to her home from the airport (we didn\\'t have a car), as well as tips for getting around the neighborhood. She gave us some of the best tips for places to eat--we love food and thanks to Jayne we ate some of our favorite meals in Seattle in her neighborhood.\\nWe got around just fine without a car! It\\'s about a 10-15 minute walk to downtown Ballard, unending bars and cafés and restaurants. It\\'s the place to be in Seattle! Quick 10 minute bus ride to Fremont, etc... Perfect location on a gorgeous neighborhood street!\\nThe room was comfortable and secluded with a view of the garden. All things considered, this room is a bargain for the experience. A great place to come back to and unwind after a day of exploring. \\nJayne was our first host of the trip and she set a great tone! Can\\'t wait to see her and her adorable doggy when we visit Seattle again! Thanks for the great times! Jayne is a wonderful, warm and courteous host. She has a bevy of knowledge about good bars and restaurants in the area and accommodated all of our needs. She\\'s very friendly and my boyfriend and i had fun chatting with her, but she knew to respect our space and privacy when we were tired and ready to relax. The room was very clean and private with a comfortable bed, and came equipped with an enormous apple TV. Also she has an adorable dog! We were only there for one night but i wish we could have stayed longer. Would definitely recommend a stay at Jayne\\'s! Jayne was a lovely and accommodating host for my quick overnight visit in Seattle. I was able to leave my bags with her before check-in and after check-out while I explored the city. The D-Line to downtown is just around the corner and I was able to spend the weekend in town without needing a car, walking to breakfast and dinner spots and catching the bus into town. Spent some time in the evening chatting with Jayne and her neighbor - really comfortable and easy conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was as listed and provided all the amenities I needed. I\\'d definitely stay with Jayne again and highly recommend her home for a visit when you\\'re in town. Holy moly! This place was great! Sort of a man cave with a bed. Jayne and Tyke were great hosts. They allowed me space and privacy, but also were happy to let me join in for some Downtown Abbey. The location is great as it is only a 10 minute walk to Market st with all the great restaurants and shopping Ballard has to offer.  Great accommodations. Very cool mancave basement room especially with the huge TV. Lots of privacy if you need it, but Jayne was more than friendly and willing open to hanging out if that\\'s what you\\'re in to.  Jayne and Tyke were awesome people! Extremely considerate and accommodating. The room was perfectly comfy for a weekend getaway and a great location for roaming Ballard. Buddy their dog was a great added bonus. Our favorite part of our stay was sharing some wine and chatting with the two of them. Very highly recommended!! The location was great; the house was on a quiet street, and within walking distance of the places I was visiting in Ballard.\\r\\n\\r\\nJayne, Tyke, and Buddy were extremely welcoming hosts.  I\\'m very thankful to have met them and wish them well. Jayne was a great host, and the room was exactly as described. I was only in town for a brief while and didn\\'t spend much time there (at all really!) but the little touches like the complimentary toiletries, fresh towels,  huge TV in bedroom and AppleTV make this Airbnb option worthwhile for a single or couple. The room is really massive.  Her and her partner were really warm and friendly and gave great recommendations for many bars and restaurants around Ballard - of which there are many options, so it\\'s helpful to have a local guide you through. They even knew where the really, really late night options for food were. \\r\\nAlso, Buddy the dog is adorable.    Perfect - minutes walk to central Ballard, clean and comfortable.  Jayne ensured solid communication and the place was open and exactly what I needed for a visit!!! Awesome place, awesome hosts. I was there for just a night, but Jayne and her husband helped us find our way around Seattle and made us feel very welcome in their home. The room is really nice, huge TV with all the fixins. Thanks guys! What a wonderful mini vacation!  We had such a nice stay at Jayne\\'s place.  It was easy to communicate with her leading up to check in, and they made us feel very welcome and comfortable.  The room was quiet and clean-just what we needed after a day on the town!  They gave us great recommendations of places to eat and were great hosts.  Plus, their house is in a quiet spot but an easy walk to downtown Ballard. Jayne and her husband were very friendly and welcoming. They gave us helpful directions and suggestions for local eats and attractions. The room they have on the lower floor was nice, comfortable and warm with a giant TV! Thanks, Jayne! Jayne and her husband are great hosts and I really enjoyed staying at  their place! We even had some time to chat and they\\'re friendly and welcoming people. Recommended. I felt welcomed right away. The room was very comfortable and I had a  very nice night\\'s sleep. Had all the amenities I was looking for. I will definitely be checking back on future trips. Thank you  The hosts were very generous with their time.  They enjoyed talking with us as we did with them.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe basement room was comfortable. Because the bathroom was  upstairs it is inconvenient for  older people or those of any age who need to use the bathroom at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood was very nice. We had a great time as Jayne\\'s guests!  Our room was not only large, clean and bright, but also remained cool during a surprisingly warm summer weekend.  The futon was comfortable and the room nicely appointed.  The neighborhood is wonderful, full of shops and restaurants and terrific coffee shops, and only a short walk away you can hop a bus into downtown Seattle.  We had no transportation trouble even though we did not rent a car during our stay.  We were made to feel entirely welcome, both in our private space and in sharing their kitchen and bathroom.  We greatly appreciated our visit with Jayne, her husband Tadgh, and their friendly dog Buddy. We had a great time in Seattle with Jayne and Tidgh. They were lovely, laid back, and welcoming hosts, and we really enjoyed chatting with them in the garden. The basement room was just fine for us. It looks as described in the photos, spacious with a futon. The location is a two block walk from the bus and walkable to the shops and bars in Ballard. I had rented the basement room in Jayne\\'s house for 1 night. My experience was short but great. Jayne and her husband are warm and friendly. The futon mattress in the room is great (especially if you prefer a hard mattress) and comes with clean sheets. the shared bathroom shower is great.  I had a wonderful time staying with Jayne.  Her and Tadgh were warm and inviting, as was Buddy.  She even laid out a small toiletry spread for me, in case, I had forgotten anything from home.  She was available to answer any questions and gave recommendations for places to visit, even informing me about places to visit in Vancouver, the next stop on my trip.  The room was clean and well appointed, and the bed was comfortable.  You really could not ask for anything more during a stay.  I would recommend this room to a friend without question. Jayne and her husband were delightful. The room and accommodations were what we expected. I felt safe and comfortable in the room, house and neighborhood. I would stay here again. These two were really great! They made sure we were comfortable, offered oodles of suggestions, engaged us in good chats, and always had coffee available in the morning. Definitely a super host! Jayne\\'s home was everything the listing made me hope it would be. She is an extremely welcoming, courteous and helpful host that I\\'d recommend to anyone passing through the area. Very close to Woodland Park Zoo, which is where we went, as well as a very short drive to downtown. \\r\\nCan\\'t thank you enough, Jayne! Jayne is extremely flexible and it helped a lot as our schedule was little  tricky. Her house is in a really nice neighbourhood so getting in and around is very easy. I would highly recommend Jayne\\'s house.  \\r\\nWe had a very restful night.  The room was clean and neat and the bed was very comfortable.  Jayne and her husband were gone and we were almost ready to retire so we did not visit much but Jayne was gracious in our desire for a fan.  Coffee was really nice the next morning.   Jayne\\'s a very accommodating host. She left clear instructions on how to access the house if she was out (or asleep). Our estimated arrival time changed several times (delayed flight) and Jayne was very flexible. The room/house/bathroom were all very cozy and clean. I would definitely recommend staying here.  We had a wonderful time staying with Jayne. Her and Tadgh were warm and inviting, as was Buddy.  They were available to answer any questions and gave good recommendations for places to visit. Jayne was indeed a superhost. She made me and my boyfriend feel more than welcome to enjoy our stay in her splendidly kept Seattle basement room. I rarely feel that I have the comforts of home truley on vacation, but Jayne and her friendly husband made sure we felt both accomdated and comfortable. Would rate (phone number hidden) stars if possible! Our room is large and comfortable, set in a well-lighted basement, with a window and door to the back garden.  The house Is appointed with tasteful English/Irish artifacts.  Jayne is very friendly and made us feel at home.   The bathroom is shared, but it is convenient, and has everything we possibly need.  The nice, thick and soft towels are much appreciated.   We highly recommend it. The one-night stay at Jayne\\'s place was great. She is super friendly and the place is exactly as described. We had a wonderful stay in downtown Ballard!  The apartment was beautiful, almost brand new, and very comfortable.  We were close to tons of restaurants and entertainment as well as being just a short drive to all the downtown attractions.  Thank you for your hospitality! The location is great with many restaurants and shops. The Shishole Marina and other landmarks are near by.  The host Jennifer is a very pleasant and attentive person .  The apartment  is very clean and the bed is comfortable for 2.  There is a wonderful terrace on the roof to relax and BBQ too. I am very happy we chose this place. This was a wonderful experience for us! The place was even nicer than it was described. It was exceptionally clean and modern. The appliances (stove, refrigerator, washing machine, dryer, etc.) all looked new, and all worked perfectly.  The bed was very comfortable, plenty of pillows, and the apartment was furnished beautifully and tastefully. There were clean dishes, utensils, pots, pans, coffee maker - perfectly set up.  Plenty of closet space. Iron, ironing board, hangers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe were close to everything on Market Street (easily walkable).  No problems with noise at night, and there was a great rooftop grill and club room where we cooked a dinner one night. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever we had questions, our hosts communicated with us right away - I don\\'t think we ever waited longer than a minute for a response, after sending a text.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a great time, and a great experience - we\\'d definitely stay there again.  My main concern in this review is that I might be leaving out something wonderful - I\\'m positive, though, that I\\'m not leaving out anything negative, because, sincerely, there weren\\'t any negatives! It was a pleasure to meet Jennifer and stay in Ballard. The apartment building is brand new and located within walking distance of terrific bars, restaurants, and shopping. The apartment was exactly as pictured--and included a lovely \"welcome book\" with recommendations for eating & sightseeing. I would certainly stay here again and recommend it to friends! Jennifer always answered texts promptly and met us with the keys. She was also very prompt and flexible about picking up the keys .\\r\\nIt might be helpful, like some vrbos to have a system where the renter could check in and out on their own.  Jennifer\\'s place was absolutely PERFECT for exploring downtown Ballard. We could easily walk to tons of restaurants, bars, shops and the Sunday farmer\\'s market. The apartment was super clean, comfortable and the building had great amenities like a rooftop and social room. Jennifer was very friendly, easy to work with and got back to us right away about any logistics. We had such a wonderful trip.  The apartment was great! It\\'s a new apartment and is actually much nicer than it appears in photos. The location is great if you plan to hang around in Ballard. There are tons of restaurants within walking distance. If you need to go downtown it\\'s a bit of a drive. Jennifer was quick to respond to questions, and when she wasn\\'t able to meet me to drop off the key, she sent a friend in her place.  Nice modern, brand new apartment. Great location -- all as advertised. Stephanie was very helpful and made the stay seamless for us. We had a lovely time in the Urban Oasis; it is very convient to Ballard, transit, and grocery stores. Stephanie was easy to work with, and we found the apartment building safe and quiet. We had a wonderful stay in Ballard. The apartment is located within walking distance of a number of great restaurants (including phenomenal oysters) and bars, which was great. The apartment was very clean and cozy and was overall a great place to spend a weekend in Seattle. Although we did not meet, Stephanie was very helpful and made sure we were able to get into/check out of the apartment in an easy way. She also suggested a few restaurants, which was much appreciated! Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend for others! Thanks, Stephanie! We had a wonderful stay in Seattle, and Stephanie\\'s apartment helped to make our stay all the more enjoyable! The parking situation and access to the building was a bit confusing at first but we mastered it in no time! The apartment was exactly as advertised and the location is ideal! Stephanie was great at responding to all communication in a timely manner and was quick to answer any questions we had. Thank you! Great place and a great host.  Would stay there again anytime.  It was a great neighbourhood super close to good restaurants and easy transit.The place is quite and clean. Elin was a great host! Her home is clean and modern, and the bed was quite comfortable. The neighborhood is great -- there are a lot of restaurants, bars, and shops within walking distance.  We had a great 2-nite stay at Elin\\'s. We had just landed in Seattle (from San Francisco),and she was very helpful in getting us there. The space was very private, even though it was in her townhouse- we had  a different floor than the main living area was on, w/our own bathroom (and use of kitchen if we wanted). This was located within walking distance to Ballard, which is a very hip neighborhood w/lots of restaurants and cool nightime scene. The price was very affordable and half of what we would have paid at a hotel. It was our first experience staying in someone\\'s home and was a very pleasant one. We actually spent the next 6 nites on our trip using AirBnB rooms because of our time at Elin\\'s. Would totally recommend to any one wanting to check out Seattle- great transit system too. Fantastic place to stay! Short walk to Ballard attractions and restaurants, as well as bus lines downtown. The room and private bathroom were immaculately clean and the bed very comfortable. Elin is a kind and attentive host. Would definitely stay here again! Elin\\'s home is comfortable, clean, and in a fabulous location. The bed was nice and firm (my favorite!) and the balcony off the room was a lovely connection to the crisp weather the weekend I was there. Elin has done a great job describing her place genuinely well and I highly recommend staying here if you\\'re interested in exploring Ballard. Our week stay at Elin\\'s  was fabulous.  The Room was very well done.  The bed was so comfortable and the room very homey and inviting. There was also access to a well equipped kitchen. The location is perfect if you are wanting the Ballard downtown area as well as a walk away from the locks and beautiful botanical garden.  We are planning to stay on our next visit as well.  Thank you Elin. Great stay these three days.  Bed was super comfy and the little desk in the room was perfect for working during the day.  Great location within walking distance to food and coffee.  Great communication from Elin.  Highly recommend. This room was outfitted like a very nice hotel suite. I enjoyed my stay there. Very comfortable bed/linens. Quiet. Great location. Parking was a little tricky, but could always find a spot within two blocks. Elin communicated with us and told us our door code.  It worked well for us except once and we texted her and she took care of that.  The queen sized bed was comfortable and having a balcony was a plus.  The house is located near the heart of Ballard which was very important to us as our son lives nearby and we could walk to everything.  The room temp was comfortable and the few times we ran into Elin, she was very friendly and helpful. The location was great and close to  Ballard core and bus lines to Fremont and downtown. The room itself was cozy; the bed was super comfortable. I liked the little balcony outside too. Elin was very kind and let us keep our bags in the house even after checking out, as we had a late flight. Would stay here again! My boyfriend and I enjoyed our time at Elin\\'s lovely tow home. It was cozy and in a really great neighborhood. Would recommend to anyone visiting Seattle who wants to stay out of the thick of the city and experience how living in Seattle can actually be. Listing was as described and was in a very convenient location to great bars and restaurants in Ballard.  We enjoyed our stay and the price was very reasonable. Shower items (towels, soap, shampoo) were provided as well!  The bed and the pillows we\\'re a little stiff for my liking but not enough to loose sleep. I was in town for a week-long work event in the area and thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Elin\\'s place. The private room had everything I needed to get work done and the furnishings were quite comfortable, tidy, and clean. The area is walkable to all the conveniences of Market Street and my personal favorite place for breakfast, Portage Bay (just two blocks away). If I\\'m ever in town for a work event, I would stay here again. We had an awesome stay in Elin\\'s Airbnb, she was an awesome host! The room was fantastic, clean and very comfortable. Location was incredibly convenient as well, as it is just a couple blocks off Ballard\\'s main street. The keypad is a nice addition and was great since we came in from our flight quite late so it was nice being able to get in without having to wake anyone up. I would highly recommend staying here.  Elin\\'s place is wonderful, I was lucky to be able to stay there for 8 nights and I wish I booked a longer stay.\\nI rented the master bedroom with my own bathroom.\\nHer house is spotless, very welcoming, very quiet. The bed is super comfortable, I was able to rest in a peaceful environment.\\nParking is pretty easy on the street. \\nElin is really nice and well educated young woman and she respects your privacy.\\nI would definitely stay at her place again and I highly recommend Elin\\'s house. Daniel was very welcoming and accommodating, and the house was great. It\\'s at the top of our list for our next family trip to Seattle. I loved staying in Kelly\\'s adorable apartment with her sweet cats that kept me company. Walking distance to a ton of delicious and fun restaurants and bars, this neigborhood is great and easily accessible from other parts of Seattle. Kelly was a wonderful host - filling the room with an abundance of snacks and amenities and thoughtfully offered helpful advice and directions to get to know the area.  Kelly was a fantastic host.  She responded to our request within minutes and had great communication leading up to our stay.  We picked her place because it was in the heart of the Ballard neighborhood.  We were just a few blocks away from lovely bars and restaurants.  \\nThe room was just as pictured and even more!  A very comfortable bed with plenty of closet space. Kelly added lots of extras in the room such as snacks, bottled waters, toiletries and a coffee maker. She was friendly and easy to chat with and gave us good directions to all the hot spots down the block. A Five Star experience for a fraction of the price... I\\'d definitely visit again! Kelly was a gracious and wonderful host. Her space was very inviting, and her amenities in the room were truly a step above and beyond. Communication was great, and made the experience as good as it possibly could have been. It was so pleasant to sit down, and share conversation about my trip, and get good ideas of things to do from Kelly. Also, her movie room is really awesome.  The room was cute and cosy and was in a perfect Ballard location. Kelly was very welcoming and friendly and made us feel at home while also giving us space when needed. I would definitely recommend Kelly\\'s place - especially if you like hilarious cats. Kelly was pretty much the perfect host. And she has pretty much thought of everything. The room (and bed, most importantly) is comfortable, light (it\\'s a corner space with windows on two sides), and I appreciated the desk space, as I was in town to work. But Kelly goes beyond expectations. She has stocked a bottom drawer full of things you might need, from snacks to toiletries, all, it would seem, complimentary. There is an iron and small ironing board in the closet, which was again appreciated. There is tea, coffee, a coffee machine, and even a selection of pens and Seattle postcards. OK, if you don\\'t like cats or sharing the adjacent bathroom, then I can see this Airbnb might not be ideal. For everyone else though, this is a good value, excellently located, and utterly charming place to stay.  My boyfriend and I considered staying in a hotel for our anniversary weekend, and we both agree that Kelly\\'s place was better than any hotel we could have picked. From the moment she accepted our request to stay (which she did both promptly and kindly) we felt welcome in her home. Her apartment is literally the best apartment we have ever been in. It\\'s charming, beautifully decorated, warm, and bright. Kelly provides more amenities than most hotels, including snacks, coffee, and miscellaneous items like hair ties and deodorant. She also provided maps of Ballard and several books/lists listing local attractions and food. Before our visit, Kelly advised us to bring some warm clothes as her apartment got a little chilly at night, which proved to be good advice. We were never uncomfortable, however, thanks to the space heater and blankets provided in the guest room. We loved hanging out with her two cats Henry (who barely tolerated us) and Harlow (who we seriously considered cat-napping). Her projector is awesome; we watched \"American Hustle\" and \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (obviously!), and we easily could have spent the whole weekend holed up on her couch with her impressive DVD collection. Kelly herself is a wonderful host. She gave us plenty of space and privacy, but was also open to hanging out and talking with us. Playing with her cats and talking about movies with her was one of the highlights of our trip. We were impressed with how she communicated with us before the trip, giving us all the information we needed before we needed it. She responds quickly to messages and texts. The trip was fun, relaxing, and non-stressful. We would rent her guest room again in a heartbeat. Thanks for such an awesome experience, Kelly! Kelly was great a great host. She was very welcoming, and her place was clean and comfortable.  Street parking near her place was easy to find and we couldn\\'t have asked to be in a better location.  The house was in walking distance of some great coffee, food and shopping. If we went back to Seattle we know where we\\'d want to stay! Oh, and the cats were great too! Kelly\\'s home and our bedroom were lovely. Very clean and lots of charm! The bedroom had a variety of amenities like coffee and Seattle-related information. She was home when we got there, but was flexible in leaving a key outside for us since we didn\\'t know when we were arriving. The bedroom can get a little chilly, but two heaters were provided to heat it up! Also, it\\'s in a nice neighborhood and their are restaurants within walking distance. Overall a great experience.   Great experience at Party Central! It\\'s a cute little studio on the main drag in Ballard with everything you need to stay in the best part of Seattle. There\\'s live music all over the drag, so as long as you\\'re prepared for the vibrant night life, you\\'ll enjoy this place. We were in Seattle for the weekend to participate in my great friends wedding and Katelynn\\'s apartment made everything that much more special. Thank you Katelynn for hosting us in your home. We had a great experience, private apartment, walking distance to everything (including my friend\\'s wedding location!), cozy and comfortable. Katelynn was great to work with and communicated everything clearly and timely. She is kind and thoughtful (The \"In case you forgot something!\" Assortment of extra toothpaste, shampoo toothbrushes etc was a great touch!), we really appreciate and enjoyed our stay.  A great little apartment that fit the needs of my stay perfectly. Had an excellent overnight stay, and the host was readily available over email to answer any questions we had.  Katelynn was a great host. Very helpful and quick at answering questions. The space was clean and quiet. We love the Ballard area and her place was in a very convenient location to walk to stores, restaurants and the farmer\\'s market! Also a short drive to University Village, Downtown, Capital Hill etc. Thanks Katelynn! Katelynn was very responsive via Airbnb and text with our last minute reservation for Memorial Day weekend. Being that it was last minute we were back to back with a previous reservation and there wasn\\'t time for her to do an inspection or cleanup after the previous airbnbers, so it wasn\\'t a spick-and-span kind of arrangement. Sheets and towels were in the dryer so they were cleaned already, we just had to put them on the bed ourselves. The place was tidy, although visibly not entirely clean being that someone had just stayed there the night before. The neighborhood feels safe and cozy and in walking distance to the very entertaining Ballard streets and parking was a breeze. Since we were the last to stay in the apartment, we did our best to tidy things that may have been left behind by others before us that we didn\\'t use, like cleaned laundry. It\\'s a great neighborhood and place to stay, although we would have preferred it a bit cleaner and better prepared before our arrival, but for the length of time and short notice it was great for the price.  She was very communicative.  Everything was set up just as she said and It was a great experience.  We LOVED staying at Katie\\'s house!!! It is so adorable and impeccably clean. Katie and Dan were such warm hosts- they left us local beer and some snacks! And they gave us some helpful info about the neighborhood, which is fantastic with many restaurants, bars, and really cute shops. \\r\\n\\r\\nEvery room of the house is great, and we especially loved that the living room has a fireplace and record player which we were welcomed to use. We took advantage of that and had an amazing Washington experience. I\\'d definitely recommend this booking!! We had a great stay at Katie and Dan\\'s apartment over Thanksgiving holiday.  The beds were cozy, the kitchen was well stocked with all the necessary gadgets, and the location was perfect.  Just a five minute walk to the heart of Ballard, and right across the street from the Ballard Market, key in last minute food pick-ups.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOur only gripe was there was a condo construction site directly next door.  Construction began promptly at 7am every morning, making it impossible to get some extra sleep-in time on our vacation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely stay here again.   Katie\\'s place was in a fantastic location close to shops, great restaurants in Ballard and only a short distance to Freemont. \\r\\nThe house was very cosy with everything we needed\\r\\nAs mentioned in the description, parking is a little hard to find out the front of the house but no real big deal in adjoining streets.\\r\\n Great townhome right in the heart of Ballard, pictures are very accurate of the clean modern place.  Was impressed that the owner called me during my stay to check on everything.  The description accounts for the parking challenges, but only had to park down the street so no big deal.  If you are looking for a 2br near the center of Ballard, this is a great choice! Katie was a wonderful host.  We had great communication leading up to and during our stay.  She was wonderful about answering our questions quickly.  The house was amazing, cute and so comfortable!  The neighborhood conveniently within walking distance of a few restaurants and coffee! A very flexible and accomadating host.  She even left us a hospitality basket!  My family and I had a great time and felt right at home. Beautiful home and comfortable. Wish it was more walking distance to downtown ballard We had a wonderful trip and were lucky to stay in this lovely home! Everything was as described and the host was welcoming and helpful! It\\'s also in our favorite Seattle neighborhood. We\\'ll be back!  Katie & Dan\\'s house was perfect. Ideally located with everything you would need for a stay. It was spotlessly clean and tidy and in a lovely neighbourhood.  We didn\\'t actually meet our hosts but we asked many questions before and during our stay about where to eat and the best ways to travel downtown and they were extremely helpful throughout.  We were very impressed with Ballard itself. Great atmosphere about the place with lots of places to eat and some lovely shops. We visited the Woodland Zoo and Ballard Locks which are both nearby and definitely worth a visit and The Ballard Pizza Co was a great place to eat. Ballard market 2 minutes walk away was really good for groceries. We have no hesitation in recommending this house as somewhere to stay and would definitely use it again if we came back to Seattle. My family and I recently stayed in Katie\\'s town home and love it. It\\'s beautifully decorated, clean and actually a little bit roomier than the pictures make it seem. The beds were very comfy. We loved the location and neighbourhood and can\\'t wait to go back! Thanks for your help and hospitality Katie. My girlfriend and I had a very comfortable stay here with another couple. Everything was as described in the listing. Bonus points for the Stumptown coffee in the kitchen.\\n\\nWe were in town for a wedding so didn\\'t get to explore the immediate area, but it\\'s very close to the Walrus and the Carpenter and some other good restaurants. Discovery Park is about 5 minutes away by car. Twenty minute drive to downtown. \\n\\nKatie was incredibly responsive before and during the stay. \\n\\nI would stay here again. We really enjoyed our stay here.  Perfect size for me, my wife and our 2 kids.  The townhouse was very comfortable and Katie and Daniel make you feel right at home.  Katie was super responsive to any questions.  Fantastic hosts!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe couldn\\'t have asked for a better location.  An easy 10 minute walk to the heart of downtown Ballard and 5 minutes to all sorts of other amenities, restaurants and cafes.  Cafe Besalu has some of the best croissants you have ever tasted.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'ll be back! The Cute Cozy Townhome in Ballard was also very clean and comfortable... hotel-like.  We couldn\\'t have been happier!   Adorable space in an ideal location to explore downtown Ballard. Katie & Dan were great hosts, they checked in on us and were very responsive with questions. Highly recommended! Katie was very responsive to our initial booking request and all the follow-up questions we had. We coordinated our arrival easily and their home is a lovely town home in Ballard. We enjoyed the upstairs bedrooms w/ a jointly shared bath, making traveling with one of our parents easy and more cozy than two hotel rooms. The main floor with a living room and kitchen was nice to relax in during the evenings. Very clean and decorated nicely. We would enjoy a stay again!  We had a great experience at Katie\\'s townhome. Katie left us a welcome gift of local artisan popcorn and a bottle of wine... who doesn\\'t love that! The townhome is conveniently located so we were able to walk to all the restaurants, shops, and farmers market in Ballard. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend for anyone traveling to Seattle! Katie was very easy to work with and we really enjoyed this awesome location in Ballard. We would definitely stay again and have already recommended Katie\\'s home to our friends. Wir haben den Aufenthalt im Haus von Katie und Dan sehr genossen. Es ist alles sehr gemütlich, geschmackvoll und praktisch eingerichtet. Der Kontakt mit Katie war unkompliziert und sehr nett. Alles perfekt! Second leg of a trip to Vancouver and Seattle. Stayed for two nights.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie made everything really convenient! Although I never met her in person (we tried to but we got there late and something came up on her end), there was awesome communication and we were able to get in with no problem.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe wife and my mom loved the place! So cute and quaint! Instruments available to play and books on shelves and in cabinets. Wife also loved the selection of amenities and how the rooms were decorated! Happy wife happy life right?! \\r\\n\\r\\n2 queen bed were comfortable and neighborhood had a really great vibe. Awesome restaurants and bars right around the corner stretching for blocks! It also wasn\\'t as noisy as I thought it might have been at night. Very quiet except for small pockets of people walking by and chatting. Reminds me of Brighton/Allston area in Boston.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeattle is a very cool and hip and it\\'s reflected that while staying at Katie\\'s! Awesome experience and would recommend the next person. We had a wonderful time staying at Katie and Dan\\'s home. It\\'s very comfortable and has everything you need to make the stay enjoyable. The location is awesome, so close to everything in Ballard and not far from downtown. Garage parking was a definite plus.\\r\\nCommunication was easy and everything went very smoothly. We highly recommend staying here!  Katie and Dan were absolutely wonderful hosts! Their townhome has a very homey feel and is in such a great location. While staying there, our group was able to walk into Ballard, or take a quick drive to Fremont, Capitol Hill and Queen Anne. \\r\\n\\r\\nI look forward to staying in Katie and Dan\\'s townhome again! \\r\\n This townhouse was the best! My husband and dad stayed here during a short 2 night visit to Seattle but I could\\'ve seen myself living in this gem. The house was beautifully decorated and everything was clean and well organized. The floor plan and layout of the place maximized space and efficiency. Katie and Dan were great hosts and easy to communicate with. Dan met us at the house and gave us a tour before leaving us to our privacy. There was a private garage to house our car, which was super convenient. The house is located only a few blocks from the Ballard neighborhood, which had tons of great restaurants, bars, and shops. We absolutely loved staying here and would highly recommend it to anyone. Condo was super clean and beautiful.  My dad and I did a father daughter trip, and this was so perfect for us given the 2 bedrooms, kitchen, living room, etc.  Blankets, towels, pots / pans, etc. were all really good quality, and honestly just made you feel like home away from home.  It made you feel like you were staying at a really good friend\\'s house (who\\'s clean / neat / has nice stuff) and who completely trusted you with their place.  We had a car so location wasn\\'t a problem at all.  It was also great that there\\'s a market across the street, a gas station right next door, and an AMAZING biscuit / breakfast sandwich shop the next street over.  All in all, this airbnb was awesome and worth every penny.  Host was super responsive in communication and helpful.  My dad and I was supposed to head up to Vancouver but I forgot my passport and was delayed a night in Seattle while I waited for my passport to be shipped over.  I had to book an additional night last minute, which the host was accommodating.  They immediately noticed that I was overpaying for fees since I had to book another separate night and had refunded me the amount - all without me asking for it!  Honestly, 5 stars for such honesty; I truly felt so comfortable staying here and would highly recommend it. The town home was very comfortable and Katie and Dan left us a lovely welcoming note and some goodies. The house is filled with a wide variety of books, a piano and guitar, a well-equipped kitchen, and a nice layout for our small family.  The neighborhood is only a two-minute walk from the \"main street\" of Ballard with lots to do - restaurants, stores, parks, etc.  It is also near the main bus line into town.  It felt very safe.  We were there during an unusual heat spell, and there was no air conditioning, but there are balconies on both floors and good cross ventilation and fans. They left us a friendly note with their contact information, if we needed them.  They also left us some treats and a refrigerator that contained many basic items.    The house was nicely decorated.  The D bus was a few blocks away and takes you downtown to Pike\\'s Market.  There are 2 supermarkets within a short walk.  There is also a nice Italian restaurant about 2 blocks away on 15th.  We would recommend this accommodation and stay there again. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it to others or return ourselves.  The house was plenty of space, warm, welcoming, comfortable and clean/ tidy. The location was perfect for public transit to the city and walking to  restaurants and shopping. We loved Ballard !  The essence of an Airbnb !   Everything was warm and welcoming. Katie made sure we got settled in. Perfect experience! We were the first people to visit this very centrally located space near Ballard. They did all they could to get it ready in time for our arrival. Upon our arrival, we intended to simply drop off our bags and head out again. We were greeted pleasantly, and showed around the home. Chris gave us a brief history of the home, and recommended a few places to visit. When we returned from our gallivanting, we found a plate of freshly baked cookies waiting for us on the kitchen counter.   Chris was an excellent host. The house was just as described and with nice touches to make us feel at home. The neighborhood is excellent and a perfect place to stay if you want to relax or sight see in Seattle. Chris was communicative and very pleasant to work with. We\\'re already trying to plan when we can stay there again!  A charming home away from home! My husband and I stayed there for two nights with our 4-month-old baby and my parents. We didn\\'t get to spend much time at the house, but it was nice to relax there in the evenings. The house is in a great location in an interesting neighborhood, and Chris was a very responsive and accommodating host. There were cookies waiting for us when we arrived, as well as snacks, drinks and condiments in the kitchen, and a co-sleeper for the baby. The beds were comfortable and the linens nice and soft. We all slept well both nights -- even the baby!  Chris was a wonderful host! Right from the moment we landed in Seattle we had great communication with him. The house is a perfect blend of old, weathered historic building, chic and bohemian décor (great art!), and comfort. We didn\\'t get a chance to use the kitchen, but it was lovely.\\r\\nThe neighborhood is also pretty special. Highly recommend walking to cafe Besalu for pastries in the morning.\\r\\nThanks for a great first visit to Seattle!\\r\\n We stayed one night at the Ballard Bunkhouse and it was a wonderful experience. The house was clean and a perfect location. We walked to the Ballard area bars and had an amazing time. Chris was very attentive and helpful. He made our stay pleasant. We will definitely be staying there again on out next trip to Seattle.  This wonderful, quaint, little historic home was the perfect base for exploring Seattle! The location was close to the city with easy access via car or public transit, and within walking distance to cute shops and restaurants in Ballard. Chris was an excellent host, providing for all our requests while respecting our privacy. We arrived later than planned to the heat on and a cute bed for our pup. We would definitely stay again when we next visit Seattle! We arrived late into seattle as we travelled in from kelowna after work.  Chris was very considerate and set up the hideabed and a crib for my nephew for us.  There were cookies and snacks nicely laid out to welcome us as well.   The apartment was clean and comfortable.  I found it to be a little cold at this time of year so I might suggest to bring Jammie\\'s but overall we had a very good stay.  There is street parking but the street is very narrow and crowded... Perhaps ask about alternative parking in advance. :) Chris was so accommodating! He was very prompt with returning my messages, was flexible and understanding about check out time, and made us feel very comfortable. There were cookies waiting for us when we arrived and we loved the space! The beds were very comfortable, the house was well appointed, and we essentially just wanted to stay in the giant jacuzzi bathtub. Our stay was short but lovely and we would highly recommend this location to others! Chris was an amazing host - always making sure that all of the little things were taken care of - bottles of water, thermostat temps, snacks, clean linens ... A wonderful home in a great neighborhood! You can\\'t go wrong with this place. Thanks so much, Chris! Chris was a perfect host we hope to stay here again next time we are in Ballard.  We had a great stay here in Ballard! The location is excellent and the house is comfortable and historically cool. The tub is sweet. We stayed four nights, a group meeting up from Alaska and North Carolina for a family get together in Seattle. Nice location to stay because you can walk down to the restaurants/businesses/grocery stores in Ballard. Chris was a great host and came over late one night due to a plumbing issue and dealt with it quickly and kindly. Everything you need is at the house and your host will help you find anything you need or want to know about the area/city.  We had an incredible time staying at Chris\\' place.  The apartment has so much character which we loved.  Some previous guests had mentioned  in reviews that they were cold but we were very comfortable (I guess Chris has added another heater and it really works!).  The location is great, Ballard is a wonderful neighborhood.  We lived that there was parking in the alley and we also had very little trouble finding street parking during our stay.  Chris left snacks and pantry items for our arrival which was helpful and the kitchen is fully stocked if you like to cook (like me).  We enjoyed spending time with him and his son :)  Thanks for everything, we highly recommend this place!!  My friends and I had a wonderful stay at the Bunkhouse! It was charming, clean, and exactly as described. Ballard is a great neighborhood with plenty of bars, restaurants, and a supermarket within walking distance of the apartment. Although we did not get a chance to meet Chris, he was a consumate host. We greatly appreciated his willingness to accommodate our changing check-in and check-out times, and he thoughtfully set out a dog bed for our pooch. Very good communicator with a quick response time as well. We would definitely book again! it is good Chris, Thank you for a wonderful respite for my folks and I. The bunkhouse was just as advertised, and very warm and comfortable. The location was perfect for exploring Ballard, and it was easy to get into downtown Seattle from there. Most of all, I really appreciate how available you were to answer my questions and solve any issues that arose. Have a great New Year!\\r\\n Chris was very communicative and was very easy to reach. He made sure the house was warmed for us and that we had everything we needed. It was a nice plus to have a stocked pantry and extra toiletries available. The place heats up nicely and parking is also a nice plus. The house is a bit creeky (built in 1901) and is definitely one that has been extensively renovated. Expect a mish-mash of old and new furniture, but overall, a cozy place to stay. One thing to note: the indoor jet tub is very large (80 gallons) and the hot water tank is smaller than that. So, if you are looking to fill up the tank in one go, expect a warm experience. It takes about 25 minutes for the hot water to \"recharge.\" I booked a stay at Chris\\'s Ballard bunk house but was unable to make it for the trip. Chris was really understanding and helpful and made it so my friends were still able to stay there. They said that they really enjoyed their stay. I will definitely book with Chris again  The host was very responsive to all our communications. He offered early check in since no one had stayed the night before, and again offered late check out. On our arrival we found a large box of chocolates welcomed us. Parking was very limited on the street in front, but there was private parking in back that accommodated our two vehicles, a small SUV and large crew cab truck. Linens were clean and fresh and our stay was pleasant. All in all a very good value. My group had a pleasant stay in Chris\\' Ballard Bunkhouse. The location is excellent - a quick walk to the heart of Ballard - and the house was well-equipped. Although the house could use some updating, we had a very comfortable stay.  The bunkhouse is warm and inviting with charm and history. I love the showerhead(s) and the tall high ceilings with sky lights.  This space was perfect for our group of five: it is just as advertised, no surprises. We’re getting to be more seasoned airbnb users and here’s what matters: location (and parking), a warm and clean space with good beds, good linen (including enough towels and good pillows), more than one bathroom, and of  course, hot water (in a warm bathroom). And, it turns out, a well-equipped kitchen matters when we’re travelling as a group. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis place has all of the above, along with an accessible and responsive host who managed our expectations well. We were happy here, and we’ll be back. The home was in a great location but we were a little disappointed in the house itself.  While we understand that the house is old and that is part of it\\'s charm, we were not prepared for peeling and mismatched paint in the bathroom, door trim that fell off every time you walked by and really, really squeaky beds.  The sound of people upstairs coming in at midnight was incredibly loud and none of us slept too well the first night.  Chris was very sweet to leave a history of the house, chocolates and coffee but I would not stay here again. Great location in Ballard neighborhood. Walkable to bars and restaurants but the house is quiet at night. I was able to speak to Chris upon my arrival and he was very helpful giving me suggestions for food in the neighborhood. Very kind host!  This was my second stay at the Ballard Bunkhouse, and it was great. Chris added a heater in the breakfast nook area, and it helped keep the whole unit nice and toasty. The pantry and fridge were stocked with some goodies and food, and plenty of fresh towels and linens. Great location, walkable to a number of great places in downtown Ballard. I loved Staying at the Bunkhouse it had everything you could need and more. And Chris was great and accommodating with our last minute planning. Thank you so much Chris! We will be back soon!  We arrived a bit early and we had the pleasure to meet Chris, he made us feel welcomed and answer all of our questions about the house. The house has a lot of historical value and much of its deco and feel is being preserved by Chris. Be prepared for sliding wood doors, a grandma rocker chair, and a tile curtainless tub.  The location was great within 10 minutes of downtown, parking was good with 1 dedicated parking spot and plenty street parking. There was a little of noise transfer from upstairs but nothing too loud. There was enough kitchenware for everyone plus a K brewing machine. The washer and dryer was useful to us.   It was comfortable and fairly quiet, in an old house sort of way. (It doesn\\'t have the muffled quiet of a big motel.) it would be an especially nice place to stay if you wanted to be there for several days, able to relax and prepare as many of your own meals as you (website hidden) in every room, making it easy to share space with others. \\r\\nBe sure to pay attention to the detail that you can park behind the house. Otherwise, parking is scarce.  Chris was there when we arrived and went over everything we needed to know about the house. It was absolutely perfect other than the fact that we were so busy with our event that we weren\\'t able to spend more time there. This property is one that I highly recommend!! Ballard Bunkhouse was a nice place to stay for our group of 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe appreciated Chris\\'s thoughtful and well placed notes and instructions; and his timely and welcoming e-mails.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unit makes maximum use of its modest size with comfortable queen beds, luxury bedding, a beautiful leather sectional and comfortable pull-out sleeper in the living room.  The kitchen was well equipped with snacks, breakfast foods, cold drinks, gourmet coffee and condiments.\\r\\n\\r\\n2 off street parking spots in back were nice in this parked-up neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was not really enough room for a comfortable sit down meal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, a nice mix of comfortable and funky.  We would stay there again, especially since our friends live only a few blocks away. Loved staying here! Great location and convenient off street parking. Lots of space and easy walk to coffee shops and nightlife, would certainly stay here again.    Fantastic stay. Really communicative. Highly recommended Chris made us feel very welcome in this great heritage home. He set up it just to suit our needs and the place worked out perfectly.\\r\\nHighly recommend. Chris\\'s place was perfect for our trip. Walk to Ballard, close to downtown...it was great! Felt instantly welcomed with little snacks on the counter, and a comfy house. Way to go Chris. Appreciate the hospitality.  We had a great time at the bunkhouse - everything was perfect & comfortable! We especially loved the neighborhood, the stocked cabinets (for a late night snack) & the amazing linens. Thanks Chris for accommodating us last minute!  We booked at the last minute (day of!), and the house was ready for us on short notice with a stocked pantry, cold beverages, and a welcome note! Very clean, nice kitchen, appreciated the wifi and multiple televisions. Nice quiet neighborhood near the heart of Ballard. We were glad for the alley parking as street parking was hard to come by. Everything as described.   Chris was greatt We felt very welcome at the house. Chris was there when we arrived and gave us a brief overview of the house. The neighborhood was a perfect home base for our Seattle weekend. The house is located very close to the Ballard area bars, restaurants and breweries. The kitchen is pretty well equipped and stocked with some snacks and quick meal supplies. A great place to stay if you are looking to see Seattle. Chris made all of us feel so welcome.   The neighborhood was perfectly quiet, charming, and yet still so close to all the downtown Ballard energy at the same time.  With two bedrooms, a perfectly ample kitchen, and a comfortable seating area, it was so well suited to our needs.  Lots of personal touches... a return visit is definitely in order!      Chris was a stellar host, very helpful with my questions, and extremely responsive with communication. Thank you! Chris is a wonderful host - very engaged and responsive.  We were \"greeted\" with chocolate, flowers and a welcome note.  And were encouraged to reach out to him at any time with questions and/or concerns.  The home is in a nice and quiet neighborhood, walking distance to restaurants and shops in Ballard. The home is older but  charming with some nice upgrades. It was clean and welcoming. We appreciated the off street parking spot in the back.   The house was excellent!  Chris left some chocolate and a card on the counter, which was a nice touch, and plenty of water and soda in the fridge.  The instant booking was great, he responded right after booking and everything went as smooth as possible.  A word about the parking in the back, I was driving a full size suv, and the spot didn\\'t look big enough to accommodate it without blocking the alley.  Luckily I found street parking right next to the house.  All in all a great experience! We had such a great time at the Ballard Bunkhouse! Chris left us snacks and drinks on check-in and made everything really easy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is great - we were able to walk to food and parks with our two-year-old in tow and really enjoyed wandering around the neighborhood.  We had a great experience at this unit! Everything was easy in terms of accessing the house, all necessary toiletries were available too. House was well kept and clean! Very much appreciated for a great stay! Thank you Chris!! Chris was an amazing host. He went well above and beyond to make us comfortable - he extended his deck, installed a tiny ramp, and took the doors off the bathroom to accommodate my husband who uses a wheelchair. And, he did so voluntarily and with grace. We\\'re truly thankful and impressed. We had a great time at the bunkhouse for a week with our 3 year old son. It\\'s wonderfully located in Ballard. \\r\\nThe house and furnishings are historic and vintage-y. Chris has done a great job of preserving the historic character of the place while still having nice amenities (new fridge, range/oven, TVs, wifi, leather pull-out couch, Keurig) along with the older wooden furniture. We were even able to host some friends for dinner. The kitchen is not a chef\\'s kitchen (BYO olive oil, spices, sharp knives etc.) but he stocked the pantry for us with other goodies (mac n\\'cheese and snacky stuff) and we took full advantage. We had a wonderful time and can\\'t say enough good things about Chris and his cool historic bunkhouse.  The place had a perfect location in Ballard. We particularly enjoyed our easy morning walks to old Ballard for some of the best coffee in Seattle. We did not have a chance to meet Chris (he stopped by but we were not there) but he went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed. The house was very clean and stocked with everything we needed and more.   We had a great weekend in the Ballard Bunkhouse. The home was clean, furnished with unique period pieces, yet had all the amenities we needed (the coffee drinkers esp liked the Keurig). The beds were Very comfortable. The bunkhouse is so convenient to Ballard-we walked to the locks, had a drink and dinner in a cool Thai place on the way back and to the grocery store the next day. I wish we had more time to explore but had a graduation to attend. Chris was very responsive when we thought we had an issue (I was wrong). We would definitely consider the bunkhouse next time we are in Seattle.  This was my first time using Airbnb - Thank you to Chris for allowing us to add to 2 extra people to our original plan of 5 for a total of 7.  The house is good for 4 or 6.  If you have that many it can get tight with all the suitcases.  We took the long side table under the TV and set it up on the back porch for dinner. This gave us the time to just enjoy each others company, have dessert and talk late into the evening.   The neighborhood is quiet but the streets are narrow with people parking on both sides.  Only one car at a time traveling between.  No air conditioning but the fans kept it cool and Chris is putting in AC soon.  There is parking in the back to avoid the stairs in the front, this was good for us because 1 person in our party couldn\\'t climb stairs.  The house built in 1901 is a work in progress.  I would like to see it when everything is finished. Chris was an awesome host! Very friendly, helpful and humorous.  There were snacks and beverages in the kitchen. All beds had freshly washed linens and were very comfy. The place easily accommodated our group of 5 and was a quick 10 minute drive to downtown. The Ballard neighbourhood was also a fun place to hangout!  It was a very comfortable and homey place to stay with all the amenities you could possibly need. Thanks for the wonderful visit! The Ballard bunkhouse is in a wonderful part of Seattle. So many options in the neighborhood. Chris is extremely accommodating and hospitable!  The pantry and fridge were stocked and he left a very nice welcome letter! The place itself is very comfortable. Well done Chris! We enjoyed our stay at the Ballard Bunkhouse.  Chris has furnished the interior with a mix of period and modern items to achieve a balance between the building\\'s historical character and comfort.  He went to great lengths make us feel welcome.  We arrived early and he showed us around before the official check-in (we then went to Golden Shores park until the house was ready for us).  He left a range of drinks and snacks (including chocolate!) and other packaged food items in case the need arose.  We made good use of the outdoor seating area and new deck, which will be even better when fully finished.  There is some sound transference from the upper level guest accommodations, which usually wasn\\'t much of an issue.  The house is conveniently located a short walk from the Ballard restaurant district, and we enjoyed trying some of them and checking out the nearby botanical garden, locks, and fish ladder.  Great location for exploring a new area of Seattle we hadn\\'t seen before.  The allocated parking is very helpful. Chris took very good care of us. His home is in a beautiful neighborhood.  It started out great, but I would never stay here again. Cute and in a great location. Good communication leading up to reservation and Chris even has snacks out for guests. He also allowed us to check out at noon instead of 10am, which was nice. The space accommodated two couples perfectly. I had friends in from out of town to celebrate in the city for my 40th birthday. We hung out on the porch for about a half hour before leaving for the night. Chris stopped by and chatted with us, mentioning that he had been working on the shower and the bathroom had flooded earlier in the day (we didn\\'t think anything of that at the time). We returned at around 1am, and my husband and I fell asleep right away in the larger bedroom. My friends, however, had an awful experience. When they went to go to bed, there was a very strong odor and they finally figured out that it was coming from the rug under the bed and dresser. Part of it was soaking wet, and had a very strong smell of dog urine. They had to lift the bed and dresser to get the rug out, and they said it was really gross. It had soaked through to the hardwood floor, so the room still smelled really bad even after they put the rug outside. My friends did not sleep well at all. Even with the window and door open, they had to sleep with the covers over their face. Chris definitely said to contact him day or night with any concerns. Unfortunately, I was the one who had his contact info since I handled the rental, and this birthday girl was already out for the night. I felt terribly when I woke up the next morning and heard what had happened, especially since this was our first airbnb experience, and it was my idea. I could definitely still smell the odor, and it was bad. Things happen though, and none of us were upset with Chris at that point. It seemed pretty obvious that the bathroom flood had leaked into the bedroom (attached to the bathroom) and released previous dog urine stains from prior renters. I\\'m sure the hot weather didn\\'t help. What was really disappointing was Chris\\'s response. We asked for a credit and Chris declined. He felt that we were in the wrong for not contacting him in the middle of the night, and noted that there was a couch that could have been used. He also suggested that maybe we had actually stepped in dog poop and that was the issue. That was pretty shocking after what we had described to him, and was honestly offensive. His parting words to me were, \"At the end of the stay when you\\'ve already asked for a late checkout to ask for a credit after you\\'ve eaten the steak is the wrong time to send it back.\"  Our stay in Ballard was exactly what we were looking for. The location was perfect - quiet and safe but easy walk to the action. Chris was a communicative and welcoming host. We had space to entertain for a few friends and had restful sleep. We\\'d definitely stay here again when in the NW!\\r\\n Easily the most welcome we have ever felt while traveling. Chris makes you feel at home and provides plenty of amenities which are great for making the transition smooth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWonderful space and would definitely book again! A fun place with a mix of modern updates and old character. Our group of 6 was quite comfortable throughout. The 1.5 bathrooms were great for larger groups. The fridge was stocked with beverages, and there is a crackers/granola plate as well that was very handy for our groups early morning travel plans. The parking spot in the back made me feel at ease with my rental car. The place was very clean when we arrived and Chris left some very useful information near the kitchen. If you want to explore the neighborhood of Ballard with your friends this is a fantastic accommodation to do just that. Highly recommended. Staying at Chris\\'s home in Ballard was a wonderful first introduction to Airbnb. Chris and his partner were thoughtful and gracious hosts. We came with two small children and they worked hard to accommodate our needs. We had a great time! The home is older but in a great neighborhood within comfortable walking distance of lots of shopping and eating. 15 minutes from downtowns Seattle as well. If we come back, we are staying here again! We had an amazing time at the Ballard Bunkhouse.  We traveled with our two kids and my mother for the weekend in Ballard.  Chris was there to greet us and made extra space for us to park our two cars.  The condo was very clean, had all the extras you could want with comfortable beds.  Loved how close it was to all the fun stuff in Ballard.  Once we parked the car we walked everywhere we wanted to go for the weekend.   We will be back! Chris was easy to communicate with and made us feel welcome.  He left snacks and goodies to eat in the kitchen, which was well stocked.  The house worked out perfect for our family.  We loved the location because you could walk in to town.  Chris is amazing! My husband and I were on a last minute road trip to Vancouver and didn\\'t know when we would be staying in Seattle. It was not till the day of that my husband started looking. Within minutes Chris responded to our booking letting us know how excited he was for our visit. We met with him briefly when we arrived and it was immediately apparent Chris is just one of those people with an warm personality and big heart. The place was exactly as shown. What really set this place apart from other stays were all the little touches around the home that make you feel welcome. There were plenty of linens to use for that HUGE tub! And he left a bowl of snacks and candies that made us feel special, and cold bottled water in the fridge. After nearly 1,000 miles of driving, arriving at Ballard Bunkhouse was the first time we felt at ease and ready to relax.   Really laid back and easy. A bit noisy with the upstairs neighbors but otherwise super wonderful experience. We were welcome by a charming note and chocolates - great touch! Also, plenty of snacks and a yard for our pups.  No complaints here. Chris was a great host! I needed a place for family and friends to stay for my brother\\'s wedding, so we rented the whole house. Chris was flexible on the checkout time since no one had booked the previous night, which helped out. When we arrived, the house was clean and he had laid out some packs of cookies and peppermint patties, which were all eaten promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nChris even helped with a mid-trip request that he clean our sheets and towels because some of the guests were leaving after the first night and being replaced by a new group, and I wasn\\'t going to be around to do it myself. He took care of it for us, which really makes a difference on a short trip when you\\'re trying to maximize your time with friends and family.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall great experience. I\\'d definitely stay here again! 虽然这次入住没有见到Chris，但他准备了亲手撰写的欢迎卡片，并热心答复我相关咨询。房屋是始建于20世纪初的独栋建筑，并准备了丰富的饮料、调味品和厨房用品。我们在此享用了一顿丰盛的早餐。非常难忘的一次入住体验！ Charming place in a great neighborhood. Lives up to the description.  The location was fantastic. Convenient, and a great neighborhood. Bunkhouse was clean, comfortable, and really lovely. The host was quick to get back to us when we had questions. It was a quick trip, but everything was really great.  Even better than the pictures, if you could imagine that! Large, lit home that maintains a warmth and coziness while still giving a luxurious better-than-5-star experience. We felt very comfortable and welcome during our stay. The Bunkhouse is in a fantastic neighborhood, only a couple blocks from great restaurants, cafes and sunset views. My only regret is that we didn\\'t stay here during the whole trip to Seattle! Highly recommend.  This is a great place to stay - very accommodating host, the apartment is exactly as it appears in pictures, and a great price.  Chris also goes out of his way to provide snacks, drinks, and recommendations for places to visit in the neighborhood. The house was very nice and filled with goodies and snacks. The only downside n my opinion was the fact the knives were not very sharp so it made cooking kinda difficult. Chris was an amazing host from the moment we booked our stay through to our departure! His replies were impressively fast, he went above and beyond to accommodate us 6 girls and our requests, had a greeting card and some chocolate waiting for our arrival and even though he was sick, he still kept in touch with us and was accessible day and night for any concerns we may have had. We were all VERY impressed! All of us would highly recommend this cute bunkhouse as it has a little bit of everything for everyone. It\\'s close to down town Seattle, yet it\\'s located on a nice quiet street. There are two bathrooms, the kitchen is spacious, there are lots of ways to adjust the temperature and customize the surroundings to your liking, the desk is a nice place to sit and relax and there was parking available and the check-in/check-put process was smooth and easy! Chris was very kind and had a great sense of humour. We arrived a little early and he was doing a little maintenance work, but still welcomed us in the house giving us a chance to ask questions about the area. And what a great location for a house, a short and lovely walk to the best shops, restaurants, and pubs on Market and Ballard. The bunkhouse has plenty of space, lots of seating, a great kitchen, and good parking for my full size truck in the back. The house was clean and comfortable, and since it over a 100 years old, there is the odd spot that has a rattle or loose floorboard, but that is more charming than anything! Thanks for the great stay Chris! Only a one night stay as we were transiting home from a college tour but comfortable sleep after 2week road trip.\\r\\nThanks for the easy stay. Chris was a great host. The house is super cute and we had everything we needed. We were in town for a wedding and wanted to have the family over Sunday morning for a brunch. Chris was very accommodating and helpful. It was nice to have 2 toilets, a full kitchen and outdoor patio. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in town! Chris was so accommodating and wonderful to work with when planning our stay. The house is a great space and in a wonderful location.  This experience was PERFECT! Chris was an excellent host; his home is clean, quaint, cute, comfortable and convenient. I had no trouble finding the location and the free parking in the back was awesome. The fridge had drinks and the coffee was fully stocked. what more could you need? the beds were super comfortable and soft. the best part about this listing is the bath tub. jacuzzi jets and big enough for two; the best way to end a night out exploring Ballard! I highly recommend this listing to everyone and anyone. I\\'ll be using this home to house my family in the future for sure!  Great location. Chris was very kind and was very communicative before and during our stay. We enjoyed our time at the bunkhouse.  The place was great. Exactly as described and walking distance from all kinds of great stuff in Ballard. Everything was clean and comfortable. Just what we needed. We had a great time at this historic house! Cozy, traditional feel. Nothing fancy, but the house was in a great part of the city near great restaurants and cafe\\'s. Chris was super helpful the whole time.  Chris did a wonderful job of making us feel welcome. He made sure we were very informed on arrangements before arrival, making everything very simple and seamless. Upon arrival the bunkhouse was clean, well-appointed and welcoming. It had everything we could have needed. We were greeted with a note of welcome and some chocolate--which made our arrival all that much sweeter. We loved the bath in particular!  When we left, Chris found something we had left behind and has been kind enough to arrange its return--going well above and beyond the call of duty! The Ballard Bunkhouse is an awesome spot. The host, Chris, is incredible and with unparalleled hospitality. We asked for some suggestions upon arrival, things to do and places to eat, and Chris delivered. The suggestions, albeit strange, were perfect and we had a blast.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay and extend many thanks to Chris. I highly recommend the Ballard Bunkhouse.  Exactly as described, easy to get in and spacious. Ballard Bunkhouse was awesome, Chris is a terrific host.   Great upfront directions, had everything we needed and more.  Textbook how to exceed expectations, thank you Chris!\\r\\n\\r\\nDave Krick The house was perfect for 5 people. The place itself has lots of charm and a nice area to sit out back. All the extras we needed during our stay (towels, pillows, hair dryer, etc) were easily accessible. We were also able to push the checkout time back a hour or so which was much needed!  Chris was wonderful via message prior to arrival, accommodating and gracious. The space itself was clean, inviting and comfortable. My friends and I loved staying here. The snacks, drinks and thoughtful touches made us feel at home and welcomed. :) We had a great stay. The house was charming and comfortable. The location was perfect, an easy walk to downtown Ballard. \\r\\nChris was great to work with and gladly accommodated our request for a later check out. The personalized note and snacks were a nice touch. Chris goes out of his way to make sure that all who stay enjoy themselves and want to come back. Logement bien placé dans un quartier agréable. Love this place! It was easy and perfect. And it\\'s has some history to it that is really cool.  Chris was a great host! Prompt at responding and very thoughtful (he remembered I was bringing my newborn and left a crib for her).  He provided great coffee, snacks and drinks which were refilled each day.  The place was clean, had comfortable beds and best of all in a charming, walkable location in Ballard.   Great Place and he even had a Toblerone! My favorite chocolate. Keep it up Chris. Great getaway and close to historic Ballard. Our stay at the Bunkhouse was perfect. The house is beautiful and has been lovingly restored. We felt extremely welcome and the house is well stocked with supplies and local information. The location is excellent, you can walk around Ballard and there are great local cafes and breweries. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom is fantastic, plan some time for a bath!   Cute little place.  We had a wonderful time.  Kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms are all fully stocked.  Great find. Great location, close to Capitol Hill, and great restaurants. House was very upscale but with lots of unique charm. I loved the bathroom (the jetted tub and massaging shower head) and the deck were especially nice. The house was roomy and perfect for our group. Chris left us coffee and chocolate which was really thoughtful. Construction next door woke us up early but that will probably be finished soon. This is our second visit—a group of friends in Seattle for an event. We chose to go back here because: the space and location are perfect for us, the host is accommodating and responsive, there’s easy parking and ground-level entry, it’s warm and comfortable, there’s a full kitchen (a must), the 1.5 bathrooms make it possible to function as a group, and overall, our collective experience was great the first time, and great the second time. Thanks Chris!  Chris house was a beautiful quiet place exactly what we needed after a gig. Had condiments and a great note to go along with it welcoming us. 5 out of 5! This place was as advertised and even more! This lovely home had every amenity we needed with plenty of space for our family of four. It felt luxurious to have this whole home to go to in the wonderful and historic neighborhood of Ballard in Seattle. The Toblerone and hand written card were an amazing touch! Our favorite part was the extremely well written booklet with the history of the home and the Ballard neighborhood. It\\'s a short walk from tons of fun restaurants, bars, and (my personal favorite) Sonic Boom Records in Ballard. It\\'s also an easy drive into the city to see all of the classic Seattle tourist spots. No hotel could match the coziness, comfort, and convenience of this wonderful home.  The host made me feel very welcome. There were notes explaining everything and snacks. Very comfortable and very friendly. Would highly recommend! Ballard Bunkhouse suited our group great! Great location for what we had planned! Absolutely clean and cozy. Such a great warm place. Thank you for the great manual and labels on things. First experience with Airbnb and will try it again! The note flowers and chocolate was enjoyed by all! The house was in a perfect location and had that old house charm, giving it the perfect home away from home feel. The side yard was perfect for our lil\\' pup Peanut Butter to make quick trips out. We had a great stay in Ballard and enjoyed exploring such a fun neighborhood. Chris was an excellent host and provided very prompt communication for all of our needs.  Chris was very attentive. The house was warm, clean and comfortable. I would stay there again.  This was my third time staying at the Bunkhouse - again, it was excellent! The house is very comfortable, well decorated, and conveniently located. The new heaters kept the house nice and cozy, and as usual, I loved the comfortable beds, huge bathtub, and fluffy linens. The nice huge couch in the living room is a great addition, as is the deck in the back patio. Chris had the place stocked with snacks, cereal, bottled water, and coffee. This place is also very conveniently located - 5 minute walk to downtown Ballard for restaurants and nightlife, and about a 20 minute drive to where I work downtown. I will be back for a fourth stay! Great host and very accommodating! The place is very nice and in great location if you want to be in Ballard.  The house has a very warm and laid back feeling.  The half bath made it extra accommodating for (2) adults and (2) teenagers.  Off-street parking was a bonus.  Chris made it very easy to stay.  The security code grants entry without a complicated system.  There were helpful notes left where function was not intuitive. Chris was an awesome host, more then helpful! Place was great amazing 1901 house with modern amenities! Would stay again Chris was a great host! He always responded quickly and allowed us to check in early since we caught an early flight and needed a place to drop off our bags. The house was very clean and had all the amenities that we needed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Chris! Chris is a wonderful host!  The lower bunk was so clean, warm, and inviting!  The extra touches of fully stocked snacks and refreshments truly made me feel welcome and at home.  The linens were fresh and clean and the pillows were my favorite: memory foam!  The extra large tub was a real treat, too!  Super close to my family and Ballard.  Can\\'t wait to stay again! Chris stopped by at our arrival and answered some questions we had about the property. He also left a basket full of snacks for us which we thought was really nice.  Chris\\'s Bunkhouse was adorable. It was exactly as described! My family particularly liked that the house was decorated tastefully for the holidays and that there were coffee and snacks provided :) Thanks for helping to make my family\\'s trip to Seattle a success!! We had a lovely stay at the Bunkhouse - it was easy to find and access. We appreciated the snacks after a long day! The beds were super comfy, the place was really clean and cozy. We loved the blend of modern facilities in a heritage house, a great unique stay. I would definitely stay here again! Thanks Chris! We had a great stay at the Ballard Bunkhouse. A great location near downtown with parks and other amenities within walking distance. The house had everything we needed and more! The bunkhouse made our Seattle experience unforgettable. This place is great. Chris has been doing this for a while and it shows. Last-minute reservation to check in in no time, everything was clean, the place was nice and warm, and it was all very luxurious. Highly recommended! What a perfect place to stay the night! This charming, historic house is exactly as it\\'s pictured. We stayed in Seattle for New Years Eve and all of the beds were comfy with lots of extra blankets, and Chris encourages you to \"crank the heat\" since the house is 115 years old!\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch lovely welcoming touches like a handwritten card, snacks on the counter and water and soda in the fridge. My hungover friends savored that Sprite the next morning, let me tell you.\\r\\n\\r\\nChris was very easy to communicate with, and the house is only blocks from the D-line bus that is a straight shot into downtown. Short walk to all of the great food and coffee Ballard has to offer--this place is a perfect location to be steeped in Ballard awesomeness while having easy access to other parts of the city. Had a wonderful time staying at Michaels place in a neighborhood that proved to be easily walkable and extremely enjoyable. Mike\\'s apartment was as listed, great space for family and friends to gather for dinner and enjoy the holidays together. Easily slept 5, was very close to tons of great night life in ballard and had great transit to downtown seattle via uber and the nearby bus lines. Buying groceries from the markets was great for when we felt like staying in and watching football. A great space and a great neighborhood. Mike was easy to work with and readily acceptable.  We had a fabulous time staying at Mike\\'s house in Seattle! The house is very conveniently located in Ballard, and is a short walk to many great restaurants and bars. It is also very close to the supermarket. When we arrived, Mike gave us great suggestions about what to do and see during our time in Seattle. Overall, the house was very clean, and was great for two couples. The kitchen was well equipped, and the living room was a comfortable place for us to hang out when we wanted to relax. The fireplace made the house especially cozy. Mike was flexible with our arrival and departure times, and he was easy to get in touch with. We would definitely stay there again! The place was great and easy hassle free checking in. They had great amenities and the house was in a great location. Nice quiet neighborhood.  Mike communicates well in getting check-in instructions, and house instructions.  The Foodie paradise is as described--clean and fresh.   \\r\\n\\r\\nParking can be a challenge in this neighborhood.  Plan for the possibility of needing to park more than a block away.  The house was great.  Great location.  The facilities the kitchen are all top class.  We had a great trip. Mike was easy to communicate with and his home is lovely and very comfortable. We slept well and enjoyed the coffee he left for us. We enjoyed the fire pit and he was more than gracious with me and my mistake with it. It is not an edge burning one like I thought it was. Although parking is \"ample\" it is not always available close by. The home is close to shops and dining. We did more than our fare share of walking - loved Pike Place and enjoyed our stop at Number 6 Cider on our way back! I need to note that for those guests who are not used to being near a large city, there is a small group of homeless people that congregate a couple of blocks away. They were very quiet and neat and did not cause us concern. My son and I were exploring cities for him post-graduation. Seattle came out on top, so I may be staying here again when my husband and I come out to visit him.  This was a perfect place for my family to stay during my wedding in Seattle. Everything was as described, and conveniently located. Would definitely stay here again.  Great home - beautiful and just as pictures show, in a nice neighborhood in NW Seattle with lots to do nearby. Michael made communicating before and after the trip simple and easy. Would highly recommend!  Foodie Paradise was all it was described to be.  We two couples found there was plenty of space for relaxing when we were done for the day and the bedrooms and baths were comfortable and clean.  The kitchen was well stocked with all utensils and condiments needed for our occasional meals eaten at home.  The fireplace was wonderful when it grew cool.  We enjoyed the patio during all hours and the fire pit set the mood on a cool evening.  The neighborhood is very walkable, with numerous restaurants and pubs nearby.  The Ballard Farmer\\'s Market was a must visit.  Parking can be a challenge, but we managed to park right at the location or a block away at the most.  It is suggested that Uber or public transportation be utilized if going downtown.  Our host was gracious and prompt in communicating when I had any questions. Tue house si really lovely. Clean and noiseless. Also the area si cool. A bit far frombola downtown but surely charming (and there are many bus very near). It si a great choice! Michael\\'s house was immaculate and comfortable. It felt very private, but was in close proximity to numerous restaurants, shops and coffee houses. We were able to take a shuttle from the airport to this location and walk everywhere we wanted to go, which saved us the hassle and expense of a rental car. The neighborhood felt safe and everyone we encountered was extremely friendly. Several times during our stay, Michael made us feel at home by sending us helpful messages. As we have family in the area and plan to visit frequently, we will wholeheartedly recommend this house to our family and would love to stay there again in the future. This house was absolutely beautiful and felt extremely comfortable and clean for our stay. It\\'s a little further from town but we loved exploring the nearby neighborhoods of Ballard and Freemont. It\\'s about a $14 uber/lyft drive from downtown Seattle/Capitol Hill. We loved the firepit and the outdoor patio. Everything was lovely and would recommend this for a comfortable stay in Seattle!  We loved this place!  We would definitely recommend this host and the accommodations and would stay here again next time we go to Seattle.   The listing was accurate, great place to stay! Very quiet and clean with detailed guide for ammenities in house.  All furnishings and linens were high quality and lots of space indoors and outdoors to relax and entertain. Great neighborhood, accurate info on house and how to make it work best. Beautiful outdoor fire pit. Quiet home. Super clean and organized.  Would rent this place again. \\r\\n Exactly as described - wonderful cottage.  Hosts Mark and Marti went out of their way to make us feel at home. Located in Ballard within walking distance of many restaurants and shops and only a short drive to downtown Seattle.  Great downtown Ballard location. Furnishings are attractive and house is spacious for 2. Added plus is a driveway. No frills but a good stopping place for those on the run.  The cabin was great, and only about 2 blocks from all the rest shopping and food in the Ballard neighborhood. Check in and check out were super easy, and they left maps and notes about the house so we felt right at home. A great experience. A friend and I booked this house for a long weekend. It could not have been in a better location. Great local food and beers are within walking distance and the house was perfect fit for a weekend stay. Thanks a ton! Great location! So many restaurants and shops within walking distance. Also very easy to drive into downtown, everything we wanted to see/do was close by. The house was exactly as described, simple accommodations, but  comfortable. Mark and Marti were easy to get in contact with and very helpful.  Delightful! It is exactly as Mark and Marti describe...a little worn on the outside but warm, welcoming ( instantly felt at home) on the inside. LOVED the location - walking distance to amazing coffee shops, dining spots, parks, a library, the water.  Easy access to downtown Seaatle and other neighborhoods in Seattle. I\\'d live here forever if I could!\\nThe space inside the was awesome - loved not being linked to technology (currently no wifi - they do plan to offer that soon though) and the visual stimulation/distraction of a TV ( currently no TV - they do plan to install one though). The beds were great. Layout of the home was spacious. Didn\\'t take advantage of the backyard but would have had we been there a day longer!\\nThe only bummer was the wash machine had broken earlier in the week and leaked onto the old floor causing a musty smell that permeated the home but was resolved when the doors were open. Also Marti was awesome and stopped by to give my friend and I $ so we could do laundry at a laundromat close to the home...she even checked out which laundromat would be the best for us and had good Yelp ratings. Above and beyond is what I would say about these hosts! Looking forward to coming back and staying again! Mark & Marti have a great little house in the heart of Ballard steps from all the nightlife, restaurants, and weekend farmers market. The house has all the amenities (no internet) that you need for a great stay. Never met the hosts but they were quick to respond to email and check in was a breeze. Cool little backyard was another plus. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Mark & Marti\\'s cottage is fabulous. Great location in Ballard, right by the bus line, good restaurants, and BREWERIES. The apartment is very clean and organized, with everything necessary for a comfortable visit. I would definitely stay here again.  We had a great time -the cottage was perfect for our family of 3 and the location is great, only a block away from all the fun Ballard has to offer. Thank you! Mark and Marti had an incredibly clean and comfortable space set up for us upon arrival. It was a great place to stay, within walking distance of several cool places in the Ballard area. We would highly recommend this place to any AirBnB guest! We had a great stay here! There is a splash pad down the road so my toddler had a blast! The beds were very comfortable! The backyard it was relaxing sitting at the patio table! Marti and Mark were very helpful!  The cottage is modest and simple but such a perfect location to experience the Ballard scene. My sisters and I slept like babies in this quiet, comfy spot. Thank you! My parents stayed at this cottage so that they could attend my wedding locally.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cottage was spacious, clean, and had everything my parents could have needed. The location is perfect-just a couple of blocks from Ballard downtown. Mark and Marti were very communicative throughout the process. I highly recommend staying here if you get the chance! The cottage was not as attractive as the photos and description.  It was very clean and is cute.  However, it is in serious need of many repairs.   With some sprucing up and maintenance it would be a much nicer rental.   Windows did not open and front and back door let in all the bugs when open.   The neighborhood was disappointing and somewhat dumpy.   Great experience, highly recommended The listing was accurate, the location was great!  We could have done a lot more in the house but we spent a lot of time exploring Seattle.   We loved our stay in this rustic cottage right in Ballard. It sure is a gem in the midst of all the modern apartments going up all around! Our expectations about the house were right on, since it is well advertised that it is an old house, clean on the inside and a little crusty on the outside. It served us well as a place to sleep at night and take some rest during the day, while being right in the heart of town. Mark checked in with us often to make sure we were set up and had all we need. The only thing we had to do to prepare the house for our 1 year old explorer was to move some items up and put in outlet protectors. Simple, cozy, cabin like feel. Reminded me of going to my grandma\\'s lake house. The cottage was clean, with everything we needed. The location is very central in Ballard, close to restaurants, coffee shops, bars, boutiques, and a great farmers\\' market. We had a good time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs honestly stated in the property description, the cottage looks run-down from the outside, although it is very charming on the inside. A bit of yard work and a coat of paint would help a lot to improved the curb appeal and perhaps discourage some of the homeless that congregate in this area.  We had a great stay at the cottage - we had everything we needed and mark and Marti were very helpful and resourceful - we would stay there again for sure ... Mark and Marti were warm and welcoming hosts, making sure we had everything we needed; they also had the initiative to call and confirm our plans which was much appreciated.  Planning a holiday for family takes quite a bit of work and i was happy that staying at Mark\\'s house, his attentiveness really took a load off my mind.  The interior of the house is, as mentioned, very well kept and clean - it is also very functional and the kitchen utensils are modern and new.  We had a great time at the place, and thank Mark for hosting us! Mark and Marti were great, responsive, nice. The place was in a fantastic location, and very well-maintained. We didn\\'t see an ironing board (we were here for a wedding), asked them about it, and they dropped an iron and an ironing board off same-day. It would have still been a great stay even if they hadn\\'t been able to do that, but it just speaks to the kind of nice and helpful people they are. Other than that, the place was exactly what we were looking for: a great and comfortable base of operations in a great location/neighborhood. We\\'d stay here again for sure. We had a great time in Seattle and the house in Ballard was in a wonderful location with lots of brilliant restaurants, bars and shops. The house had plenty of space for our party of three and we were very comfortable during our stay. We had a great long weekend in the Ballard. Great location.   Plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, etc. within just a few blocks.  Nearby grocery store and well equipped kitchen made cooking easy.  Everything very clean.  We traveled with our toddler and the 2nd small bedroom was great for him.  There is a small playground in the neighborhood.   The bathroom is quite small but functional and clean.  We\\'d definitely stay again. Mark and Marti provided all of the necessary information for an easy check-in. Although they weren\\'t onsite, we had everything we needed for the stay. The house had a lot of charm and was clean. The biggest appeal was it\\'s proximity to Old Town Ballard (2 blocks), which was great for exploring.  We showed up a little early which was our bad - been on the road for 3 weeks now so our timing is off. The house is super cool and in a perfect location. It\\'s got everything you need and the hosts were quick to respond and didn\\'t bother us at all once we were in the home. I loved Seattle and the neighborhood. So great.  Great hosts! Very quick and thorough communication. Set us up perfectly for our stay. Their small, quaint cottage was perfect for our needs and made our stay in Seattle feel a bit more authentic. Ballard is a beautiful little area not too far from downtown destinations. Two places in that area we really enjoyed were Caffe Fiore and Morsel (insane biscuits). All around, we were very pleased with our stay! Mark and Marti\\'s cottage was perfect for our 3 night stay in Seattle.  The space was exactly as described and everything was set up for our arrival.  The cottage is well furnished and very comfortable.  The location is the perfect place to stay and enjoy all that Seattle has to offer without being in the hustle of downtown.  There are countless restaurants, coffee shops, and bars within a five minute walk of the cottage.  We loved our time and would be sure to book here again!  Thanks! The house is so comfortable and cute, it is perfect for 2 or 3 people.  The kitchen was outfitted well for cooking.   You could stay here for a long or short term stay.  Described accurately, the hosts are very welcoming.  We appreciated how clean it was.  Would definitely stay here again, it was a great value.    thanks for the smoothe communication! my brother and father enjoyed the house!  This cottage was exactly as described and was perfect for a weekend getaway.  We love Ballard and have never stayed so close to the \"main drag\".  It was wonderful to be able to walk to restaurants, shops, coffeeshops and the Ballard Farmer\\'s Market.   Easy check-in, great location for access to Ballard, Fremont, the Locks,  delicious restaurants and shops. Very spacious and clean inside. Nice cottage with convenience and privacy. The check-in process is absolutely easy. Many restaurants and bars within 2 blocks. Probably the best QFC in 1.5 blocks. Overall a very good choice. We loved our stay at Mark and Marti\\'s cottage! The location was unbeatable, walking distance to restaurants, cafes, shops, and grocery stores. Ballard is an awesome neighborhood. Great communication, quick to respond. Cottage was very clean and comfortable, exactly as described, lots of space and even a little backyard area. Thanks Mark and Marti! Roberta and Dan we\\'re very nice. The cottage was awesome and in great condition. Many windows (and screens to keep the bugs out). The place is very private, quite, and surrounded by trees. You feel like you are at a lake resort but only 10 minutes drive from the hippest of Seattle\\'s neighborhoods. We enjoyed listening to the many ducks and paddle-boating on the lake. However, our canoeing adventure quickly became a swimming adventure. Getting in a canoe is harder than it looks, but at least we have an embarrassing story to tell. Perfect charming cottage in the heart of Ballard. My 4 year old son even loved his room with the bed. Hat tip for the hosts having the place decorated for Halloween too! Everything was well documented and easy.  A great place in a great neighborhood.   The cottage was lovely, and just as described in the listing.  It is quite convenient to all the great stores, coffee houses, etc. in Ballard.  We especially liked having off-street parking.   Great location and good place for the price. The house was a bit musty, but otherwise quite comfortable.  The home was just as described. Very charming and clean just a few minutes walk to the bus stop, grocery store, and restaurants. Mark and Marti were so thoughtful they provided umbrellas, the discount card to the grocery store and growlers so you can fill up at the local brewery. These little details made you feel like you were at home. Would definitely stay again when I return to Seattle. Very nice cottage\\\\and location was ecelent in Ballard The 1919 Cottage offers exactly what it is told to be.  Very cozy and comfy.  One of kind experience.  Great place to stay! Charming and homey. Quiet but still close to the main part if Ballard. A wonderful full kitchen and their awesome comfy couch were highlights. Also they have a driveway for you to park which is really convenient.  We loved this little cottage (one of the last houses on the block not turned into massive, multi-unit condos) and it was perfect for me and my daughter.  Cozy, yet plenty of room.  We appreciated the thoughtful details like umbrellas (which we used!).  We would absolutely want to stay here the next time we visit friends in Ballard!  \"Charming\" is the perfect word to describe this cottage. The common areas were awesome for a home this size. Location was terrific and within walking distance to great shops and restaurants. Marti and Mark supplied all essentials necessary for a comfortable stay and were responsive to all our needs.\\r\\n Staying with Brian and Angela was fantastic, and we were their very first guests! The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the hosts were welcoming, and the location was incredible. Our stay exceeded our expectations and my partner and I would be thrilled to stay with Brian and Angela again if we go back to visit Seattle. Brian and Angela were very nice and hospitable. They made us feel right at home and very welcomed! The room is small but sufficient and the bed was comfy. We had a good stay with them :) Thank you!  Very welcoming and great place to stay. Place was clean and neat; kitchen was made available to us. Hosts gave us great advice on places to try in the area (get pastries at Cafe Bezalu!) I really enjoyed staying in Ballard with Brian and Angela. Ballard is a cool part of town and a good choice if you arrive in Seattle by car because there\\'s lots of free parking by the house. Both Brian and Angela were helpful with suggestions for fun things around town and my friend and I even ended up going to see the same show they went to and had recommended. And it was fantastic! I would definitively recommend staying with them. The rooms are comfortable and we really enjoyed the quirky old house.  We had a great stay with Brian. The house is very comfy, and Brian is a great host. We\\'d definitely stay here again.  After an initial communication breakdown, we had a lovely stay. Comfortable room, Brian and his wife are lovely. Brian was very easy to work with, communicated well, and made accommodations for my late night arrival . Place was comfortable and clean. Acabamos de alojarnos en Plum House, en Seattle y la verdad que todo fue maravillosos, la casa tal cual las fotos, todo impeccable ,la ubicacion perfecta!! La verdad que estamos muy contentos y agradecidos con Mercy!!\\r\\nGracias!! Great 10 nights in Plum House! Nice house design with luxury and comfortable facilities made us totally relaxed and can help loving this fantastic home! The hot tub on the roof is the best way to spend the whole afternoon! The only one thing that I feel regret is that we didn\\'t have chance to cook in the house because of our itinerary, the open kitchen is amazing! We had a wonderful stay at the Plum House.  My husband, 12 year old daughter and I joined my 70+ year old parents, brother and sister-in-law and their 3.5 year old son for a relaxing time in Ballard.  The home is beautiful, spacious, very comfortable and its location is convenient.  There is a grocery store and park within walking distance and the home is equipped with everything we needed for our 4 day stay.  We took in Seattle Reign and Seahawks games and enjoyed the Woodland Park Zoo (less than 10 minutes away), Pikes Place Market and the Museum of Flight.  \"Downtown\" Ballard is within walking distance of the home for fun shopping, great food and entertainment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you Mercy for a wonderful stay.   When we first signed up to stay at Plum House we were a little afraid that the listing might not be as good as advertised. But when we got there, my wife and sons could not have been more pleased or excited about the accommodations. The house is spotless and full of modern character. There is a lovely rooftop deck where you can enjoy a dip in the hot tub or stargaze at night.  We loved picking vegetables from the garden in the back yard. And the Ballard neighborhood has lots of good restaurants and fun nightlife within walking distance.  Mercy sent us a welcome email with some detailed info about the house and the area.  The house is on a quiet block but only a short walk to everything.  There is a supermarket two blocks away and pubs and restaurants are only three blocks.  The house is lovely.  We felt very comfortable.  Plenty of room (there were 7 adults).  House was very clean and beautifully maintained. The Plum house was great. Very well organized and convenient to all of the interesting things in Ballard.  The house is beautiful. Our group of 7 guys stayed 3 nights at Plum House, and could not have been more satisfied!  Mercy was very easy to communicate with pre-trip, and also while we were there. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was in great condition and clean, had a nice contemporary feel, and some really cool green concepts.  There is a perfect mix of common space and private bedrooms.  The kitchen is glorious to cook in and socialize at the same time.  The roof top deck is a great touch for a relaxing view.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was ready with everything we needed, from food and cooking supplies to bedding to cold beer to produce in the garden.  The reference book was carefully prepared and we used it several times. The neighborhood is very quiet, no issues with traffic noise. Groceries, restaurants, breweries, bus line, and car rental are all in walking distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral times our group commented on how the house was way better than the hotel option, and also how Plum House was more than expected from the airbnb listing.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was my first time using airbnb, and I hope every time going forward is this easy and rewarding!  Thank you for opening your home to us!\\r\\n The neighbourhood where the house is located serves perfectly to get to know Seattle and its surroundings without the noisyness and busyness of Seattle. The area is perfect for breakfast and has grocery, bakery and bars all in walking distance. The house was lovely and spacious for a family of 7 accomodating all needs. And to add some loveliness to it, there was a nice garden in the backyard. The home itself is open and inviting, and it was kind of amazing to be in the middle of Ballard for the weekend. A lovely loaf of bread and jam awaited us in the kitchen, which kicked things off nicely. The guest binder was very organized and included far more information than I expected, too. Easy connection to the audio receiver to play music via Bluetooth, ample guest linens, and more. Our group loved staying at the house during our conference and I look forward to staying there again if the opportunity presents itself. Thanks, Mercy! The house was great! We lived the location, it felt like home. This was our first Airbnb experience and we will definitely do it again. Thanks! We decided to rent Plumb house for a designers work offsite... we were looking for a local space that would be condusive to brainstorming/sketching/talking and bonding with our team.  One of our teamates flew in from Lyon,France and two other team members choose to stay on site throughout the week instead of driving back and forth from their homes.  The rest of us lived within short walks and mainly stayed onsite just during the days/evenings.  The house was absolutely perfect!  we were able to do slideshows of our photo research and watch vidoes from the TV in the den.  We spread out across the sofas with all our samples and created elaborate sticky note assemblages on the sliding glass doors!  At the beginning of our stay the host sent someone to check in and fix the levels of the hot tub for us! very nice and we made use of it to unwind after the long days.  This really was a perfect space for our needs and we especially appreciated being such a short walk to cafe Besalu for espresso \\'pick me ups\\' and old ballard for our evening meals.  The space was clean.  incredibly well organized. Very comfortable and nicely designed/laid out.  The kitchen was especially lovely... and definitely inspired words of envy from more than one of our team.  We appreciated having access to such a perfect space and would recommend it highly to any group looking for a place to land in the area.  The only drawback is the high cleaning fee ... makes it worthwhile only if you stay for a longer time frame like we did. Mercy is very nice and supper quick in responding. The house is beautiful with warm wood heated floors. Ballard is one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle with many popular restaurants and shops. I liked the apartment and the location a lot. \\r\\nHowever, we did have some problems during our stay. When we arrived first at night, the entry door key code was wrong so we had to wait for Mercy to respond, when she is in a different time zone. (She told us that her housekeeper forgot the change the code.) Somehow the doors to the terrace cannot be locked and we were not able to access the rooftop deck due to the broken door lock during our stay. Mercy was very nice and apologize to all these but with all the accidents, our stay was not the best or not very pleasant. Also, I was expecting four bedrooms with four beds, but it turns out that I have to switch one of the sofa to bed. It is the first time that I was asked to do a load of laundry (towers or sheets) before I leave when I got charged for $200 cleaning fees. I guess for use, the overall experience is not worth what we paid for. \\r\\nSo if you are looking for a beautiful house and nice area, this is definitely a good choice but just make sure to check if everything is working. The Plum House is a wonderful place to stay. Although there were only six of us, we often entertained twelve extended family members for dinners. The open design with the kitchen, living room and dinning room, create an easy place to host nearby relatives. There are 3 bedrooms and 2 full baths upstairs and a TV room that converts into a 4th bedroom on the main floor with a half-bath. The hot tub on the roof was a welcome addition. There is a deck off the main floor and a nice sitting area on the roof. It would be a great place to stay in the summer, where one could take full advantage of the deck and roof. In summary, this is a great place to stay in Seattle, and wonderful for large gatherings. Only caveat, we did wake up every weekday morning at 7am to construction noise across the street. This also created congestion for street parking. I suspect this will be done by spring. My stay at Brad and Liz\\'s was exactly what I was looking for. Both Brad and Liz were very friendly and welcoming. The space was very comfortable with a cozy bed with nice linen, a small table and kitchenette and even a couch. It was all very comfortable. I only wish I had more time to enjoy the lovely gardens out back!  My girlfriend and I stayed 3 nights in Brad & Liz\\'s new basement studio and had all the space and accommodations we needed throughout. There is super easy access to food and transit. I don\\'t want to suggest this space was only adequate - If you grant Airbnb the status of being a radical, modern way of redistributing human access to resources, Brad & Liz are at the top of that evolutionary food chain. If their availability calendar ever overlaps with the need for a place to stay in Seattle, don\\'t hesitate. Love the convenient location to Ballard/Freemont and more.  Both Brad & Liz made us feel very comfortable, as if we were good friends!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actual basement \"apt.\" was very clean, tidy & updated decor`.  The use of the garden area was a special treat as the weather was fabulous!  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will be back Brad & Liz!   We did not meet Brad and Liz as they were out of town. They made arrangements though for a friend to welcome us and be available during our stay. The one thing I would add to the current listing is that the entry to the basement guest room is down a steep set of stairs that would be difficult for anyone having mobility issues. Brad and Liz\\'s place was great! The location is beautiful and right by some very cool places to visit. I definitely recommend the Ballard Locks and the Ballard Sunday Farmer\\'s Market. The basement \"apt\" had everything we needed. Access to a fridge and microwave is so helpful. And the gardens are lovely! We knew we were in good hands! Great place to stay!  Although our hosts were out of town, it was no problem getting in and around.  Had several options left in case we did need anything.  Great room with everything we needed, great location near to transit.  Well-maintained home and beautiful yard!   Brad and Liz were amazing Airbnb hosts.  They are very knowledgeable and friendly -- we loved chatting with them when running into each other.  They know the area very well and are wonderful people all-around.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir house in Ballard was warm, welcoming, and felt just like home -- the basement room (which did not at all feel like a basement) was nice and cold during the recent heat wave.  They provided everything we could have possibly needed and then some. The bed was super comfortable and the kitchenette/dining area was extremely convenient. (Oh, and they have the two sweetest kitties hanging around the yard!)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is safe and interesting, too -- we loved it.  There\\'s lots of cute shops and restaurants/bars nearby, as well as a variety of more nature-y things to do (Ballard Locks, Golden Gardens, etc).  We miss Ballard already! Liz and Brad welcomed us by chatting and explaining all about the place where we would call home for the next five days.  The apartment was clean, comfortable and more than adequate for our home away from home.  Even the coffee was good (good coffee with a french press maker) and we are picky!  The sitting are in the back yard is beautiful, whimsical, full of all kinds of flowers.  Brad and Liz are always busy working on something creative and industrious.  We really liked staying here for five days.  It was great place to spring from.  The neighborhood is fun too with lots going on and great eating places. Absolutely wonderful space to stay in! Location was perfect, an easy walk to many nice cafes including Cafe Besalu. Sheets on the bed are super soft. Kitchenette has all the necessities: cups, flatware, cutting board, teapot, electric kettle, and mini fridge. Brad and Liz are excellent hosts, we felt very welcome. They gave us great recommendations for new places to check out in Ballard. It was very easy to access public transportation from this location too when we needed to head downtown or catch the bus up to Mount Vernon. We will definitely miss Jasper the cat and the lovely garden.  Listing description is accurate. We were very comfortable and Brad and Liz live in a great neighborhood -- in a quiet are that is walking distance to the main commercial strip and the Locks. Brad contacted us before check in to make sure everything was good and to make sure that they would be around when we were expecting to arrive.  Brad and Liz seemed eager to meet us, and Liz showed us all around the beautiful garden and our room.  While she showed us around she was giving us lots of great information of Seattle and Ballard, while answering any question only a local would know.  The home has lots of great character and we even got to try our first fig from their tree.  It was truly a pleasure to stay on their property.   Brad & Liz are wonderful easygoing and interesting hosts. Their home including the place you\\'ll be staying is very comfortable and clean. The area of Ballard is gorgeous and it\\'s an easy public transport connection to Downtown. Stay here, and like me, you will fall in love with Seattle Very kind and helpful couple. Great and very comfortable space in a beautiful house and garden.   Great Neighborhood too. Would love to be back there. Liz and Brad are just great hosts, and provided a welcoming atmosphere the moment we arrived for our week long stay.  The two resident cats, Jasper and Lily, are just so sweet and friendly. This was our first experience with Airbnb, and we couldn\\'t be happier.  We walked through a delightful rose garden full of colorful flowering plants as we walked to and from our entrance, and this provided such a good atmosphere. \\r\\n\\r\\n The quiet  location was perfect as  it was an easy walk to the Chittenden Locks, and picturesque downtown Ballard with all the great eating places and Farmer\\'s Market on Sunday. Golden Gardens Beach is a short drive with a great walking trail. We took the #40 bus to downtown Seattle, so it was very convenient  for many reasons including ample parking.\\r\\n\\r\\n The bed was very comfortable with soft sheets.  In fact, I\\'m missing the bed!!!   The kitchenette had beautiful new cabinets, and the entire space is very light and airy due to large windows even though it is in the basement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, it was fun to spend a little time at the hosts\\' joint birthday party in the rose garden with their delightful friends. It was a good feeling to be included.   I am missing the Seattle area, and look forward to a return trip one day, and a chance to enjoy the Victorian home once more. That was a great first stay at an airbnb. Brad and Liz accommodated our late arrival time with no difficulty, the place was just as advertised, and we had plenty of space. The bed was comfy- super soft sheets! We had a chance to visit with our hosts and they are fantastic people. I would absolutely stay here again. I\\'m allergic to cats (they have cats in the house) so I discussed that with Brad beforehand. He was quick to respond and answered all of my questions. My allergies did not bother me at all here. Overall, great visit. Thanks! Brad and Liz were great, the room was clean, and in a great location.  Would definitely stay here again. Again, great hosts. Brad and Liz were great. They were very welcoming and gave us some great tips about the area!\\r\\nThe space was very nice & comfortable and very close to a lot of great shopping and. Dining.\\r\\nWe wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay again! This is a very nice private bit of the house and we really enjoyed our stay here. Brad and Liz are super friendly and it was lovely to chat to them. I would highly recommend staying here! Also, Ballard is a lovely area... plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants. We had a great stay at Brad and Liz\\'s beautiful house. The apartment was very clean and spacious with everything we needed including a beautiful garden. brad was available very late to let us  in, show us around and give us pointers on where to go in the neighborhood. We were walking distance to all of the bars, restaurants and shops in Ballard and had a great time exploring the area and relaxing in the garden. Would definitely stay here again! This was an excellent place to stay in the beautiful neighborhood. The people were great and caring of us. The outside garden in the cats were great. Jacuzzi was fantastic as was the bed.  They should install a motion detector for the stairs going down to apartment.  If you forget to turn the light on at noon and come home at midnight it\\'s dark.  Definately will return.  Great space in a great neighborhood. Easy street parking. Very welcoming hosts! An absolutely charming house! Everything as described, very cute and cozy space, essentially an entire unit as opposed to a rented room. Brad and Liz were very hospitable and made my trip a great experience. Thanks!  Brad and Liz were great hosts, very pleasant and kind.The space was very clean, with coffee, tea and a mini fridge and kitchenette available for use. They also left maps of Seattle and info about things to do which was a great touch. The private entry was convenient for when we stayed out a little later. And lastly, the location was perfect!  Brad and Liz were very responsive from the beginning. They were flexible when our arrival times changed. The apartment was great and matches the description accurately.   The property was beautiful and the neighborhood was convenient and walkable.  I would definitely stay there again. Obwohl das Zimmer im Untergeschoß nicht der Beschreibung entsprach (Cottage), empfanden wir es sogar besser. Liz empfing uns sehr freundlich und wies uns in alle Dinge, die zu beachten sind, ein. Da unser Sohn in Ballard wohnt waren wir nur zum Schlafen da. \\r\\nBrad konnten wir erst bei beim Checkout sehen, da er verreist war. Es fand aber ein sehr herzliches Gespräch mit ihm statt, woraus zu  schließen ist, das er ein genauso prima Gastgeber wie Liz ist. Wir können die Unterkunft mit besten Eindrücken weiter empfehlen.  When we arrived, Brad showed us around the room/bathroom where we would be sleeping and getting ready, and then he sat down with us and chatted about what kinds of things there were to do around the area. He was extremely friendly and made great suggestions as to where to eat, what venues to check out, etc. He and Liz live in a beautiful residential neighborhood within walking area of breakfast places, nightlife, the bus system, and even the beach. We always felt safe walking back late at night and really loved the area.  Great basement studio with everything you need for a few days or a week. Close enough to Ballard shops and restaurants and adequate public transport to the rest of Seattle.   Great experience - Brad was a super nice guy and everything was there as promised. Very easy to get in and out of the house, didn\\'t have to disturb them either which was nice. Would stay again! Brad and Liz have a wonderful home! The space they rent is beautiful and well maintained - the Internet is speedy, the bed is comfy, and the neighborhood is quiet but near lots of lovely restaurants. They were kind and welcoming hosts, and I\\'d recommend them with 100% enthusiasm :) thank you both for having us!  Brad and Liz\\'s home is comfortable and situated in a really fun part of Ballard. Brad gave us a brief orientation to the neighborhood when we arrived which was really helpful. While we spent minimal time in the Alchemist\\'s Den, it was a nice, quiet outpost to explore Ballard and the rest of Seattle from for a couple of days. Thanks Brad and Liz! Beautiful lower-level space in Brad and Liz\\'s home, situated in a really cool city neighborhood. Brad was easily reached via cell and very warm and welcoming upon my arrival.  The place is equipped nicely with a very comfortable futon bed and sweet leather couch.  Nicely appointed bathroom is outside the actual space.  The garden outside is gorgeous and the two resident cats are very sweet and friendly. The location (Ballard) is very chill and features a lot of interesting places to hang out, as do the adjacent areas.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was my first experience renting a place like this and as far as I\\'m concerned, it was absolutely a home run in every way for me.  Next time I\\'m planning a Seattle trip, I will be checking these folks\\' availability first.   Thanks Brad and Liz.   Brad and Liz were very welcoming and easy to talk to. If you love books, you should be in heaven as there are books everywhere! The pictures are accurate, the location is awesome! Thank you! Brad and Liz were very welcoming and fun to talk with. My husband and I had a pleasant and relaxed stay.  We enjoyed the cats and the yard and the quiet neighborhood. The room was comfortable and as described, but the room is directly under the livingroom so you will hear a bit of upstairs activity.  We made good use of the kitchenette and wifi. The deep bath was a plus. We were out and about mostly; it was easy to walk to restaurants and the Locks from their charming home.   Thanks Brad and Liz. Great space. Great people! \\nHighly Recommended! Very nice place to stay in a very good neighborhood. Clean and set up nicely with plenty of room new furnishings. Of course you are staying in someone\\'s home in a private area, so you will hear normal family sounds in the main part of the house. Cats are a plus! Large comfortable room, bed is excellent. Garden level so its a great place to sleep in late! The room we stayed in was perfect for myself and my husband. We had lots of privacy however, felt comfortable asking Brad for anything we needed and he was accessible. The neighborhood was awesome and located in walking distance to downtown Ballard, which was so cute! I highly recommend staying here if you can, we had a wonderful experience.  Brad and Liz welcomed me directly. They were very warm and deeply fascinating. I had to put in effort not to monopolize Brad\\'s time. The neighborhood was perfect for my needs and, while I didn\\'t get to walk around as much as I would have liked, the area has a lot within easy walking distance. Their daylight basement was also comfy, cozy, and perfect for my needs. Very accommodating hosts, cute unique space with all the essentials. Was exactly what I needed. The location is an easy to walk to buses to get downtown and very close to some beautiful parks! The only things to note: the shower is a bit non traditional and took some getting used to. It\\'s not a completely private separate space, but the hosts were respectful and it was not a problem. I enjoyed my time here and would recommend it.  My parter and I stayed with Brad and Liz over the Thanksgiving holiday and enjoyed the space very much.  Our hosts were friendly and welcoming and the neighbourhood is quite lovely and close to all Ballard has to offer, which is quite a bit.  The bed was comfortable as described...and I am not a futon fan.   All this and just three blocks from the people we were visiting!  Changes?  Just one:  Unscented, \\'green\\' laundry products.  Otherwise -full marks! Upon arrival, I was warmly welcomed by Brad! He guided me through everything I\\'d need to know for my visit and made me feel very comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe space was everything I needed (and more) during my week long business trip in Seattle. The various amenities in Ballard were within walking distance, and Brad had very helpful recommendations for great food and coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would absolutely stay here in the future and can\\'t wait to visit Seattle again. Brad and Liz were wonderful hosts.  Spoke briefly with Brad the first day and from there was on my own.  Beautiful house in a great area.  Easy to get to bars and restaurants in Ballard as well as a short ride to Fremont.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to explore those areas and the rest of Seattle. Brad and Liz were great host and the Alchemist\\'s Den was lovely. Great folks,  cool accommodations, and friendly cat.  Brad and Liz provide a winning Seattle experience in the hip Ballard neighborhood.   Excellent stay! Pretty luxurious...warm, spacious, basically feels like your own apartment minus a stove. Very personable hosts as well. The room was exactly as advertised.  It was very clean and well taken care of.  Alex and Wei (hope I\\'m spelling that right) were great hosts and really left it up to me how much I interacted with them.  They gave me a key and the room has it\\'s own entrance so there\\'s as much privacy as you need.  They were more than willing to help me out with any requests like places I could eat.  There\\'s a great QFC 24 hr grocery store about 3 minutes walking distance and great shops around on market st.  On the way out, I left very early 5AM, but even so Alex made sure to be up to see me out.  Very friendly and welcoming hosts! I would definitely consider staying here again if I end up back out in Seattle. We had a great stay here. Alex and Wei were very inviting hosts. The room and bathroom were very clean. The room felt very private since it had its own entrance and was quite separate from the rest of the home. We also enjoyed the proximity to Ballard restaurants, shops and bars. Thanks so much!  This place was great. Nice and quiet. Easy for parking. The private access to the room was a real advantage. I highly recommend the hosts and the room. Very clean and quiet; also very private. This is a great neighborhood for walking. This was a great stay for me.  The room was private with its own entrance.  The room was clean, it is exactly what you see online.  Soap and shampoo were provided in the bathroom.  Two bottles of drinking water were also in the room for guest.  I had to park my rental car over night in an unrestricted street parking.  Overall, the area seem to be safe  which also have a 24-hours supermarket and Starbucks coffee within walking distance.  The host was very friendly.  I wasn\\'t sure if she was just happened to be out front when I arrived, or if she wanted to help me find the house.  It made me feel quite welcome went she greeted me in front of her home.  I\\'d reserve this room again if I\\'m ever in the area. It was a nice space with a private entrance, and personal bathroom. The place was located north of downtown, with a convenient bus route to downtown nearby. It was about a 40 min bus ride to downtown, but less than 5 mins away from Fremount and Ballard. There is a great Puerto Rican restaurant called La Isla and a french bakery Cafe Besalu within walking distance.  The room was exactly as described and depicted. Immaculate and well-appointed. Alex was very accessible and Wei was most welcoming. I highly recommend their airBnB! The room was as advertised; very clean and the private entrance was a great addition.  Great location in downtown Ballard.  The house is within walking distance to several stores and all of the restaurants, bars, shops, etc. that Ballard has to offer.  It\\'s also easy to get downtown thanks to nearby buses. The room is comfy and bright.  So no complaints.  The room was exactly as described: nice, private, and comfortable.\\r\\nThe neighborhood is nice and calm, very close to a bus stop that brings directly to the city center (for sightseeing and the like).\\r\\nHighly recommended for short staying in Seattle. I was most welcomed by Wei and shown my room, etc. I love the private entry and private bath. This room was in a perfect location for the event I was attending. I had everything I needed: comfy bed, desk, chair, etc just as you see in the picture. The only contact I had with the hosts was at my arrival, but I was able to easily contact them if I needed to. I can\\'t wait to stay here on my next visit to Seattle. Though we didn\\'t meet Alex, Wei was very welcoming and considerate. Everything we needed was already included in the room (blow dryer, shampoo, towels, water, hangers etc). The room itself is very private, with a side entrance and private washroom with shower. The bed was big and comfortable. Everything was spotlessly clean! The best stay we\\'ve had with an Airbnb host so far. We\\'d love to stay here again. This stay exceeded our expectations.  Alex and his wife were very nice, and welcomed us warmly.  They have smartly sectioned off the lower bedroom and bathroom and it really feels like you have a nice space to yourself with plenty of privacy.   The location is also excellent, you are just steps away from all of the awesome things in downtown Ballard.  Stay here, you won\\'t be disappointed! Hosts were great and the room was just as advertised.  I would not hesitate to rent their room in the future should I be going back to SEattle The reservation was canceled 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. The reservation was canceled 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. My husband and I stayed at Alex and Wie\\'s home during our visit to Seattle.  Their room is exactly like it is shown in the pictures and it has it\\'s own private entrance which makes it easy to come and go as we pleased.  The location could not be beat, it is located a quick walk away from the main drag in Ballard.  Lots of bars and restaurants in the area.  Alex and Wie were both friendly and made sure that we had everything needed for our stay.  We definitely recommend anyone to stay at their home. We stayed at Alex\\'s place for 2 nights in October to attend a wedding nearby. It is an incredibly convenient location, practically a 2 min walk to all the shops, restaurants, and cafes in downtown Ballard, but still located on a quiet side street. If you don\\'t feel like renting a car, there is also a lot of cheap public transportation nearby (by bus, it\\'s about 30 mins to downtown Seattle, and about 90 mins to airport). Even for a whole weekend, we felt there was so much to do and see in Ballard that we mever left the area!\\n\\nThe room was cozy and comfy, we had our own bathroom, and everything was clean and simple. Alex was very friendly and courteous. We would highly recommend this place for anyone traveling to Seattle! My fiancé and I had a wonderful stay at Alex\\'s residence.  The room and bathroom were very clean and it had everything we needed.  It\\'s in a perfect location to explore the Ballard area.  We loved having our own entrance so we never felt intrusive.  Bed was super comfy! We stayed here for a long weekend in October. The room was exactly as pictured, very clean, cozy and private, with its own entrance. The private bath was also very clean. The location is excellent, close to all of the shops, cafes and restaurants in downtown Ballard, and also very convenient to public transportation. I didn\\'t meet Wei; Alex was a great host, friendly and very accessible if there was anything we needed. I would certainly stay here again.  Alex\\'s room was clean and comfortable. I would recommend. Accommodations were perfect and just as described.  It was exceptionally clean, well-maintained and had a very comfortable bed.  The separate entrance was a plus.  Coordination w/ Alex was quick and easy.  His wife welcomed me upon my arrival and gave me keys and a quick tour.  After that, I was on my own.  Will definitely do a repeat should the occasion present itself.  Our stay was very enjoyable. Alex was easy to communicate with and his wife met us on arrival to show us the room and was very friendly.  The room and bathroom were very clean and tidy and everything was as described. The bed is comfortable and the location is within easy walking distance of the downtown Ballard area. A great place to stay for sure. I had a wonderful experience staying with Alex and Wei. I arrived in the afternoon and Wei greeted me. She gave me an overview of the room and after that I did not see them. It was a very comfortable, private and close to everything in Ballard. I was able to walk to the grocery store and to breakfast close by each morning. I did not have the chance to meet Alex in-person, but he was in communication with me to set up the arrangements and was very helpful. The bedroom and bathroom were extremely clean and like new. I especially liked the private entrance to the room because it allowed me to come and go on my own time without disturbing them. I would certainly love to stay there again if I am ever in the area! Very nice, very clean and comfortable place. Excellent location,  can walk everywhere. I stayed at Alex\\'s place for 3 days and I had a great time. Street parking was available at anytime of the day within 2 min walking distance. Alex was available and made my stay more comfortable. The place was very quiet and having your own private entrance was practical. I would recommend staying at Alex and you are only 5 min away from the active part of the Ballard.  Accurate listing, very private and nice, helpful hosts.   Great place in Ballard! Super clean, private and very very walkable. 3-4 blocks from some of the best restaurants the area has to offer. Wei was very nice and welcoming when I came to pick up the key. The space was comfy and the bathroom is private which is great (just outside the bedroom in a small hallway). Will definitely stay again on my next trip to the area! The house is extremely well located within minutes of Market Street and Ballard Street where all the restaurants/shops are. Ballard is a beautiful part of Seattle.\\r\\nGood value for money for sure, everything was very clean. Coffee and tea in the room definitely a nice touch!\\r\\nWould definitely stay there again. Wow! The location was just wondeful. Perfect for our trip. We had a lot to see and Alex\\'s place was ideal for a spot to regroup.\\n\\nThe bed was comfortable and clean. I loved the kitty tray t stress the location. Perfect. Another great stay at Alex\\'s - very private, convenient and comfortable.  Exactly as desired and nice hosts as well. Alex & Wei\\'s private room in the ground floor of their Ballard condo is as pictured - clean, well-appointed, and stylish. We were greeted by Wei who was very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed.  The bed is extremely comfortable and the location is perfect--a quick walk to the best of Ballard eateries. Would definitely stay again! If you\\'re interested in checking out Ballard and the rest of Seattle, stay with Alex! This private room is nicely separated from the rest of the home and made for a great stay. Alex has fantastic communication and made check in super easy. With the private entrance it felt like we had the place to ourselves! The only amenity \"missing\" was a mini fridge - but of course that is just personal preference. The location is PRIME and very close to Ballard shops and night life. You can even bike to the beach easily.   Had a lovely and comfortable stay at Alex and Wei\\'s place! Alex replied to messages promptly. Met his wife, Wei, during check-in. Wei made check-in easy and showed us the space. Room and bathroom were clean and spacious. This was our first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful! My fiancé and I will actually be back for a second night this week after a short visit to Vancouver.  Our second stay at Alex\\'s was great. We had the opportunity to check out the immediate area this time around - their place is within walking distance to many restaurants! Would recommend staying here!  Just spent only one night. The private room was clean and very functional.  With coffee maker, we felt like in the hotel room.  The private room entrance is segregated so we don\\'t have to worry about when we come in and go out.\\r\\nThe neighbor is quite and very close to many different stores (including Starbucks), all within in 4-8 minutes walking distance.\\r\\nThe host was very kind. I was really pleased with this choice.  The room was separate from the house, giving you a little privacy.  The bed and bathroom was nice and clean and I felt really comfortable.  And it is not too far from downtown Seattle.  I would definitely recommend this place. Very accurate description - no problems at all getting the keys, good communication throughout and wonderfully comfortable, clean room with private bathroom.\\r\\nIf I am in the area again, I wouldn\\'t hesitate to book this place.  It\\'s well located to DT Ballard and buses to DT Seattle, the hosts have left good local and regional maps in the room, plus a Seattle To Do guide.\\r\\nQuiet, peaceful and a pleasure to come back to after a lovely day out in the city...it\\'s a good size space and one doesn\\'t feel cramped.\\r\\nInternet access is easy - and there\\'s a coffee machine plus microwave should you need it, with a large 24 hr supermarket a mere minutes away. Everything was great and well organized. The neighborhood is pretty nice! We just arrive home from our stay  in this private room just walking distance from Ballard. It is a perfect location and quiet and lovely. Our accommodations were spotless. Our hostess greeted us upon arrival, showed us around, assured us if we needed anything, to just ask.  We had coffee and microwave and mini-fridge in the room; crisp clean towels and great bath products in our private bath. And we had our own private entrance! She even showed us the best way to walk to/from the wedding we were attending. And a GREAT grocery store 1/2 block way for anything we needed!\\r\\nIt was a great place to stay and in my opinion, even better than represented! Thank you for a terrific overnight in Ballard, Seattle, WA!!\\r\\n Great experience. The room was clean and comfortable. We really appreciated the privacy of the room and the private bathroom. Thanks! This place was amazing! The location is very close to downtown Ballard. The mini fridge and microwave were very useful especially as there was a QFC close by. Everything was super clean and we felt very comfortable there. Would definitely stay there again! We had such a lovely time in Seattle! Our stay at Alex\\'s was perfect. She was very welcoming and accommodating (I arrived late due to a long hike and she was very understanding). The room was setup with guests in mind. Bathroom was spacious with new fixtures. It was very clean, and had all of the amenities that are listed. Honestly couldn\\'t offer any suggestions as to how they could improve the room, bravo! \\r\\nBallard is a nice neighborhood. It feels very safe and this place is in walking distance to Market where all the action happens. If we come back to Seattle we will absolutely be staying here again! Clean, basic room with great coffee for in the morning. Easy side acces to airbnb room and indoor acces to the bathroom. Friendly host who showed us everything in the house on arrival. The room was nice and clean. The setting was quiet and the location was fantastic. The host was nice upon arrival, but was inflexible before arrival. If you offer to rent your space you should be flexible for a late arrival. Was given an ultimatum to stay out in the streets with luggage if I could not arrive by 4pm because they had plans. Was told I could only return after 9pm. I changed travel plans to arrive by 4pm and the host didn\\'t leave until 5 pm. I was irritated with the inflexibility, but otherwise the place was nice. Thanks Alex and Wan Ju for the host! We stayed in their place for three nights and it was such a great experience, above and beyond our expectations. The room was so clean and we got independent entrance and bathroom. And the house was sitting in a very convenient but quiet neighborhood. Alex and Wan Ju were so nice, hosting us like friends and made us feel very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again when next time visiting Seattle! Very comfortable, clean, and quiet! The location is great,  easy to walk to many locations in Ballard. This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was great. The room was very clean. The bed was comfortable. The wifi was solid. The water pressure in the shower was excellent. The bathroom was clean, and the towels were great. There was good shampoo and soap in the bathroom for us. There was ample closet space. We also really appreciated the maps and guides/pamphlets to the local area.  Very clean, organized and comfortable.  Location in a great neighborhood, convenient to restaurants and shops.  Great place for our one night stay over in Seattle.   Staying at Alex\\'s sweet home is definitely one of the highlights of my trip to Seattle. Alex & Wei are very considerate: The room is super clean and has everything I need for a short trip (Fridge, Microwave, Coffee machine, fast wifi & etc). They are very responsive too. Every time I sent them a message, they replied very quickly. \\r\\nThe area is very safe and convenient - There are tons of street parking places and many choices of food. \\r\\nThis is my first time using Airbnb and I was a little bit hesitant before, but not anymore! Thanks guys and hopefully I could stay at your place the next time I visit Seattle.\\r\\nP.S. They could also speak Mandarin, so feel free to speak in Mandarin if you prefer. This was my very first experience with Airbnb, and Alex and Wei made it better than I could have imagined. Their home is conveniently located near TONS of restaurants/bars/stores in Ballard; we were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go. And yet, the neighborhood is not busy and very quiet!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room and bathroom is extremely clean and private. Our bed was very comfortable. There is a mini refrigerator available, desk space, a Keurig with coffee and utensils provided. They left us plenty of information about the Seattle area regarding things to do. Wei let us know to text them if we needed anything, and provided us with a key for our own private entrance when we arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will not hesitate to stay with Alex and Wei when I return to this area. It was more pleasant and simpler than staying at a hotel, and Alex and Wei are accommodating hosts. Thank you both, and thanks Airbnb!  This was my first time using Airbnb and I was very pleased with the experience. The room was perfect for what I needed and the neighborhood had a lot to offer for restaurants, shopping, and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was clean and offered privacy both in sleeping and bathroom accommodations.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was scheduled to arrive late anyway and then my flight was delayed. I informed Alex early in the day about my flight and he was very understanding and said he would stay up until I arrived. If I ever need to stay in Seattle again I wouldn\\'t have any second thoughts about staying here. Loved this place! The place comes with its own private entrance, spacious room, and private bathroom. The room was nice and clean and there was pretty much everything we needed there! One big thing was, they even have a heater for you for the night time when it gets cold. That was awesome. The location is conveniently located to a market and some other stores as well. Defs would recommend this place and would come back here to stay if I\\'m ever visiting Seattle again! Alex\\'s suite in Seattle\\'s Ballard neighbourhood is simple, clean and very private.  For any queries, Alex was super responsive via text. The suite itself is literally steps from so many restaurants, pubs, and even a pie bar (it\\'s exactly what you\\'d imagine - we had dinner there one night!)  A super fun neighbourhood, and the #40 bus is also only a block away which goes through Fremont all the way to downtown quite quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe loved staying in the neighbourhood and had a very seamless stay in Alex\\'s suite. If you\\'re planning to stay here, know that you will have a private place to call home for the duration of your stay with exactly what you need but not much more. Alex was a fantastic and accommodating host and a really nice guy.  This location could not be better--a very safe and quiet neighborhood with readily available parking, and a short walk to some of the best restaurants and sights in town.  Incredibly clean and well equipped room.  Could not have had a better experience. This was the perfect location in Ballard. Clean, quiet, everything as advertised! I loved staying at Will\\'s place. Im having our house renovated so taking a break from the mess to stay at an airbnb meant I nearly cried at how clean and comfortable this place is. While the unit is small, everything about the set up was very thoughtful and had everything we needed. This place is also super convenient being a few blocks from all the shops and great Ballard restaurants.  Fantastic quiet bedroom! Akin to a hotel, except on a residential side street. Quick and easy walk to neighborhood amenities like the grocery store and bus. The room is really well kept and comfortable. Will\\'s studio was perfect!  The location is great, near restaurants and bakeries in Ballard and certainly within walking distance to just about anything in the neighborhood.  The bed in the unit is comfortable, the space is immaculately maintained, it is really a perfect and very private hideaway in this very desirable neighborhood. Nice, clean space in a great Ballard location. Nice place in a convenient location -- short walk to the various shops and restaurants of Ballard. Clean. Comfortable bed, tasteful decor. Nice shower, good closet space. As pictures indicate, room is very small and doesn\\'t get very good light; the block isn\\'t particularly charming. Street parking was very easy. Our hosts kindly left water, yogurts, and a nice selection of teas, and they were easy to communicate with. Staying at Will\\'s place was wonderful. The location can\\'t be beat and the studio was perfect for two people. We spent most of our time wandering around the city and saved the studio for primarily sleeping. We\\'d definitely stay again! Perfect little space, exactly where I needed to be. Comfortable, warm, clean, and the complimentary beverages and popcorn got me through a tough evening, when I was too busy to acquire dinner! Thank you, Will, and congratulations on an excellent accommodation.  The place looks brand-new.  Nicely located near the heart of Ballard, with lots of restaurants to choose from.  Nice host, too.\\r\\nThank you for the nice weekend.  Highly recommended. Great location! My boyfriend and I LOVED Will\\'s place. It\\'s a small space but in a good way... very cozy. We were left cold drinks, coffee, tea and a couple snacks. It was perfectly decorated and so so clean. There is a large walk-in closet to store your things. We would absolutely stay here again. Thank you! I recently relocated to Seattle. Will\\'s listing was the perfect location for me. I originally booked a longer stay, and during the whole process, Will was nothing but understanding and helpful during the brief times I heard from him. The listing was clean and spotless. Smelled almost like a hotel room...the good kind  The accommodations were exceptional and Andrea was a delightful host! The listing was exactly as described in a very charming house on a quiet, residential Ballard street. I had no trouble finding street parking on the same block, even when arriving late on weekend nights.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrea attended to every little detail prior to my check-in and stayed in constant communication with me throughout my stay, even when our schedules did not align to speak in person. She was flexible with my arrival time and greeted me at the door when I made it to Seattle (I loved meeting her charming and super-friendly dog, too!).\\r\\n\\r\\nHer apartment was fully stocked and quite comfortable. The kitchen had a variety of teas and coffee (perfect for early mornings!) and the WiFi was fast and reliable. It was quite warm during my stay, but the apartment stayed comfortably cool with a great cross-breeze from the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was my first airbnb experience and Andrea definitely set the bar quite high! I would recommend her listing without hesitation to anyone looking for more authentic and charming accommodations in the Seattle area. We liked our stay at Andrea\\'s place very much. Apartment is very cozy, charmy, convenient and extremely clean. Its also not small, pretty spacious. Very comfortable big firm bed in the bedroom and Adrea also provided for us an extra foam bedding to sleep on the lining room\\'s floor which was comfy as well. House itself is all surrounded with trees and flowers like a countryside escape, but it is just 5 mins walk from all the infrastructure of Ballard: huge grocery, gym, tones of restaurants, cafes, bus lines, etc. Thanks a lot to Andrea for our nice stay!  Andrea\\'s place was great and just what we needed for our short stay. Communication with her was seamless and we had no trouble with finding the place or any other logistics.  What a great experience ! Andrea is a perfect host, friendly, with good tips to discover Ballard, and her place is a cozy gem in a beautiful and peaceful neighbourhood, close by walk to different bars and coffees and the bus stop for downtown. Our fisrt stay in Seattle was such a great moment, and we\\'ll definetly come back at Andrea\\'s place. Five stars recommandations !!!! Andrea\\'s apartment was fantastic! It was clean, quiet and beautifully decorated. Andrea provided thoughtful amenities, including bagels and cream cheese for our first morning and a wide selection of tea. The location was ideal, located in a trendy neighbourhood and very close to transit making exploration of the city convenient. Andrea was a wonderful host! Although we didn\\'t interact much, she was always one text message or knock on the door away :)  Andrea\\'s place is such a lovely,and  extremely clean place.\\nThe flat is in à good location, close to gardens and an interesting night Life. Andrea\\'s place was impeccably clean and quiet. The house is within walking distance of so many cute little restaurants and bars, and right on the edge of everything great about Seattle without being in the hectic downtown/touristy areas. \\r\\n\\r\\nAndrea made sure we got in safe, provided us with plenty of coffee, and bagels for our first morning. Then let us be to enjoy our weekend. I would highly recommend this place and will gladly stay here again the next time I\\'m in Seattle. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdvice for future travelers; you are staying directly above Andrea, on the upper floor of her home. We had complete privacy and autonomy, and we are the kind of travelers who enjoy peace and quiet; but I think if you are looking to party, you should stay elsewhere, this is a peaceful place.  The apartment was perfect!  Great neighborhood, safe and central to lots of restaurants and activities in Ballard.  Andrea was the perfect host.  And her dog was pretty cute too.  We\\'ll definitely stay here again on future trips to Seattle.  Highest recommendation. Andrea\\'s upstairs apartment is well-located and stocked with all the amenities a traveler needs. It\\'s a short walk from the central commercial district and the waterfront, but the apartment has a rustic charm that gave us the sense that we were in a more bucolic setting. Andrea was a gracious host, and was accommodating of our itinerary. Highly recommended! My hostess provided information about public transport. This easily guided me to the bnb from the airport. She was there to greet me, show me around the apartment and provide some information/orientation to the neighborhood. The apartment was perfect! Cozy...impeccably clean and well appointed. I loved it! Our month\\'s stay at Andrea\\'s place was truly a blessing! We enjoyed the warm, artsy decor of her duplex apartment. Andrea was such a welcoming & gracious host, and yet still respectful of our privacy. Quite a refreshing \"home away from home\" experience. Plus, her place is located just a few blocks away from downtown Ballard with a wonderful variety of restaurants, shops & boutiques, cafés, a movie theatre, and grocery markets. We would definitely recommend Andrea\\'s place to anyone visiting Seattle or anyone seeking an all-around, great sublet!! This was my first visit to Seattle and Andrea\\'s spot is in a perfect location! It is only a short walk to the Ballard district which is bustling with fun bars, breweries, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. There is also a bus stop just around the corner to downtown Seattle. My main priority is cleanliness and Andrea\\'s place is exceptional! She is also a perfect hostess leaving hand-detailed maps and a book of menus with personal notes about them. On top of all this, Andrea is very quick to respond to any questions or requests. I would definitely recommend this spot!\\r\\n Nice apartment. It was very cozy, and a great location. Would totally stay there again. Andrea is an excellent host! Not only is the apartment as lovely as pictured, she also went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable. She had a booklet of breakfast places within walking distance, and a printed map of the neighborhood (Ballard) we were staying in. She also provided teas, which we enjoyed tremendously and even gave us a heads up about a local farmers market (which we had mentioned previously we were interested in). Everything was super clean (I did pilates so I know that her carpet was freshly vacuumed) and nice. The neighborhood was really great too, we loved walking around it, and it was close to downtown and other cool little neighborhoods like Freemont. Basically stay here you guys, the apt is great, and so is Andrea! We loved our recent stay at Andrea\\'s place in Seattle! Thanks, Andrea, for being so welcoming and accommodating. The house is in such a great location - quiet enough to get work done and a good night\\'s sleep, but only a few minutes walk away from great coffee, food, shops, and all the other fun things in Ballard. Visiting in December, I was so grateful for how cozy and warm the apartment was, as well as how spacious it felt, since I needed to get some work done during the day. I especially loved the living room with the big window, comfy couch, huge soft blanket, and the artful touches and pictures. We\\'d love to come back! This was a clean, quiet, enjoyable place to stay very close to whatever amenities you could ask for: restaurants, grocery stores, interesting sites, public transportation. I slept very well here, the neighborhood and host are very quiet and the bed is comfortable. Andrea was very easy to communicate with and accommodating. Her place was cozy and comfortable- a great size for one person or a couple. My mother stayed here for a week and a half and thought it was perfect. \"Downtown\" Ballard is in easy walking distance and the cafes of 24th ave are just a stones throw away.  Awesome neighborhood, awesome place, awesome host.  Totally perfect! This was a great place for us to escape to while visiting our son and granddaughter in Ballard. The apartment was warm, cosy and well equipped. We had everything we needed to cook a meal after our days of babyminding and the local supermarket is very close by. There are also plenty of great coffee places and a range of other places to eat. The local cinema is also good.\\r\\nAndrea was easy to communicate with and we hope that the apartment is free when we come again later in the year.  Andrea\\'s place was perfect for us and just as advertised. Awesome location from which to explore Seattle if you\\'ve never been or just to hang out in Ballard. Would definitely recommend to others.  Andrea is a wonderfully capable and welcoming host.  We were impressed by the effort she expended to make certain that we were comfortable and fully informed as to the details of staying in her apartment.  She made it very clear that we were welcome to call upon her with any questions or needs that might arise during the course of our stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment itself is quite comfortable and nicely equipped with all of the essentials, excluding a TV, which was fine by us.  Very conveniently located in Ballard, close to a metro stop that makes getting around in Seattle easy and inexpensive.  Highly rated! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Ballard. Andrea was quite accommodating and easy to get a hold of. She made sure we had everything we needed and was quick to respond to any questions we had. The apartment was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Great restaurants, bars, and coffee shops were just a short walk away and downtown Seattle was only a 15 minute drive. \\r\\nAndrea\\'s will definitely be our first choice when we return to Seattle! great spot in Ballard! Has all the things you might need and the best location!  Andrea personally greeted us and was very warm and friendly. She had many excellent recommendations for the area that we took full advantage of. She was prompt with all communications and we loved her cozy apartment. It was obvious that she took great care to ensure a pleasant stay for her guests. The Ballard location was fantastic and the immediate neighborhood was charming. Andrea\\'s place in Ballard was great. The apartment is very well equipped and super cute. The location is great. Andrea was always very helpful and accommodating.  I would recommend staying with Andrea.  Andrea is a fantastic host. She is very welcoming and made sure that I had everything that I needed to make my stay comfortable. The apartment is spacious and bright in a fantastic location, walking distance to great restaurants and shops. I would highly recommend. Wir haben uns bei Andrea sehr wohlgefühlt. Die Wohnung befindet sich in einem kleinen Haus. Das komplette Dachgeschoss ist sehr nett und einladend eingerichtet. In der Küche fanden wir alles was für einen mehrtägigen Aufenthalt notwendig war. Geschäfte sind fußläufig zu erreichen. Die Haltestelle Downtown erreicht man in 5 Gehminuten, Downtown mit dem Bus in ca 30 Minuten.\\r\\nAndrea ist eine nette, freundliche Gastgeberin, sodass wir spontan um eine Nacht verlängert haben.\\r\\nDanke für einen netten Aufenthalt in Seattle ! Andrea was a great host! Friendly and helpful. The apartment is very close to the bus and an easy ride to down town. The apartment is very clean and spacious. Ballard, the neighborhood the apt is in, has lots of cool coffee shops and restaurants. Also Andrea had excellent communication with us both before the trip and when we arrived. We would recommend this apt to anyone staying in Ballard! Andrea was a terrific host, friendly and very knowlwdgable about the neighborhood.  Her place is very comfortable and had everything we needed for a monthlong stay.  It is ideally located, in walking distance to the heart of Ballard, with easy access to the Burke-Gilman bike path, and only half a block from the the Route 40 bus to downtown.  Highly recommended! Andrea made us feel very welcome.she made sure that we were comfortably settled in and asked to ask for anything that we needed.We would recommend Andrea\\'s place3 for any visit to Seattle in the interesting locale of Ballard. Excellent stay. The space was super cute and so many conveniences were already stocked, a fan, power strip, tea. Instructions were clear and easy to understand.  Clean  and great amount of space. Hope to stay again. Host was friendly and key exchange was quick and convenient. Also Spork is awesome!! The apartment was cozy, well-appointed, and fully stocked. The location was very convenient for access to good food, good coffee, and several bus lines.  Andrea had everything we could possibly want and more waiting for us. The apartment was cute and cozy and we felt welcome the minute we walked in. We couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to stay while visiting Seattle. Andrea was a great hostess!!!! Her place was very cozy and clean. It is in a great area and walking distance from tons of entertainment and restaurants. We will definitely look for this residence again when we come back to visit. Andrea met me at the door to provide a key and explain everything I needed to know. After that I came and went without running into her again but had the offer to contact her if I needed anything. The apartment was very spacious and had everything I needed. It is in terrific location with downtown Ballard just a few blocks away. Was easy to find parking and get to other areas of downtown Seattle. Loved my visit in Seattle!  Very clean and comfortable Airbnb.   Quiet and cute neighborhood.  Travelling alone I was unsure about walking around by myself.  I felt very comfortable as I walked the 5 minute walk to downtown Ballard a number of times.  I am not a big city person so staying a bit north of Seattle in  the small town of Ballard. was perfect. \\r\\nI did not have the pleasure of meeting Andrea but we connected a couple of times by text/email.   She was a wonderful host in many ways!   Thank you Andrea for making my stay in \"Seattle\" so nice. Spacious, clean and very cozy. We felt right at home. Ballard is a beautiful neighborhood filled with cafes, bars and restaurants. It\\'s safe and quiet. We loved the local movie theatre too. Also, a supermarket, a gym and the bus stops are really close by. Additionally, the kitchen was well equipped. Andrea was super nice and helpful. We will definitely return sometime! Excellent; clean, spacious, convenient, wonderful host. This was our first experience with Airbnb, and completely positive!  Andrea responded quickly to our request for a reservation, and we enjoyed everything about our stay in her cozy and bright apartment.  We will be back! Great location and friendly host. Heidi was very accommodating.\\r\\n Heidi was a very informative host, helping us with local recommendations. The neighborhood is great, dogs are sweet, and our stay was pleasant once we got there. Be aware of where you can park and you\\'ll be sure to enjoy the experience. Fantastic location in the main, hip area of Ballard....walk direclty from the apartment to hip boutiques and coffee shops. Heidi was very helpful with accommodating my schedule and providing me great stops to eat and drink in the area. Very sweet dogs. The perfect crash pad and a gracious host!  What a perfect location for enjoying Seattle and especially the Ballard area. Walk out the door and you can experience great eating and fun shopping.  Heida was extremely  accommodating and very gracious.  Heidi went out of her way to make us feel welcome and the location was great! Felt right at home within minutes. Great host This was our first AirBNB experience and it was fantastic!  Clean house, Heidi was friendly and made us feel right at home and at the same time gave us our own space.  Her dogs are sweet and adorable.   Heidi was great, met me at the door and introduced me to her two super cute dogs. She was very friendly and was always around for a chat and suggest things to do/see.\\r\\nThe place itself was excellent, right on a street with plenty of nightlife, very cool decor and was exactly the type of place I wanted to stay at while in Seattle. I felt completely comfortable with Heidi from our first conversation on the phone. Her home was open and very friendly from the moment I arrived. \\nOnly had overnight but felt like I left with a new friend in Seattle. \\nAs far location. You\\'re in the heart of Ballard with more cool people and  places than you\\'ll ever see in one trip. Heidi was very welcoming and made our stay quite easy. Her place is in the middle of Ballard, which is what we were looking for while visiting our son. We could walk everywhere we wanted to go. The loft provides an adequate amount of privacy and plenty of room. There is some noise from the alley when the garbage trucks come through early in the morning.  We really enjoyed staying in this townhouse in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. It\\'s very spacious and in a great location! We could walk to bars, restaurants, parks, the locks and more. It\\'s a very clean house. We had three guests, so one person slept on the couch, which was really comfortable.  I was in Ballard with 2 friends to do some wedding dress shopping, although we did not have a baby, the baby friendly townhouse was great for us. Plenty of space and everything we needed for our stay. The location is fantastic, we loveeeeee Ballard! We were there in July and it was great to be able to open all the windows and get a nice cross breeze! One of us slept on the couch which was big and comfortable. Barrie was a breeze to communicate with and we had no trouble getting in to the house.  We had a lovely visit in this house. It was clean, comfortable and well stocked with toys for a family with young children. It\\'s very close to the main drag in Ballard as well as several other amenities such as the library and supermarket. Description is very accurate! Barrie\\'s home was a lovely place to stay with our little daughter. We were so happy to arrive and felt right at home. The house is well laid-out and super clean, and we all slept soundly. All the toys and books were much appreciated. We used the bikes to go to Portage Bay Cafe (amazing) and the locks. Great neighborhood and wonderful accommodation. Many thanks! Absolutely great location and house was just as described.  A very cozy place with everything we needed.  We loved being minutes from the Ballard Locks and the cute breakfast places.  Barrie was very good at communicating with us and left lots of great instructions and local suggestions once we arrived.  We had a great stay and will stay again if we\\'re in Seattle. We had a bit of trouble getting into the house, some trouble with the lock sticking, but after we got in it was smooth sailing. The house is very cozy and comfortable and my son loved playing with all of the toys. It was very easy for us to walk into downtown Ballard from this location.  We stayed a few nights at Alan\\'s apartment in Ballard and it was lovely! Apartment was quaint and quiet, but close to everything, including the Chittenden Locks and the bus lines. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlan was a fantastic host and made sure we had everything we needed. He even printed out a few restaurant suggestions and a museum recommendation for us. Ballard is a fun neighborhood with tons of great restaurants and shops nearby; we really enjoyed staying here!  Great location, nice neighborhood.  Across the street from the locks, walking distance to downtown Ballard.  Good restaurants in the area.  Alan had coffee beans, bagels and flowers waiting for us.  Alan was a great host. He was very accommodating (we were driving into Seattle from Minneapolis and arrived at 1am to have his awaiting our arrival). He was short and sweet but made sure that we knew where things were in the house and ensured we knew how to get into the house. \\n\\nAlan also left many suggestions for local eateries and cafes in the area as well as leaving us a bowl of fruits and a fresh bag of coffee which was awesome! \\n\\nOverall, Alan was great and very helpful. Alan was fantastic! He was so accommodating of my shifting schedule. The apartment itself is beautiful and clean. The location is perfect! We had such a great time staying at this air bnb. The spot was perfect! It really is in the heart of Ballard. It was very easy to find and the hosts were very helpful. Lots of room and a giant kitchen to cook in. We couldn\\'t have asked for anything better.  Great location in the heart of Ballard. Very private, parking was easy. It\\'s a unique space in the basement of a beautiful old building. Quirky decorations from the 70\\'s, a selection of books and games to entertain you and wifi. Host was friendly and easy to work with. It was a little dark and musty but that\\'s to be expected for a Seattle basement, we had a great time. We had a lovely time staying at Odd Lodging in Ballard. The space is clean and comfortable, and has a quirky vintage vibe. Location can\\'t be beat, and Sandy was extremely friendly and quick to respond with any questions. I would absolutely book again, thanks for a fantastic stay!  Nora and Odd Lodging made staying with them super easy! Check in and check out were coordinated directly with us. The lodging was very comfortable. Super quite off the alley. Short cab ride to down town. The Ballard neighborhood has many great restaurants and bars. Kayaking Puget Sound, and the locks are a short walk down the road. Cool cafes near by as well. Thanks for letting us stay with you guys! Clean, cozy and quiet. Great neighborhood. Exactly what we were looking for. We had a great stay in a great neighborhood. Nora was very helpful.  It is an unorthodox venue, but worked very well for us.  The only changes I would make: Provide coffee and soap. Great location in a great neighborhood. It has a fully equipped kitchen, so you can cook a small meal if you get tired of eating out. Nora was quick and helpful in responding to all queries. Would have been good if the internet signal was stronger, but otherwise, our stay was super comfortable! Thanks for having us guys! We had a wonderful stay. Great location. We were able to walk to so many great restaurants. Downtown was just a short bus ride away. We would definitely stay again.  The Odd Lodging was a great place to stay! Perfect location, very close to public transit (which was good, since we had no car). Plenty of space and a cool vibe. We loved exploring Ballard and the rest of the city. The kitchen was fully equipped and the hosts very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Overall a great experience! The Ballard Odd Fellows Lodge, our host Martha, and the Ballard neighborhood were wonderful!  This was a great place to stay - we loved being right in the heart of Ballard, within easy walking distance to a lot of cool stuff (a great brunch spot, the locks, cafes, breweries).  We could not believe how large the apartment was for the price.  Martha was so welcoming and accommodating; she even gave us a tour of the Odd Fellows building and shared some of the history.  Staying at the Odd Fellows Lodge was a great part of our trip to Seattle and we\\'ll look it up again the next time we are there! \\r\\n Really loved staying at Odd Lodging!  Such a nice little apartment, charming and unique with all the amenities you\\'d want in a private studio (though really even more than a studio since the kitchen and bedroom are pretty much their own rooms too!) Not to mention you\\'re right in the middle of a great neighborhood with lots of fun shops, bars, and restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartha was incredibly helpful and responsive to any questions we had.  A real pleasure and highly recommended!  Definitely worth it  The apartment is clean and welcoming. Remember, it\\'s the old caretaker\\'s spot in the back of an Odd Fellows Lodge, not a Hilton. So you need to be someone who appreciates quirky local history to get the most out of this place. But, if you don\\'t, you will like the kitchen and the fact that you\\'re a three minute walk from a fantastic market. \\r\\n> Host was super friendly, attended to everything. \\r\\n> Again, this is an \\'odd\\' place, best-suited to those who prefer urban adventure to packaged experiences. If you love Dwell Magazine, you should probably consider an artsy little loft instead. But if you like vinyl records (there\\'s a shop attached) and spaces that have an authentic patina, you\\'ll love it here.\\r\\n> Would I stay here again? You bet. Absolutely.  This was my first experience with airbnb, and this was a great place to stay.  It was clean, and had everything you need for a comfortable stay.  If you\\'re looking for simple and comfy, this is the place.  The Ballard area is filled with restaurants and bars.  I didn\\'t really use the kitchen, but everything is there if you want to cook your own meals.  There\\'s a Safeway two blocks away, and a Whole Foods a short bus ride away on the D line. This place was super cute and located in a great neighborhood! Great restaurants and bars nearby and really nice to come back in the evenings to a place with such privacy! Very welcoming hosts... We look forward to staying here again. The Odd Lodging was so convenient to everything in Ballard. Nora was great! Very accommodating, she walked me through directions from the airport and met me when I arrived in Ballard. Lodging is laid back, if you are looking for a Hilton with room service, this probably isn\\'t the place for you. The apartment was clean and stocked with everything you might need. There is convenient parking in the rear of the building for $5.00 a day. I loved the location on Market St. and will definitely consider staying there again when I return to Ballard.\\r\\n\\r\\n The Oddfellows Lodge apartment is in the perfect spot for everything. Close to bars and restaurants, easy to hop on public transit. \\n\\nThe space itself, though on a lower level, is homey and more welcoming than I expected from the pics. Comfy bed, lots of room for stuff and for lounging around. The entry is around the back and has a secure gate.\\n\\nCommunications were super easy and friendly. All in all, a great stay! Thanks! We really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was very cozy even in chilly Nov. We were so glad we chose  to stay in Ballard. It\\'s a great neighborhood with so many restaurants, bars, coffee shops and cute shops we were never bored.  We loved the charming one bedroom apartment on the first floor of the Ballard Odd Fellows Lodge! The location is amazing - steps to tons of bars and restaurants as well as transit access. The kitchen is fully stocked with any tool you need to make a feast. The outdoor hallway was mostly private and a nice area to hang out in as well. We will definitely stay there next time we\\'re in Seattle! This was perfect spot for me. Everything was clean and fucntional and the place is a bit bigger than the photos suggest. It has a full kitchen if you want to cook but being so close to lots of Ballard\\'s delicious restuarants I didn\\'t bother much. Nora was very easy to communicate with and she gave me a tour of the Lodge on arriving. An interesting building. The room was located in a good area and our host was very friendly and gave us a tour of the lodge. The room had all the basics except coffee, the water was hot, and the internet was fast. The street parking was close and free after 6pm and there are coffee shops and bars nearby. The window coverings were see-through though, so it was not as private as I would have liked. If you\\'re shy you\\'ll want to change in the bathroom and if you want to get romantic, this is not the place for you. There were events being hosted upstairs, but we were forewarned of this and none ran later than 10pm. It\\'s a great place to stay; Good location, lots of privacy, and good value for an apartment-like space. The Odd Fellows Apartment was great! It is located within walking distance to every place we wanted to go-restaurants, retail stores, grocery store, movie theater, and coffee shops. We felt that the apartment was very private despite other reviewers that mentioned the shear curtains. There are no other tenants in the building, however there are occasional meetings/gatherings upstairs. There was plenty of free street parking and the pay parking lot is located outside the entrance to the apartment ($5/day). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay here again!  Fantastic accommodations. Great location near downtown Ballard. Extremely quiet and spacious, coupled with a great price. One of the best airbnbs I\\'ve ever stayed at..would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Odd and amazing! This little nest was perfect for our trip! The kitchen is well stocked, the furniture was beautiful, eclectic and very comfortable, and the space allowed for entertaining our friends. The lodge is beautiful and a gem in Ballard. We will be back! Description is very accurate, great little spot to spread out in the heart of Ballard.  Would absolutely stay here again. This is an amazing space, and it\\'s in the middle of everything. The soaking tub is to die for, and I was appreciative of how stocked the kitchen was. Of course, it\\'s always good to find a green friendly space in Seattle. The only con is that the lodge can be a little noisy. There was a night that they were banging around way past midnight. But the coziness of the space made up for it for sure. A+ Our host let us in with open arms. Odd Lodge has such an amazing history to it and fun style that dates all the back to 1906, and we first walked in we got the grand tour of the entire building and a pitcher of homemade kombucha. \\r\\nBallard is the place to be. Our room was walking distance for so many bars, breweries, restaurants, shops, etc. If you want to go across town the bus stop is about a block away. Would 100% stay here again and recommend it to everyone!     This place was fantastic! My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the private little abode. The apartment is within walking distance of plenty of things to do around town and made us truly fall in love with Seattle. We will be back again! We loved the Odd Lodging at the Odd Fellows Lodge in Ballard! Such a cute apartment and with plenty of desk space for the work that always needs to be done even on vacation. We didn\\'t get to use the kitchen because Ballard has so many wonderful cafes, pubs, and coffee houses, but we plan to come back and stay for longer visits in the future and it is great that it has a fully stocked kitchen. Just a stop at TJs and dinner is served. Loved the great selection in the bookshelves. If it rains next visit, I will be curled up with a book on the comfy couch. If you are visiting Seattle, specifically Ballard, The Odd Fellows Lodging is an absolute dream. Nora was incredible sweet, accommodating and quick to respond to any texts we sent her. We are pretty private, so we had minimal interaction with anyone at the lodge, which we appreciate, however, it seemed Nora would be happy to be more involved should we have needed. \\r\\nThe apartment is super cute and vintage-y vibe, which was exactly our style. There is a pretty private entrance in the back through a locked gate. It was left for us super clean with all we could need. The kitchen is fully stocked with tools, should you wish to cook there, and the bathroom had fresh towels and toiletries. THE BED IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE THING WE HAVE EVER SLEPT ON. It was hard to get out of it sometimes! Some people mention the see-through curtains which I don\\'t think were an issue or that see-through at all. \\r\\nThe best part about this apartment is it\\'s location. It is perfectly placed in Ballard by all the incredible bars and restaurants of Market and Ballard Ave. We walked everywhere with ease. There is a bus stop right by it though, if you prefer that. \\r\\nWe will absolutely be back in the summer to stay with the Odd Fellows. I can not recommend this place enough.\\r\\n Warm welcome. Great space. Fantastic location. Clean! Secure! Good wifi! I will stay again and highly recommend.  We had a good experience staying at Odd Lodging. I briefly met our host but primarily communicated with her through text messages. She quickly responded to my questions and requests. We were very happy with both her hospitality and sense to respect our privacy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room itself was cute. It is tucked away in the back alley behind a store front, and is just below ground level (there are windows that are at ground level). Everything was clean when we arrived and the space had a nice, homey feel. \\r\\n\\r\\nBallard was a nice neighborhood to stay in. There are many bars are restaurants on the main street, and the Odd Lodging is only about 5 minutes away from a bus stop that will take you right downtown (to most tourist spots). We happened to have a car, but you could easily get around the city without one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only downside of our stay at the Odd Lodging was that the actual lodge hosted a party above the room we were staying one night. Our host advised us of the party before we arrived, and we didn\\'t think it would be a problem since we were planning to go bar-hopping that night anyways. Unfortunately, by boyfriend came down with the stomach flu that afternoon so we were stuck listening to loud music and shaking floors until well past midnight. I don\\'t blame our host for this bad experience at all...she definitely gave us fair warning of the party. However,  anyone looking to stay here should be aware that this may not be the best place for peace and quiet.  The place was great! Nora gave us a tour of the building and was very welcoming. This looks like it will be my \"go-to\" place to say in Seattle! This place was a great find! The apartment is clean, comfy and right in the middle of Ballard, which made it incredibly easy to get anywhere. I will gladly stay here again when I\\'m back in Seattle. The Odd Fellows lodge is a perfect location for exploring Ballard and the surrounding metropolitan Seattle area. It met our needs and then some. Highly recommended! We used to live in Seattle, so we were excited to come for a visit and stay in the thriving, vibrant Ballard neighborhood. The apartment is artistic, fun, inviting and very comfortable! It was great to have a full kitchen and living room seperated from the from the bedroom. The host included everything needed to prepare meals (although we ate out mostly, and had a devine Pagliacci pizza delivered). There were extra toiletries available to borrow in the bathroom (but we brought everything we needed). We even slept great on the comfortable bed which isn\\'t always the case when we travel since we love our Tempurpedic bed at home. It just felt so cozy and peaceful! The entry is from the alley 1/2 block off Market street, but we felt safe as there is a locking gate/fence to access the breezeway to the apartment. If you are looking for affordable lodging in a really cool \"walk-to-everything\" neighborhood of Seattle, this is perfect! Great place!  Walked to Ballard st. Place was very clean and convenient!!  We had a great time during our trip to Seattle. And the Odd Fellows Lodge felt like home right away. A perfect space for 2 friends to come back to after taking advantage of all of the things the Pacific Northwest has to offer. Nora was as friendly as she was helpful. And Ballard was the area to see! Will definitely be back!  My partner and I had a blast on our Seattle \"staycation\" with the Odd Fellows! Great communication and quick response made this last minute trip just perfect... we even added an addition day and it was so awesome!\\r\\nThe room was perfect, clean, bright, welcoming, and just all in all perfect for a getaway in the city! \\r\\nI would book again in a heart beat! I\\'ve already told many friends about the awesome getaway hidden below the coolest lodge in Ballard! The apartment at the Odd Fellows Hall is great.  It is tucked away in a quiet location but right in the heart of downtown Ballard. We were able to walk everywhere on our trip easily.  The apartment itself is spacious and clean.  We would happily stay again on future trips  We felt welcomed even before we arrived. The apartment was perfect as was the area. We have visited Seattle several times and wanted to stay and explore places outside of the downtown area. The Odd Fellows Lodge and Ballard were just what we were looking for.   We had a great stay at Ballard Odd Lodging! We stayed Wed-Fri and had no trouble with nearby street parking. Close to restaurants, bars, great coffee (Bauhaus), and walking distance to places to see great shows (Tractor, Sunset Tavern).  We had a wonderful stay at the Odd Lodging. The neighborhood was great, the accomodations were spacious and our host was helpful. Highly recommended. Great visit! Everything about it was easy - the checkin, the location just a few blocks from everything we wanted to do. It was clean and very quiet and private. The perfect stay! We had a great stay here! Super cute, clean place, right in the heart of Ballard. Would definitely stay again :) We loved staying in this apartment! It was so nicely kept, clean, and had a really nice feel. I felt kind of sad to leave! Great location close to awesome pubs, restaurants, and shops. I would stay there again in a heart beat!:) A very unique space. We were very comfortable and had a great time at the Odd Fellows Lodge. Would definitely stay again. Great quite residence! We really enjoyed our stay,  we were able to walk wherever to get where we wanted to be.  Any questions we had,  the answer was simply a text away! This place was top notch. We were gobsmacked by the size of it--bedroom, living room, kitchen and bathroom. Lots of space to spread out and get comfy. The location was great--so close to lots of interesting places to drink and eat, including a wonderful coffee shop and an amazing whiskey bar. And just a short drive from downtown. It honestly couldn\\'t have been more perfect for our brief stay in Seattle, and it made us wish we were staying longer. The Odd Lodging was awesome! It\\'s location in the heart of Ballard is unbelievable. Communication was easy, and they were super-accomodating. We had a flight out of Seattle late on our check-out day. Since the didn\\'t have guests coming in that day, they let us keep our things there a few extra hours. The place is spacious, comfortable, and the outdoor hallway/nook is a great place to hang out. We would definitely stay there again if we make it back to Seattle! Ballard Odd Fellows was a great place to stay while in Seattle. The location is perfect, as Ballard is a beautiful and historic neighborhood close to the harbor that offers excellent options for food and drink and access to multiple bus lines that bring a visitor to all parts of Seattle, including multiple express bus lines to downtown Seattle and the train station should you be traveling via the rail. The apartment is great, exactly as it appears in the pictures. We were more impressed by the size of the apartment and the amenities in the kitchen that allowed us to cook a couple of meals in the apartment. The place was very clean and the furniture and decor was welcoming and comfortable. Also,they have a nice assortment of puzzles and games should you want a break from exploring the city. Nora and Sandy, the main contacts for Ballard Odd Fellows, were responsive in providing the check-in procedure and giving us assistance with regards to where to park our car — we were able to find free street parking just one block north of the apartment. This is an excellent place to stay in Seattle. It\\'s close to Fremont and other great Seattle neighborhoods, with easy access to the waterfront via biking and walking trails and regular buses to downtown Seattle.  It was very comfortable, clean and inviting. A Stellar home away from home! This was our 2nd visit (and hopefully the 2nd of many, many more visits). We think of this sweet quiet apartment as our Ballard Oasis. Between the multitude of parties and events to attend, it is a treat to retire in the comfortable space and chill out. We love the fact that we can walk to so many restaurants and bars! Thank you again and can\\'t wait to be back soon! Tracy and \\r\\nBob The Odd Fellows Lodge had everything we needed for a couple days in Seattle. Comfortable, spacious apartment. Good location. Easy check in and out. Would definitely visit again. We loved our stay in Ballard at the Odd Fellows Lodge. The apartment was just as described and the hosts were quick to respond and very accommodating. I would highly recommend this apartment for anyone wanting a great place to stay in Ballard with a very easy bus commute to downtown Seattle.  The Odd Fellows was a great little gem. Situated a stones throw from all the great bars and restaurants, including access to buses in every direction (especially handy is the express bus to downtown), it was a perfect location. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment is huge! As well as the comfortable bed, it has a well stocked kitchen and lounge area - a totally spacious stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nNora was lovely and friendly in her communications. Besides an early miscommunication hitch and some initial confusion, the stay at Odd Fellows is totally recommended! This place was great! \\r\\n\\r\\nWe arrived really lately, some time after midnight due to my phones navigation taking me 3 hours the wrong way, I know I know, my own fault. Anyway they were able to arrange me a key at that late hour which I am incredibly grateful. We spent very little time in the place as there is so much to do around it. The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was an awesome claw foot tub with a shower head added.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were able to explain parking to me, and answered more than one annoying question I had. I couldn\\'t have asked for anything better.  We had a great time in Seattle and a wonderful stay at the Odd Lodging. Next to the bedroom (with a very comfy bed), there was also a full kitchen and a living room with some provided boardgames and books. Everything was nicely decorated, clean and we felt very safe. It\\'s a nice neighbourhood with many cafes, restaurants and shops and the bus connections to Downtown are good (about 15min to the Pike Market).\\nEven when we had an emergency (the apartment lock malfunctioned at 1am), our hosts reacted swiftly, organized a locksmith and even gave us a beer and a tour through their lodge to kill time. They made an otherwise unpleasant experience very interesting, which is highly appreciated. \\nGreat hosts and a great apartment, we would definitely recommend! The Odd Lodging apartment was quaint & cute, clean, and simple. The apartment was very easy to find, and the self check-in/ check-out was nice. The team of hosts at Odd Lodging were helpful and responsive when messaging for how to enter/ exit, and anything we needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment was simple, bedroom, living/ dining room, kitchen and bathroom. The living/ dining room was a nice little space to sit and relax, and play a game of cards (cards, and a few games were found in the apartment). My girlfriend and I stayed only two days, but I found the apartment was plenty spacious, minus the bathroom was quite small. The secure gate leading to the apartment was nice too, that area was very welcoming and nice to leave dirty shoes (not wanting to dirty the apartment) from our hiking outside of Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area of the apartment was great, with a Walgreens a block away for any last minute items needed, and lots of great bars and restaurants within a 10 minute walk. Also, if in Ballard on a Sunday, the Ballard Farmer\\'s Market was easy and fun to walk to and around. The Odd Fellows\\' space is quite nice. Accessible location in Ballard. While not in a bad neighborhood, the combination of the late-night 7/11 crowd across the street and the alley access to the apartment can make for an uncomfortable walk, safety-wise. Host was so easy to communicate with -  from leading up to our stay, to day of coordination, to wrapping up time at Odd Lodging, it was seamless.  The location is so ideal, you can walk right to the heart of Ballard and you are close enough to the Ballard Bridge as well as access to 99 to get Queen Anne and downtown.  Would highly recommend. Great location and very spacious with lots of good places to eat and drink nearby. We enjoyed seeing live music in a couple of different venues in Ballard. If we come to Seattle again we\\'d definitely stay here!  For the price and location this place is a steal.  Easy check in, place was clean, it is fully stocked with anything you could need, its a good size, and there is a organic donut place across the street.  It is in a commercial district which actually made it very quiet at night.  There is a ton of things to walk to.  We found street parking to be pretty easy, and the lot was cheap also.  It is a basement apt so it was a little on the dark side but not bad.  We were out and about a lot so really just a place to sleep.  The shower was a bit old but it did work and have hot water.  The bed was a bit hard - a $50 memory foam pad would go a long way to making it more comfortable.  Overall based on location and price I would recommend it. The apartment was spacious and had everything that we needed. The neighborhood is nice with many small restaurants and shops. However, be careful not to leave anything in your car when parking in the Ballard area. Our car was broken into on the last day and all our luggage got stolen, since we were just about to leave to the airport. Great location, spacious apartment! We\\'d definitely stay there again! We had a wonderful stay! The apartment is located in an awesome area of Ballard with lots of restaurants and shops nearby. It\\'s only a short ride to other neighborhoods in Seattle as well which  made things very convenient for us. The apartment itself was really nice and clean and looked exactly as pictured. The host Nora was also easy to reach and very accommodating. We would definitely recommend choosing this for your stay! Thank you!  Great lodging in a fun, convenient area.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stayed at Odd Lodging for 5 nights while we were in Seattle and it made a great home base. The place is located on a hot stretch of Ballard, within walking distance to many great restaurants, bars, and breweries. It\\'s also right off of two bus lines with a store nearby selling passes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place itself was great; plenty large for two people. The bed was comfortable and it was stocked with books and games should you have some free time to kill. There\\'s a full kitchen with everything you might need to eat in and menus on the outside pinboard should you want to venture out. The place was immaculate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI interacted with Nora dung my stay and she was very friendly and helpful. Even warning us when there were significant traffic delays expected. The location is great and the accommodations get the job done. There is so much within walking distance. The hosts were very accessible and helpful. The kitchen is well stocked but you may want to bring some spices and such if you want to cook. FYI, It can be a little dark and musty and the alley can attract some loiterers. But definitely would stay there again. This is a the best Ballard gem. Very homey feeling, comfy bed, clean space, and very secure. Easy to find with good free asking options. Close to some of Seattle\\'s hottest restaurant. Good communication with the host always. This is the second time I\\'ve booked this space and will most definitely book again. Thank you to the IOOF all your support of my growing business. The host was fantastic and was easy to communicate and work with. The place was cool,clean and fun. A great urban hideaway in Ballard. Great place to stay in the heart of ballard for an unbeatable price. Place feels very homey considering it is essentially the basement of their building accessed by the alleyway. Big metal gate makes the place feel real secure. Space heaters were provided, which were useful.  Odd Lodging was fantastic on many levels, before I begin to describe our stay, I would like to let anyone who plans on renting this place  that it is right in the heart of everything going on in Ballard.  It is awesome! You can walk anywhere, bars, restaurants, yoga, shopping, coffee and there is a great bike rental place called Dutch Bike (I think) and ride around instead of walking.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo...the place looked exactly like the photos and it seems like kind of a weird place because its behind a commercial building (strip mall-ish) and you have to unlock a chain link gate to get in, however, once inside you will find yourself in mid-century heaven:)  This place is so stinking cute, with great colors and a very bohemian \"Mad Men\" like feeling.  The bed was incredibly comfortable and they have a perfect little vanity next to it to get ready and head into Seattle for some more fun. The kitchen is so sweet, kind of wished that there were 40\\'s-50\\'s style appliances but nonetheless it was fantastic.  They have dishes, towels, paper towels etc...handy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were always available to me, they made it incredibly easy for me to get the key and we were in quite late the first night.  They got back to me quickly if I had any questions regarding parking or something to do with the apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one thing I would say could be a little better is the parking situation.  There really isn\\'t anywhere to park that you can park overnight and for free.  We had to change our parking spot a bunch of times and that kind of got old, but in no way took away from how great this place is to stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo....in other words, we loved it.  It is funky, clean, cool and the energy felt very warm.   It was very clean and inviting. Wonderful location close to food and night life. Would definitely come back! Oddfellows was super easy - great location for Ballard/Fremont exploring. Good bed and good amount of space to relax in. Pro tip - Mighty O donuts just opened nearby, I\\'d never had a vegan donut but they are delicious! Great experience staying at the \"Odd Lodging\". The apartment is comfortable and very conveniently located. Super easy communication. Loved this little place! Clean and comfortable. Amazing location! The odd lodging was charming and the host was very responsive.  The location in Ballard was awesome. The house was perfect!  I felt really comfortable staying here.  Ballard is a really beautiful place and I would definitely consider staying here again in a future visit to Seattle.  Great apartment in a great neighborhood. The hosts communicated well, nice amenities. Easy to walk to a grocery store and numerous restaurants. If you\\'re around on a Sunday check out the Ballard Farmer\\'s Market! I had a extremely comfortable and restful three nights here. I felt very welcomed, the room was immaculate and very comfortable and I was given all the information that I needed. The location is quiet, perfect for exploring Ballard and downtown Seattle is only a short journey away. Kaiser and Heather made us feel so welcome staying with them in Ballard, and definitely went above and beyond to make us comfortable! Kaiser was full of tips and local recommendations, and the extra touches really made our stay great. Thanks so much Kaiser and Heather! We had such a great experience with Kaiser we ended up extending our stay. Thanks for making us feel so at home!  Kaiser was on top of communicating with me, timely and concise, since our differing schedules meant most likely we wouldn\\'t actually see each other. The bedroom is on 1st floor of 3 story residence, with separate, private bath down the hall. Very private and quiet. This was single night stay with an early morning departure, chosen because I had 8 am class at adjacent Fishermens Terminal, followed by my departure from Seattle. I know this neighborhood well and it is a walker\\'s dream with close access to all Central Ballard has to offer. Bed was comfortable, shower\\'s water pressure excellent-all was clean and comfortable. A definite recommend! Kaiser and his family are very welcoming and have a beautiful home. The area accommodates for pretty much any need you would have. Would strongly recommend. My stay at Kaiser\\'s home was perfect for my needs. He was very prompt and clear in responding to all of my questions related to checking in and the neighborhood. The room is quite comfortable, very clean and very nicely furnished with a private bath just down the hall. I loved the privacy of the first floor accommodations so I could come and go without bothering my hosts. The street parking was easy and the neighborhood is quiet and very safe feeling to walk around even late at night. His location is very convenient for exploring the wonderful Ballard restaurants, Sunday farmers market and coffee shops by foot. I would definitely recommend a stay at Kaiser\\'s beautiful home.  Kaiser and his family are great! The place is about a 10 minute walk to the busy parts of Ballard and a two minute walk to the bus. The bus system in Seattle is amazingly easy to navigate. The room is a bit small, but everything was impeccably clean and the hospitality was top notch. Also, the bed was so soft and comfortable. You get what\\'s advertised, and Kaiser and his wife go above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable.  Kaiser\\'s home is conveniently located to shops, coffee, restaurants, bars, etc...  The house was clean and comfortable.  The floor plan is perfect because guests have the street level floor and Kaiser and his family live upstairs so there was a sense of privacy.  Thank you for a lovely stay, I hope to come again!\\r\\nLisa\\r\\n This truly is the \"Perfect Room\" in the Heart of Ballard. Description and directions were all perfect. Bathrobes and snacks were all perfect. Now, I can\\'t say the bed was perfect because IT WAS BEYOND PERFECT! Truly, we have never slept in anything so comfortable. Better than even the nicest hotel I\\'ve stayed in. Kaiser & Heather have really created the perfect, cozy room for those wanting to explore all that Ballard has to offer.  Kaiser was very attentive from the time I made the reservation. The room was spotlessly clean, as was the bathroom down the hallway. I especially appreciated the hotel-quality bathrobe in the closet - a very welcome touch! You have your own floor for a good amount of privacy. Location is Ballard is great and walkable to everything. An excellent Airbnb experience. Kaiser was very welcoming and made sure we were comfortable the secod we were at his doorstep. The accomdations/amenities were exceptional and the aurrounding area had plenty to do. Highly recommend staying here if you have the chance! I have nothing but positive things to say about our stay with Kaiser. The check in/check out process was a breeze, the place was impeccably clean and organized, and Kaiser had tons of great suggestions on things to do while in Seattle. We really enjoyed being able to come and go as we please and having our own bathroom. Oh and the location is absolutely perfect-5 minute walk to everything that Ballard has to offer. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! The room was exactly as it is described and was very cozy for the days we were there. Kaiser made sure we were comfortable when we got there and as our stay continued, emailing me since we were out of the house a lot of the time. When we did meet, he was very nice and made sure that everything was working for us and that we were enjoying our stay in Seattle, including recommending some places to see since we were house hunting. Would definitely stay again and would recommend staying here! Kai was great! He made my parents feel at home and everything was perfect. Thanks!! My hosts made me feel so very welcome! The room is wonderful, the neighborhood is quiet, and and the private bathroom is comfortable (with a GREAT shower to boot!). They had left a welcome basket on the nightstand with goodies, and their check-in instructions were perfect! A seamless experience from beginning to end, and a VERY convenient location - close to everything! Kaiser\\'s place was great! It was easy to get to, and the Ballard neighborhood is beautiful. The room was clean and very inviting. It is on the bottom floor, with its own bathroom, so it was very private which was nice after a long day of exploring. We would definitely stay here again!  Excellent experience staying with Kaiser. The accommodations were clean and beautiful. Comfortable bed and bathroom. Super easy coordinating with Kaiser and getting checked in. Excellent location in Ballard, walking distance to all of the neighborhoods bars and restaurants, etc. Highly recommend staying here. This is a very nice room for a stay in Ballard.  I did not meet my hosts, but communication with them via txt and email was great, so everything went smoothly and I felt welcome.  I parked my car near the room and visited friends in Ballard on foot.  The location is really convenient to the shops and amenities of the area, but I was delighted to find on my walk back at night that the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful.  A great stay. Great location, nice host, very welcoming room that matched the description.  A good stay. Listing description was super accurate. Bedroom and bathroom on the lower floor, you have it completely to yourself. Super close to everything Ballard and we walked everywhere. They leave a really excellent list of must-sees within walking distance which was much appreciated, and they really went out of their way to make our stay special, from bedside snacks and water to personal touches based on why we were in town. They were also really fast to respond to messages when we had questions. Would absolutely recommend! Enjoyed the experience very much.  The room and bath were exceptionally comfortable and clean.  Appreciated the amenities provided and extra touch.  Location was awesome and convenient for my coming and going.  Looking forward to a visit in the Fall and will check here first hoping this room is available.  Thank you! We had a great trip, the location was how it was described with great walking access to Coffee, Dinner and the Water. Very clean and plenty of privacy to come and go. Met our hosts briefly very nice, ended coming back 3 nights latter for another night. Great host. Responsive and bed / bathroom was über clean. Was a tad warm at night without AC the bed was comfortable and TV with numerous channels was great! Also, a great area to bed! Overall would recommend to anyone!!! This listing was exactly what I wanted and needed. Apart from just being in an excellent location, Kaiser\\'s room was incredibly welcoming. A basket with snacks, water, and tips for the area made it even more so! I never met Kaiser in person, but I was truly grateful for the privacy I was granted in his home. I didn\\'t feel like I was renting a space surrounded by others.. It was like I had my own place. A real hotel experience. The room was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. The goody basket was quite thoughtful and the bathroom soaps, shampoos and lotions were high quality and smelled nice! The house was very easy to get in and out of. The bed takes up most of the room, but it didn\\'t matter, since we were exploring all day! Fantastic location and neighborhood. The hosts were very easy to communicate with. We were grateful there was a fan we propped on the window, since it was super hot in Seattle this weekend!  We had a great night in Kaiser\\'s room. It is very clean and cozy and really neat. Everything you need is there... From shampoo to travel guide:)\\nCommunication was great as well. \\nWe really liked the neighborhood, too!\\nI can really recommend this place!! Easy going hosts and the perfect space for a comfy stay in a fantastic neighborhood.  We had a great stay in Ballard!  I used to live in Ballard a few years ago, and I loved this neighborhood.  The room was cozy, and everything was super clean.  We had everything we needed, and all the cool coffee shops, Ballard Locks, and breweries/bars were just steps away.  The Ballard Seafood Fest was in full force when we arrived, and we enjoyed some great food and beer!  Downtown Seattle, Greenlake Park, Gasworks Park, and Pike Place Market are also pretty quick drives if you’re planning an extensive tour of the city.  We met Heather very briefly one day, who was extremely nice and helpful.  The only thing I noticed on the amenities list was the availability of a washer/dryer.  When we arrived at the room, there was a packet of information stating these items wouldn’t be available.  It wasn’t a huge deal for us at all, but for someone needing a washer/dryer during their stay it could be confusing.  Also, the front entrance was not entirely private, since we could hear someone going in and out of the residence in the mornings.  I’m not sure if the residence had a back entrance, but just be aware that someone may come in or out at times.  Overall, this was a really great location, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone I knew traveling to the area! Kaiser and Heather were excellent hosts! I highly recommend this stay for anybody visiting the Seattle area. It is in a great location, private, clean and comfortable. Our hosts even brought us breakfast and a birthday card. Very thoughtful!  This accomodation was very well situated for our purposes in that we could arrive late at night with luggage and walk to the from the ORCA bus - less than a block from stop. \\r\\nThe small room on first floor was clean as advertised and just down the corridor was a spotlessly clean private bathroom.  Our host provided us with croissants for breakfast one morning which was appreciated.\\r\\nWe also liked the location in general in that it was well located with a grocery store just up the street and the main Ballard commercial district with restaurants, bars, shops etc a short walk away.  \\r\\n The listing was accurate, room was clean, and host was easy to reach electronically. They replenished us with water upon request, and the bedside had snacks, while not the Kind bars depicted in the listing. The bedroom door does not lock and you can hear people going in and out of the front door right next to it.  We were too warm to sleep during the hottest days of Seattle in the small room at night, but they provided us with a fan. \\r\\nWe never got to meet the host who live in the same townhouse, whose visiting family and a small child awoke us early in the morning. They offered us coffee and croissant to make up for it, but I do not have breakfast in bed and already have had a fair share of croissants.\\r\\nBallard is a great neighborhood and their location is extremely convenient. Kaiser and his family were very welcoming. My wife and I were able to park on the street in front of the place, which was very convenient. Most of the room is taken up by the bed, which made it tricky to get things out of our large suitcases; the room would be better for those with smaller bags. We chose the place based on its proximity to the Ballard Locks, and it was very convenient to be able to walk there. We really loved this room and the location!  The room and the bathroom were very nice and worked perfectly for the two of us.  Parking can be a little tough but we were never more than 3-4 blocks from the home.  Lots of great shops, food and coffee within walking distance. My husband and I were very content with the accommodations. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Kaiser and Heather  knew we were going to be in late from our flight, and kindly gave us a free gift certificate for their favorite morning coffee shop...and where it was located in the note. Heather was very helpful once we had already arrived and gave additional advise and solutions to issues that faced us, first in person, and the rest of the time by texting. We had total privacy. It is nicely located within walking distance to historic Ballard and on the bus routes. Parking is crazy in Seattle, but we found parking spaces within a block every time. We would stay again when we go visit our daughter and son-in-law.    This was an ideal place to stay for the first couple of nights we spent in Seattle. The room was very clean and professionally maintained, like you\\'d expect from a hotel. We were given a nice gift basket and some info about the neighborhood. The bathroom was also spotlessly clean, private, and convenient. We enjoyed being so close to the bars, restaurants and shops in Ballard - the neighborhood was really charming. Nights in the bedroom got a little too hot with the window closed, but after I opened it the temperature evened out pretty well. We appreciated having a clean, well-maintained, and very private location for such an affordable price. Thanks guys! Kaiser and Heather were so thoughtful. I didn\\'t get a chance to meet them, but they made us feel so welcomed by leaving us a gift card to their favorite coffee shop, a basket of snacks, and water bottles. Kasier was very responsive and and made it easy to get our key. We enjoyed having a private bathroom that was very clean. We also thought the location was perfect, walking distance to anywhere in Ballard. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe highly recommend this place and would love to stay here again when we are in Seattle.  Our stay with Kaiser and Heather was wonderful! The house is centrally located within Ballard and was very walkable to many bars and restaurants.\\n\\nWe would absolutely stay here again! Kaiser and Heather were absolutely amazing! We arrived Thursday morning and they had no problem with us checking-in early. The accommodations were very well kept. We did have the same entrance, but we didn\\'t have too much contact with them throughout our stay. They were very helpful in offering us things to do in the area. The location was great - within walking distance of numerous shops and restaurants. We would definitely stay with them again! We adored the neighborhood of Ballard, and Kaiser\\'s room was in a perfect location for walking around the area. The room was so comfortable (that bed was divine), the bathroom was spotless, and we appreciated the snacks, water, and guide to the area our hosts left in the area. The bed takes up most of the room, so it\\'s a bit of a tight fit with luggage and such, but we expected that, and it was not a problem. There is a closet with hangers and we found that storage to be perfect. We wanted a clean, well-kept place to sleep and leave our things while we explored Ballard and the rest of Seattle, and we found it in this room. We would absolutely stay here again!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks, Kaiser and Heather! What a great find! Ballard has a cool community vibe with lots of nice restaurants and bars. The Farmers Market on Sunday was a highlight.   \\r\\n\\r\\nKaiser\\'s private room was perfect. Everything about the rental was good but it was the little touches that made all the difference: gift basket filled with snacks, a $10 gift card for the neighbourhood coffee shop and the softest bedsheets on the planet! \\r\\nThe Townhouse is also perfectly situated on a quiet street just 5 minutes walk from the main hub.  \\r\\nWe rarely heard from the hosts (who live upstairs) and only saw them once so our ground floor bedroom and bathroom felt very private. We will definitely be staying here again. Everything was perfect. Kaiser and Heather made sure I had all the information I needed before my arrival and also made sure that my late arrival was not a problem. The area is great and I felt safe travelling alone. The room has all I needed and I was welcomed with a personal note, snacks, water. Although we didn\\'t meet in person they checked online with me if I had everything I needed. I would stay here again immediately. Thank you! Fantastic restful place. Clean. Considerate hosts. A very convenient arrangement. Short walk to heart of Ballard. Great experience - 5 star treatment!  Bed was super comfortable (although it pretty much fills up the entire room).  Listing and pictures are accurate.   Very nice place. Exceptionally clean. Lots of nice small touches such as a detailed welcome guide and a small basket of snacks and bottled water. Lots of nice cafes, bars and restaurants close by. The room was perfect for me, but might be a little compact for two people with a lot of luggage. Nice area as well. This was a Super Comfortable place.  The Bed was more comfortable than my bed at home. I slept great and really appreciated all the snacks the owners had left for me.  They have thought of everything to make this a perfect place to stay.  It\\'s also very convenient and I walked everywhere I needed to go.  I really enjoyed my second stay at Kaiser and Heather\\'s home. For me they offer a perfect combination of a very comfortable, clean and well appointed accommodation located in a safe and walkable neighborhood with the added convenience of nearby coffee shops, market and restaurants in a central Ballard location. I especially like their home\\'s floor plan which has their guest room and bathroom located on the entry level. It offers privacy while allowing me to come and go early morning and late evening without disturbing my hosts. Kaiser was very prompt and complete in his communication with me and I appreciate the thoughtful amenities they provide with robes, snacks and fast Wi-Fi. It is a pleasure to stay here. Everything was great. Perfect spot from which to explore Ballard, comfy bed, and thoughtful touches in the room (such as snacks).  This was our first Airbnb experience. Kaiser really helped demystify the process with his excellent and timely communications with us. He was always friendly and approachable. We were afforded great privacy.\\r\\nThe room was indeed cozy. There were thoughtful touches that let you know you were welcome and appreciated. The snacks and maps were so awesome. This family clearly enjoys making their space warm and inviting to their guests. I could really feel the love that they put into this. All amenities were just as promised in the listing- a very comfortable bed, nice linens. We felt relaxed and safe.\\r\\nThe location was amazing. The Ballard business district was easily accessible by foot yet the home is tucked away on a quiet residential street. Superb coffee is just over a block away. The bus to downtown Seattle was nearby. We felt lucky to have landed in this particular location. \\r\\nWe had a great stay and all our needs were met.  Great quiet stay in Ballard. Kaiser and Heather were very thoughtful hosts. I appreciated the snacks and coffee!\\nExtremely convenient location and uber comfy bed!! Thanks for the escape! Kaiser\\'s place was perfect for us. Kaiser was very friendly and thoughtful. We had a holiday party on Ballard ave so the location was great. The bed was comfortable. We would love to stay here again in the future. Thank you, Kaiser!  We had a great time, the apartment was clean and comfortable, in a pretty neighborhood, entry and exit went without a hitch. Yoav checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed. Thanks! Very nice home and great neighborhood!  It was perfect for our family trip.  The home was clean and fit our needs for the 4 of us perfectly.  Yoav was very communicative throughout which was much appreciated.  They gave great recommendations on things to do nearby, especially indoor activities when we experienced a rainy day.  We had a great time visiting Seattle. A very cute, cozy apartment in Ballard! A little far away from the main action of the neighborhood, but that also makes it a nice, quiet retreat from the busyness of the city. Easy access to downtown by public transportation was a huge plus. Yoav was great to deal with and even bought an iron/ironing board when we inquired about it.  This was a great duplex in Ballard. There was one small bedroom, a living room with a sofa/futon that pulled out to a bed, and a small dining table (two chairs), a nice kitchen, and a good bathroom. Our family of four (two adults and two young children) stayed there in August for four days and it was a good size for us. We had a car with us, and street parking was easy to come by.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was in excellent condition and clean. In the bedroom, the hosts left space for us to unpack into closets and shelves. There were dry supplies (e.g. pasta) in the kitchen, though we brought our own food and mostly ate out. The wifi worked well. We didn\\'t turn on the TV, but there was one in the living room. There was coin-operated laundry available on-site. I believe it was $1.25 to wash and $1.50 to dry. Detergent was available in the laundry room. We did one load and had no problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hosts were extremely organized, thorough and accommodating. When we said we\\'d be arriving quite late, they went ahead and set up the sofa bed for us. Given the fact we had sleepy kids with us, this was really a boon as we could go straight to bed upon arrival from the east coast. They also provided very detailed information about the house, how to check out, and a map of Ballard. Checking in was also very easy!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have no complaints whatsoever about this experience; indeed it was better than at least our last three hotel stays! This was my first time using air b&b and I can only hope that additional experiences are so positive. Great location, clean and easy to manage (plenty of parking, key on-site, towels, and basic necessities, etc). Hosts were very responsive and friendly, made sure we were settled in. The apartment is a full-time AirBNB unit.   We enjoyed our stay and look forward to another opportunity to visit Ballard and the great location of this home. We stayed here for a wedding in Ballard-parking was good - close to stores and restaurants. Nice space for 2 people.  We would stay here again  We had a very comfortable stay at Maya & Yoav\\'s flat. The neighbourhood was great and Yoav was very responsive to questions and requests, including providing a crib with linens for our baby. We would definitely stay again. I booked this flat for my family to stay at over labor day weekend. It is within walking distance from my condo- great location in Ballard near downtown, grocery store, coffee shops, restaurants, etc. Yoav & Maya were very welcoming and easy to deal with- even offering to set up the futon for us prior to our arrival. The flat was clean, cute and cozy. Sleeping accommodations were a bit tight for 4 people but perfect for 2 or 3. I would book this flat again for future visits! It was such a pleasure to walk into the unit and find a bottle of wine on the table next to the property instructions.  Thank you!   Maya and Yoav\\'s flat was such a great place to stay. The place was clean, cozy, and in a wonderful neighborhood. It was nice being outside of downtown but still being highly accessible. It only takes about 10-15 minutes to get to the heart of the city. The town of Ballard was such a nice surprise to us. We ended up spending most of our time there. The shops, restaurants, and breweries were all within a short drive/walk.  Maya and Yoav were awesome hosts. They left instructions on how to explore the area and about all the cool things to do in Seattle. The house was perfect, included laundry and dishwasher. Everything was very clean and comfortable. The area is very quiet and we slept well every night. This place was great. Cute little house in a nice neighborhood in Ballard. I was left some welcoming libations by maya and yoav. Thank you.  Great stay, great hosts. This was our first experience with Airbnb. Maya and Yoav were responsive, wonderful hosts. The house was cute and comfortable. The location was perfect for us, we felt a part of the neighborhood immediately. It was within walking distance to everything we required. We thank Yoav and Maya for all their attention to detail and for welcoming us into Airbnb.  We will be back!   We had a great experience renting from Maya and Yoav. The flat location allowed for easy access to the area. The flat itself was kept and furnished well. There was even a welcome gift waiting for us. This was a great weekend stay and more than affordable. Thanks for the great accommodations and flexibility with our checkout time. \\n\\n- Clint The flat was comfortable and a good place to stay.  My husband and I enjoyed walking to nearby coffee and eateries ( we LOVED Bitterroot BBQ), as well as being a very short drive to other places.  It was great to be able to have the comforts of home (roomy shower, coffee maker, etc) while away.  We found a great map with descriptions of places to eat and drink, which was a very helpful starting place for exploring the area.  \\r\\nOne thing that I will note: in the morning for a few short minutes it is easy to hear the neighbors leaving for work.  This did not impact us too much as we fell right back to sleep, but it was noticeable.  We didn\\'t hear them anywhere else in the house, or any other time of the day, though. Maya and Yoav\\'s flat was fantastic for our stay: it\\'s nicely located in an adorable neighborhood, walking distance to a ton of restaurants, bars and shops in Ballard. It was clean and safe and adorably set up for our visit, and they were accessible to answer any questions that arose while we were in town (or offer good local restaurant recommendations!). Definitely recommend staying here on your trip to Seattle! Such a perfect, cute apartment for my quick trip to Seattle. The apartment was clean, and everything worked smoothly from the wifi, to the tv to having a hot shower each morning! Loved the location and extra touches Maya and Yoav put in to make it special. Thanks!  This was a perfect little place for our family of four!  Cozy and quaint with everything we could need between a full kitchen to comfy beds and even a tub for our little ones to end their busy days in.  We felt very welcomed by Yoav and his polite and friendly boys who came by personally to gift us a bottle of wine (Yum!) and a few sweet treats for the kiddos!  Highly recommended and we wouldn\\'t hesitate to return.  Thank you! Maya and Yoav were wonderful hosts who were extremely accommodating. The flat was clean, comfortable and very cute, plus the location was perfect for my visit. Looking forward to coming back to Seattle and booking this flat again. First of all, it\\'s red! How can you NOT love it? The cheery color was perfect in the gloomy weather. The inside was cozy and warm, a nice place to put our feet up and relax after a long day of walking around in the rain. It\\'s only a couple of blocks to Ballard Market, an amazing local grocery story open 24/7 chock full of good stuff. We didn\\'t have a car, so we alternated walking and Ubering to all the bars and restaurants in the Old Ballard area, depending on how cold it was or how tired we were. Maya and Yoav also recommended Morsel for breakfast, which is only a few blocks away and had delicious biscuits. There were also some great breweries within walking distance. Overall we really enjoyed our stay. We never actually met Maya and Yoav but they communicated with us before and during our stay so that we had everything we needed.  Maya and Yoav\\'s flat is just great!  It was easy to get to, easy check in, and the laundry room was appreciated.  Ballard is one of my favorite neighborhoods, and this was a great location to experience it. The house was cozy and close to everything that Ballard had to offer. It met my needs perfectly.  Yoav was a good communicator and we had no issues finding and getting into the house. The description was accurate. The location is great. We walked to Ballard Market for coffee, and Veraci Pizza among others. We had four people and the unit felt a bit tight, but worked fine for us since we were out and about during the days and really only sleeping there. House was close to many Ballard and Fremont neighborhood restuarnts and breweries.  Easy to find and plenty of parking. I was looking for a place to hide and get some work done on my laptop, and I wanted to be able to do fun stuff in the evenings.  Sweet North Central Flat checked all the boxes! Private, comfy, all the amenities you need to be happy, and a 15 minute stroll to Ballard Ave\\'s bars and music and restaurants. Trader Joe\\'s just down the road too.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaya & Yoav couldn\\'t have been any more helpful; there was even a bottle of wine waiting for me upon arrival! This was a great little working retreat for me. Thanks!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Maya and Yoav were super friendly and attentive to our stay! They checked in with us, and made sure we were comfortable and happy with everything. There place is super cute, quiet, and in a great location! 2 minutes from a great market and walking distance to great restaurants, bars, and cute shops. Shanon was away when I was there, but was a very gracious host. She left me some information on the neighborhood, a bag of coffee for my arrival, and messaged me to ensure everything was all right. The room was great; quiet and clean, and the location is well-situated between Ballard and Freemont neighborhoods. Would definitely stay there again! Great place, fantastic location and Shannon was an excellent host.  Wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay with her again or recommend her to others Very nice, accommodating, and easy to navigate around Ballard from this location. I had to cancel my stay unexpectedly at the last minute due to a personal semi emergent situation and Shannon was very understanding, did not charge me-  I look forward to staying with her sometime soon! Shannon is a worthy host and she interacts with you in a very effective way.  Her place is nice too and the view is lovely.  It is comfortable like a sublet, or like you just happen to live in this place for a short time.   Lovely room in a great location. Shannon was a fantastic host, giving me suggestions as to what to do and lending me guide books. She even stayed up to meet me when my flight was delayed. An all round brilliant experience.  Shannon was wonderful and her house was a comfortable and cozy place where to rest. Shannon is super nice and attentive. A great place! I stayed at Shannon\\'s place for a weekend after a work trip in Seattle. Coincidentally, she had to be out of town when I was staying, so it was just me having the place to myself. Shannon was very considerate and communicative while handing off the keys, and giving me great tips on places around the neighborhood. She has a very useful tip sheet as well, which she\\'ll email you if you stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer place is great and exactly what I needed for a relaxing weekend. If you like walking, this is a great location about less than 20 mins one way to Ballard or Fremont. Easy to Uber in and out of, and there\\'s a bus route close by, which I didn\\'t use. There are hills around the area, which is something to consider if your not into that sort of thing. I didn\\'t drive, but there seemed to be lots of street parking available. \\r\\n\\r\\nHer place was cozy and comfortable, and Shannon is a warm and considerate person. I\\'d recommend it to my friends. Shannon was a great host and provided plenty of options for things to do while in Seattle. The room was quiet, clean and overall very comfortable.  Shannon was an amazing host! Her house is situated in a really cute neighborhood with convenient transportation nearby. Ballard is a great part of Seattle to explore, and the views are incredible. Shannon went out of her way to make me feel at home and help me find my way around the city. These types of experiences are what I love about AirBnB! Shannon was great, and staying with her was great, too! The room is as described--neat, in a lovely home, and in a neighborhood near lots of great food and drinking, with easy bus access downtown if you need it, too. \\r\\n\\r\\nShannon made me feel totally welcome, and if I\\'m in Seattle again anytime soon I would absolutely stay here again.  Although Shannon wasn\\'t there to greet me in person on the first day, I felt as though she was there to make me feel right at home. I arrived when she had left for a trip, which was no problem for me at all, and I got into the house just fine and got accustomed just fine. First off, I really love the house. It\\'s really cute and also had a great location! Everything about the home fit the description. Shannon also checked up on me to make sure I was doing alright, which I really appreciated. She seems really friendly and down to earth! I would love to go back to her home if I go on another trip to Seattle! I enjoyed my stay in Shannon\\'s. The apartment is in a nice quiet neighborhood  in Ballard. The room has a comfortable bed and the shared bathroom is next door to the room providing easy access. Shannon was quite welcoming and easy going. She even gave me a lift at the end of my stay, which was very considerate. There is access to a washing machine and dryer - this was also a plus since I ended up using the facilities in the middle of my stay. Shannon went out of her way to wait for me since I was caught in traffic, but when she needed to leave, she was up front and communicative. And when I needed privacy, she didn\\'t bother me at all!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location was great and the neighborhood was nice and quiet even though it seemed like we were on a big street. My room was in the back so I couldn\\'t hear anything. I could walk down to Leary Way and had breakfast at The Dish cafe or dinner at Tray Kitchen (lots of fun - I recommend it!), and parking was plentiful and easy too.\\r\\n\\r\\nShannon\\'s place was clean and neat, and even though the bed was a little hard, it was the nice touches like the hangers, lots of shelf space, an extra shelf in the bathroom for my toiletries that made the stay easy. I really felt like I was crashing at a friend\\'s place for a few days while I find a new apartment (which is what I did!). I even said \"See you later!\" at the end of my stay.\\r\\n\\r\\n Shannon is a great host and was able to accommodate me at the last minute. Her place is clean and comfortable.  I had a great time at Shannon\\'s. She was very hospitable and her place was clean, well put together and really close to public transport. It was also only about $10 for an Uber into Downtown Seattle if you\\'re that way inclined!  Shannon was a friendly host. It was easy to get around Seattle from her neighborhood. I absolutely recommend staying at her airbnb! Staying at Shannon\\'s place was ideal. Moving from across the country was hard enough but having a great place to stay with an awesome host made it so much easier. She\\'s really flexible with scheduling and coordinating and most of the time I had the place to myself. Her house is comfortable and the room is perfect for a temporary stay. You\\'re close to everything in Ballard and Fremont, as long as you don\\'t mind walking and the bus is super close to catch to downtown. Definitely recommend.  Shannon was very welcoming and accommodating. The apartment is clean and organized, and the location is great.\\r\\nWe had a great weekend in Seattle, thank you! This is a clean, quiet place in a good area close to appealing parts of the city like Wallingford, Greenlake, Fremont and Ballard, and Shannon is very nice. Definitely a good value.  This spot is fantastic: well appointed, great location, private, quiet, spaceous, lovely view, and details like chocolate, toiletries, refreshing beverages.  The baby grand (!) is truly the icing on the cake for me, and hopefully I didn\\'t wear out my welcome on it!  Mimi is a sweet, hospitable, and interesting lady, and a thorough and thoughtful hostess.   Will definitely keep this spot on my radar for future visits! Mimi is a stellar hostess! She personally gave me the tour of her charming and romantic apartment. It is well appointed and even features a full sized piano. Mimi even gave me special accomodations to park my unusually large vehicle. I hope to rent from her again. Very nice, classy apartment with all that I needed to make it a great stay.  Very lovely view from the patio and out the windows from the kitchen and main room.  I only stayed briefly (1 night), but would be happy to return for a longer stay.   I chose Mimi’s place because of the proximity to the Tractor Tavern for a surprise night out of music with my fiancé but the place was way more than I was expecting!  It’s spacious, has an amazing view, charming neighborhood and a huge thing for me – there was a Ballwin grand piano in the apt!  Gorgeous and sounded great.  This is definitely on my list of great place to stay when in the Freemont/Ballard neighborhood.   Mimi was very accommodating and responded quickly to my inquiry, and even tried to offer a discount. The place was absolutely wonderful--very clean, in a lovely location with a good view, and had all the necessary amenities. The deck was great and there was no disturbance from the other tenants, besides some very brief AM construction (but of course there\\'s nothing Mimi could do about that). The grand piano was also a lovely addition, and the apartment\\'s library was full of great books on gardening that we very much enjoyed. \\r\\nOverall, it was a wonderful stay! Thanks Mimi! The house was clean, well situated, exactly as expected and the host was very communicative. Can\\'t ask for anything more, especially when just stopping through town for a short time. Hi,\\r\\nThis was my 1st airbnb experience and it was great.\\r\\nMimi\\'s place was fabulous and so is she.\\r\\nShe has made it very comfortable and easy.\\r\\nThere was even a baby grand piano...wow.\\r\\nThanks Mimi and thanks to airbnb Me and my wife loved our stay with Mimi in Seattle. The location was right between a ton of great neighborhoods like Fremont, Ballard, and Phinney Ridge!  We thought the house was perfectly cozy for us and had no issues getting in or out. Overall a fantastic trip and staying at the airbnb made it so easy and comfortable! Great location! Easy in and out with a door code instead of a key. Clean and well laid out. Lots of good light. This place was in a great location, just a short 10 minute drive into downtown. My wife and I stayed here 2 nights and found the place great.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building seems old but the kitchen, bathroom and floors are modern. The view from the balcony is indeed awesome!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s also walking distance to a Fred Meyers for any groceries you might want.\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly recommend it as a weekend stay while exploring Seattle. My Husband and I stayed in Mimis upstairs Apartment for three nights. \\r\\nUnit is upstairs and has two porches. One garden view , the other roof tops and peak a boo city view. \\r\\nThis place has a relaxed energy about it that we appreciated.\\r\\nNeighbors were Friendly and informative.  Bed was very comfortable !Shower was nice and hot!\\r\\nFull kitchen with every thing you need cook and share a meal together.\\r\\nExtras included Baby grand piano,comfy couch and library of good books and fine art on the walls. \\r\\nMimi was very hospitable and we would recommend this  place to a friend!\\r\\n\\r\\n This place was great!  It is exactly as pictured: cute, clean, and well-decorated.  The couch is comfy and the whole place felt well taken care of.  The cupboards were stocked with everything you\\'d need to cook dinner, though we didn\\'t get to make use of them on our short trip.  There is a piano, and the shelves are lined with interesting books, too!  The back porch was delightful -- we enjoyed a glass of wine there.  The bed was comfortable, there was a fan in the bedroom, and there were plenty of soft towels in the bathroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is perfect, and only a short walk from, say, the Theo Chocolate Factory.  It was easy to find, has off-street parking, and was a quick drive to downtown.  The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn\\'t meet Mimi, though she was responsive to messages, and the place was ready and waiting for us ahead of the posted check-in time.  The pin-code door access and private side entrance meant it was easy to come and go as we pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeads up to anybody with light sensitivity while sleeping -- bring an eye mask if you have one, as there aren\\'t any curtains in the bedroom, though the windows are frosted.  The only other complaint we had was that the drains in the bathroom sink and shower were pretty slow to drain, leaving you standing in a puddle.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall it was a great place to stay, quite affordable, and we\\'d definitely recommend it! My wife and I stayed here for a few days after our wedding, and it was amazing! The apartment is well furnished and clean. It is in a quiet neighborhood, and there is a nice kitchen and deck. We walked to get coffee in the morning and enjoyed it on the deck with a nice view of Ballard. Mimi and Lucas are incredibly friendly and accommodating. I strongly recommend this to anyone that wants to have a relaxed time in a nice non touristy part of Seattle. We had the BEST time! This was a very clean, quiet, relaxing, and pleasant respite in Seattle. We loved the location near Ballard and Fremont. The flat was spacious - more so than we anticipated - and had a nice deck to enjoy the beautiful view. Mimi was a friendly host who warmly greeted us upon arrival and was very quick to respond. If our travels take us back to Seattle in the future, we will definitely consider staying here again.  Mimi was a perfect host! No problems at all and the apartment is so cute and in an awesome location! We enjoyed our stay. Everything was as promised and very comfortable. Mimi got back to us quickly on anything we needed. We think she had a good place going here. The apartment was absolutely perfect.  Cute, quaint, great location and just enough space for us to be comfortable.  We\\'ll most definitely be staying again! We had a great stay at Mimi\\'s. Great location and the place has everything you need. Clean. Thoughtful. Good value  Mimi was very flexible with our odd schedule and was very nice.  The apartment suited our needs and has a great view of the sunset!  Convenient to both Ballard and Fremont, an excellent location. Great stay great location. Thank you very much. My wife and I loved our stay at this apartment. The space was just as described, and the patio had a great view of some other neighborhoods.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also loved that the living room had a grand piano! We actually used it too, when practicing music for a wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nMimi provided a fan and hair dryer upon request (surprisingly, other airbnb hosts have dodged/ignored such requests in the past, so we really appreciated that Mimi was on top of this). \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will definitely look for this place for future stays in Seattle.\\r\\n We stayed at Mimi\\'s appartment for three nights and loved everything about it. \\xa0It was quiet, comfortable, well-appointed and had everything we needed. \\xa0I would go so far as to say that it was better than described on the website.  Situated in a nice neighborhood and close to Fremont\\'s shops and restaurants made if perfect for us--away from the urban hussle and bussle, yet close to quality restaurants and shops and a neighborhood with character. \\xa0It is also in close enough proximity to downtown and everything a tourist would want to visit, but far enough away to get some peace and quiet during the day or night. We have no complaints at all and only positive feedback. \\xa0Would stay there again in a heartbeat. My boyfriend and I stayed here because I had a fashion show in the Fremont area. It was the perfect location for everything we wanted to do while in Seattle. Everything about our stay was great. Lovely view, quiet, clean, and well thought out for guests comfort.  I stayed at Mimi\\'s house for four nights , everything was wonderful clean and kitchen was well stocked I loved sitting on the deck and Mimi\\'s was very accommodating. Very peaceful relaxing place to stay I can not wait to go back to Seattle again . Thank you Mimi  Mimi is really a nice hostess. The apt is great. Glad I chose this one for my parents. The Fremont View apartment view was bright, spacious and comfortable with wonderful views of Fremont and Ballard. It has a fully equipped kitchen and includes use of a Mac computer and a grand piano. We loved taking walks in the neighborhood and enjoyed its proximity to lots of interesting parts of Seattle. Mimi was a gracious hostess and gladly accommodated our needs.  Mimi was a great host.  We didn\\'t get a chance to meet her, but our arrival was seamless and the place had everything we needed.  The side porch with a view of Seattle was our favorite part, but the apartment itself was full of charm and character and lots of natural light.  We would definitely like to stay here again if we make it back to Seattle. The apartment was wonderful! The space was easy to find, spotless, and an amazing price. Thank you so much  for renting us your space This apartment is great! Very well located, beautiful and has everything we needed.\\r\\nMimi was a great host providing us with valuable information about Seattle. I loved staying here!  I slept SO WELL!!!  And what a nice, huge space with a great view.  Great value.  As it mentions in the posting, this apartment is owned by folks with dogs, so avoid if you have allergies.   What a great spot to enjoy Seattle! The apartment had the perfect amount of space for two adults and a rambunctious toddler. The upstairs deck and circular layout also let us host two more for dinner and games in the sun. It\\'s right on the Fremont/Ballard border - a nice walk from Bourbon and Bones, The Dish, and other great eats. Hope to visit again soon! Mimi was a great host. She accommodated getting me into the house a few hours early. There is a MAC computer to use, a sweet smelling garden & a deck.  Fresh flowers & a guide of what to do in the area were waiting for me.  A spacious apt in a quiet, quaint neighborhood. I had a wonderful time staying at Mimi\\'s Air b&b in Fremont. The place is very clean, had everything we needed, and it\\'s in a great location! I would definitely stay here again next time I\\'m visiting Seattle. Mimi was great. Got in touch with us quickly and the house was in great condition. Also really great Seattle location.  The apartment was very comfortable.    It was clean and quiet.  I had no problems at all and I will most likely stay there again. Huge space, easy instructions for entering, all amenities listed were included  Nice enough apartment, but the draw here is location and price. It\\'s a great neighborhood and the view across the water makes for a really nice sunset. Communication and entry was no-nonsense and easy. Overall, a good, affordable place to stay. Not immaculate, but not unacceptable either. Mimi was a great host. It was very easy to check in. We loved the tea and coffee offered to us, and the house was very clean. We would definitely stay there again! We recently enjoyed a 1-night stay at Mimi\\'s apartment. The apartment itself has all the basics and is comfortable and we especially appreciated sitting on the cozy porch at night with a glass of wine. We also found it convenient to have a car space in front of the apartment. Although we did not meet Mimi in person, she was very responsive through emails and texts and she sent us the passcode for the front door prior to our arrival.  We absolutely LOVED Mimi\\'s place in Fremont. The view was just fantastic and the home is beautiful. We felt like we lived in Seattle for a few days. We will definitely be back!!! Thanks again for your hospitality.  Very nice place to stay. Apartment has a nice feel to it. Location is very central to great areas, but not walkable to very much.   Mimi was very welcoming and took the time to help us make the best use of our limited time in the area; mapping out scenic walking routes, and suggesting activities and restaurants in the Fremont neighborhood. Her apartment is clean and charming; in a section of Seattle with interesting houses, lots of flowers, wild blackberries growing nearby; close to many fun areas such as Queen Anne.  My husband and I were very pleased.  Mimi was very welcoming and the apartment was lovely! it was even more spacious than we expected and we love like to go back! Mimi\\'s house is adorable and exactly what we\\'d hoped to find for our stay in Seattle. It\\'s close to Fremont, which is a hip yet low-key neighborhood with restaurants, bars, shops, etc. \\n\\nWe enjoyed the deck and the view very much. \\n\\nMimi was a great host. Communication with her was easy, as was check in and check out. For the most part, we didn\\'t see her, so we had complete privacy and space. But we had the opportunity to meet her the night before we departed, and really enjoyed chatting with her.  If this system could rate a host with one to five stars, Mimi would get six. The apartment was terrific and very well stocked with everything you could need, including a computer and cell phone charger. But that is just background. Mimi herself is caring, interesting and the true definition of a terrific host. A couple of travel mishaps (my fault) occurred while we were there, and Mimi was incredibly fast in providing whatever help was needed. She went above and beyond. I would unhesitatingly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in a real cool area of Seattle.  Great host and very accommodating to our scheduling needs. Easy check in process. Liked the private entrance around the side of the house. Good location on a hill with a view of the water and bridge in the distance.  Her place was great! Sunny, private, and cute! Close walking proximity to Fremont. Would stay here again! =) Great view, cute place, short drive to Fremont coolness.  If you are a \"foodie\" and looking for a place to stay just outside of downtown Seattle - this is the place! Super quiet neighborhood, perfect for a couple\\'s getaway. Less than two miles from a ton of great local restaurants, bars and breweries in multiple neighborhoods. Dedicated parking spot and plenty of room in the apartment. Didn\\'t even miss not having a television for the week we stayed. Mimi was great getting us in with text and e-mail. Zero complaints, would gladly stay here again on our next visit to Seattle. Cute, older home. Centrally located, but not as walkable as I had expected due to a very busy street/industrial district between the house and the Ballard neighborhood. \\r\\n\\r\\nMimi did a great job of giving us clear instructions, leaving a clean and tidy place, and even left us chocolate as a welcome gift. The piano was a plus. Very much recommended if you are looking for a lowkey, quiet place to stay while in Seattle. The place was beautiful, clean, and spacious! The location is great and the view from the deck is lovely. Mimi was a fantastic host with quick responses and easy check-in. Such a pleasure to stay in your lovely space! I would highly recommend this Airbnb. It was centrally located between Ballard and Fremont with easy access to downtown Seattle. Plenty of space. Clean! Love the balcony too. Oh and the WiFi was super fast which was important to my business. Great communication with the host.  My overall experience at Mimi\\'s apartment was excellent.\\n\\nThe place was exceptionally clean and organized. The layout was just as the pictures suggested. The location was perfect for what I needed. I would recommend this dwelling for anyone staying in the Seattle area. Mimi was a splendid, welcoming host.  She happily greeted us to ensure we had everything we needed in the apartment. The place itself is comfortable and the location is great-within walking distance to mostly anything you need but secluded enough to feel like you\\'re not in the city. Thanks Mimi! Great location and perfect low key spot\\nFor two people. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. The piano was an added bonus! We really enjoyed staying here and felt right at home as we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The view of the Cascades at sunset was striking and wonderful. The piano was a nice surprise as I am a pianist and enjoyed playing it while I was there.  It was a nice gesture to put a chocolate bar on the bed--but there was no breakfast AND no directions to use the coffee pod pot.  The house is on a very high hill, with no store in sight.  It was particularly a problem for us, having traveled by plane across country.  Fortunately I brought a couple granola bars for us to have until our adult children could come to get us.  It was rather precarious to climb up a some stone steps and over an old wooden deck to get to the second floor entrance.  It was really tricky for my husband, who was wearing a cast on his foot. There was not railing all of the way.\\r\\n   As we were isolated, there was only a computer to use, which helped.\\r\\n   (No TV!!!)  When seated on the couch in the living room, there was just a baby grand piano and an African drum to view.  Since there was a 9 month old baby downstairs, I wasn\\'t inclined to play the piano.\\r\\n  The entertainment center in the bedroom had a wooden bar and hangers!\\r\\n    The sheets were leftover from a camp(old and worn) and the rugs in the bathroom needed to be washed. \\r\\n   Since there was only one washcloth provided, my husband got it as he washed up first.\\r\\n   It was very isolating and we were very frustrated by the situation. Had a great stay in Ballard!  Rob and Molly were super communicative and very accommodating.  Thanks! Could not have been better!  The house was perfect for us and our two dogs.  Rob was very responsive and incredibly flexible with our changing schedule, as we have just moved from MN to WA.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBeing able to stay in this home was a great respite for us and everything we needed was available.  We cannot say enough positive things! Comfy bed, stocked kitchen, clean, safe and easy to get to many different locations.  We loved that it was on the Burke-Gilman trail as well; just about a half mile from the trail.  Awesome.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe HIGHLY recommend this home as well as Rob & Molly--two most gracious and generous people.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you!! Everything was great at Rob and Molly\\'s! The house was charming and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again! This place was perfect! Spent a long weekend there with my parents for my dad\\'s 60th birthday and they just loved it. It was Just as described and so lovely. All the amenities of home. The location was great; a Safeway is very close as are many of the wonderful eateries and shops of Ballard. Rob and Molly were very responsive and access to the place was very easy. Hope I can stay here the next time I am back in Seattle. Can\\'t recommend enough!  The house was perfect for our stay in Seattle, cozy and clean. It felt like home away from home. Molly and Rob where always helpful and even brought us gifts for Christmas eve. Definetely hope to back soon! Super cute little house in Ballard! It\\'s a little older, so super modern amenities are lacking, but it adds to the charm of the house. Super comfy bed and the space is definitely accommodating for 2 adults. Parking is super easy and all the best eats are a short drive/uber away. Thanks for hosting us! Sunny Ballard Digs is all that it claims to be: darling, comfortable, and convenient. Rob and Molly seem like awesome people and were fantastic hosts. They left the house in good, clean shape for our arrival, a welcome note, and were easy and attentive to communicate with.  What a lovely little get-away! We had a wonderful week in our cozy home with retro furniture that was comfortable and fun. It\\'s a quiet neighborhood and parking was so easy. We plan to return in warmer weather to use the lovely backyard! Thank you Rob and Molly for our week in Seattle. We felt like we lived there again. The house is in a very convenient location, and is just as described.  Very cute retro decor and super clean and pet friendly.  We never met the hosts but knew they were in the area and would be easy to reach.   The neighborhood was great! Close enough to walk to a dog park which was so nice for Charlie. The place looked exactly like the pictures and was a perfect place to stay for a few days.  I had a great time staying at Rob and Molly\\'s place. Everything was clean when I arrived and they were very helpful with any questions I had. Nice place, cool neighborhood.  Rob and Molly\\'s place was the perfect home-away-from-home for our stay. Sunny, vintage, cute and comfy. Kitchen was well stocked! \\r\\n\\r\\nBallard is a walkable distance and it was super easy to get downtown with the bus a block away. Rob was extremely communicative and helpful with our need for a speedy last minute reservation- and quickly resolved our small hiccup at check-in. Wonderful hosts, thanks again! \\r\\n We had a nice stay at rob and Molly\\'s. Bedroom is cozy and comfortable. Bathroom is updated. Street is busy, but bedroom is quiet. Dog friendly with a small backyard. Communication was easy and we would stay here again. Had a great weekend stay here!  Place is exactly what you see in the listing.  Very convenient location with easy parking and easy check-in.  Great central-point for exploring all of Seattle! This cute, unique house in Ballard is in a great location to get pretty much anywhere in Seattle easily. We enjoyed exploring the nearby  neighborhood of Phinney Ridge and the downtown Ballard area - both within walking distance. The house had pretty much everything we needed for a comfortable stay: from making coffee in the morning with the French press to enjoying a beer at night while watching a little tv. The bed was comfortable too! Very cute, comfy house close to Ballard. Great restaurant down the street!  Sunny Ballard digs was really a welcome sight after the ice in NC. House was cozy and comfortable and perfectly situated in Frellard (or Balmont). Parking was a breeze and the wireless speedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBooks, beer, wine and daffodils ready to burst into bloom. What\\'s not to like? \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Sundays there are Markets year-round in both Ballard and Fremont. Rob and Molly were excellent hosts. They were quick to respond to any and all questions we had and mad sure to remind us to call on them if we needed anything at all. The space is beautiful with fun and quirky decor that made the place feel home. The kitchen was well-socked with cooking supplies and we enjoyed the local coffee that they had left for us. The bedroom was quiet and cozy and the blackout curtains made it all too easy to sleep in! The location can\\'t be beat and we enjoyed walking to dinner and discovering new places in the neighborhood each night. We are excited to make our next visit to Seattle and will definitely be staying here again. I would recommend it to absolutely anyone! Rob and Molly have the cutest place! It\\'s the perfect size for a couple or 3 friends. The rental is a 10-15 minute walk from Ballard, a great neighbourhood with boutique shopping, hip restaurants and bars.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were greeted with some local coffee, beer, and a bookshelf filled with quirky books. If you like retro furniture, reclaimed wood and old books, you will feel right at home. Thanks again for a wonderful stay! Our group loved Rob and Molly\\'s place. The location is prefect for walking to any of Ballard\\'s great breweries or night spots. The house is really nice and welcoming. We would stay here again. Quiet residential location, about 10 minutes walk from downtown Ballard. Great for a couple for a short stay, Rob and Molly are very accommodating.  Great spot! I hope to stay there again.  Listing was as described. Very nice and enjoyable. Close to everything that we wanted to do and see. Would love to come back one day.  Lovely time. Perfect spot. Very comfortable. Great sleep. Easy access- easy to find. Love being in Ballard when I visit Seattle and it was great to come back to this spot at the end of the day. For me it felt like home. \\n\\nthey were very gracious and worked w me on my varied days of travel. \\n\\nI would love to stay again when I come thru town. And would recommend to anyone.  Homey stay and convenient location.  Would certainly stay here again! We had a great stay in the Sunny Ballard Digs.  Definitely felt like a home away from home and  Rob & Molly were extremely accommodating.  The home is in a great area near Fremont and we found quite a few fun places to go.  Would definitely recommend this area and this place to friends! Rob and Molly were excellent hosts! Lovely home and accommodating!  The place was beautiful, a variety of vinyl records and books along with the warm decor made for a very cozy stay. I appreciate their hospitality and ease of communication.  We had a great stay at Rob and Molly\\'s, they\\'re home was exactly as pictured and was in a perfect neighborhood. There were so many fun local businesses and restaurants to explore in Ballard, even a great coffee shop within walking distance. We will definitely be stay here in the future again.  The house was a perfect rest over spot in Seattle on our way to Whistler. The house was super cute and very comfortable. Rob was great giving us some restaurant recommendations. We would definitely stay here again. We had a fantastic stay at Rob and Molly\\'s apartment. The place was clean and beautifully decorated in a kind of funky old-school way. We loved browsing the record collection and the smart TV came in handy at times, too. There was even a toddler bed for our little one, as well as lots of little kids\\' toys, which was a huge bonus. Location was easy access to much of what we wanted to do in the city, and Rob was really responsive in our correspondence. Would definitely stay here again.  The host canceled this reservation 25 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Nice spot for a short trip to Seattle.  The 1 bedroom apartment was as pictured and was nice & clean.  Rob and Molly were responsive before and during the stay, and made us feel warmly welcomed. Cute place! We stayed for 1 night and it was exactly as described, close to the city, quiet, and very clean. Easy to find parking on the street. Would definitely stay there again!

Will definitely be returning in the future!  Rob and Molly\\'s place was very nice and fit our needs perfectly!  The location was great, the place was as advertised, and the coffee was great!  Definitely would recommend staying here.   Great location near central Ballard and Fremont. The space was clean and comfortable and the hosts were responsive and helpful. We would definitely stay here again. My stay at Molly and Rob\\'s quaint little house in Ballard was wonderful. The 50\\'s, artsy motif was very cute and worked with the style of the house. Amenities were great and there were clear instructions on how to work the TV, stereo and the sound system. Even thou Molly and Rob weren\\'t on hand they answered my inquiries right away. It was just what I needed for a little R&R. We had a great time staying at Anna\\'s apartment. She went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. The apartment was very clean and new including the sheets, towels, appliances, glasses, and mugs. Anna was ready to help us out any way she could. The apartment is a short walk to downtown Ballard and there is a bus stop across the street making it very easy to get around or do some exploring. I would definitely stay here again! We loved our stay in Anna\\'s cosy home. It was spacious, immaculate and the bed was so comfortable (much needed for a jet-lagged traveller!).\\r\\nWe were welcomed by Anna, who was very helpful, and also by a lovely gift basket, which was so nice to arrive to. \\r\\nWe\\'ll definitely stay here again next time we\\'re in Seattle.  Anna was a great host!  The rental was clean and she made sure our stay was comfortable with goodies and great recommendations for restaurants and coffee.  This is a great place to stay if you just need a place to rest and sleep.  The Ballard basement was a delightful place to stay. It was bright and clean and well decorated. We had everything we needed. Anna left us a welcome basket with some treats and was very helpful and accommodating. It was in a great neighborhood close to great food, drinks and shops. Anna gave us good recommendations of places to visit. My partner and I had a great experience. We will definitely stay here again on return trips to Seattle!  Anna was a lovely host. She could not have been more helpful and made us feel at home. The bed in our two bedroom apartment was so comfortable and great water pressure.  I would be happy to stay there again We had a wonderful stay in Seattle in Anna\\'s Airbnb! The space was bright and comfortable, and the beds especially so! Anna was incredibly helpful and responsive and made our stay very easy! Anna was very welcoming, and the suite is great: quiet, comfortable, and central in Ballard. I would definitely stay here again. We had a wonderful time at Anna\\'s home. The suite is ideally situated and beautifully decorated; a bright, airy, comfortable space with some seriously cozy beds. The separate entrance and parking space guarantees a private stay, though Anna and her husband are lovely to chat with if you cross paths. Hospitable and easy going. I\\'d recommend this to two couples or up to four people looking for a nice landing pad for their trip.  Anna was very nice and greeted us when we arrived.  She also followed up to check if we slept comfortably. Anna was a fantastic host and we found her basement suite to be as advertised. \\n\\nI travelled with my wife and 2 infants (ages 2 & 1) and we were comfortable in the space provided.  \\n\\nAnna was incredibly hospitable and was very passionate about making sure we had a great stay.  We appreciated the nice little touches and accommodations she made for our family. \\n\\nShe was also extremely quick to respond to any questions we may have had (as advertised) the entire time - which was very helpful.  \\n\\nWe would most definitely stay with Anna again on our next trip into the Seattle area.  Our visit was short and sweet! The accommodation was bright and clean and met our needs for the Night. Anna was pleasant and answered all our questions.  Anna was an amazing host.  She was so friendly and unbelievably accommodating.  And the space was super clean and comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a fantastic stay! Anna and her husband were AWESOME. They were so welcoming (they left a little goodie basket upon our arrival), met us and welcomed us into their home. Their neighborhood is truly beuatiful-we had lived in seattle 9months and not until this stay did we find a neighborhood so beautiful. We walked to great coffee shops, dinner and a cute pub. The location is truly perfect. This was a great spot for us and is super close to some amazing food and coffee options. Will definitely stay here again.  Anna\\'s place was in a great location for us, and she was very friendly and sweet. There were nice touches, like oranges, pellegrino and some beers in the fridge. There was also a space heater, which was nice since it got a little cold in the basement. We brought our dog, and there was a perfect park 2 blocks away where we could take her to romp. The bed was comfortable, it was the perfect place to crash after a long day in Seattle. Also having our own parking spot was awesome. Everything was super clean.  Anna has been very nice and a great host. We found some fruirs and beverages when arrived and that was really nice from herself. The place is strategically located between two really cool neiborhoods, Fremont and Ballard, but at the same time in a quiet street. The bathroom was just renovated and the apt was really clean. It\\'s a basement as stated in the website but you get a lot for what you pay. I\\'ll definitively check back with Anna next time I\\'ll come to Seattle! livio Great location in Ballard for walking for coffee and the many breweries in the area. Live in Seattle and was a great place while my floors were being redone in Wallingford.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe host was amazing and left snacks and made us feel welcome over the week. Anna was very friendly and responsive--I booked her place for my family during their visit to Seattle and it was seamless.  They thought the place was great and my grandmother raved about the how comfortable the bed was :)  Anna was a wonderful host and the apartment she provided was perfect for our needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWelcome chocolates and nuts as well as water and beer made us feel really welcome. She also let us use her own washing machine and dryer, which were new top-of-the-line stuff. There is no cooking grill or hobs or oven, just a microwave oven and fridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basement apartment is a little rough around the edges. You\\'ll see exposed rafters, a little bit of spider webbing there, the floor has a few pits and slightly uneven ground. You enter via the garage which has Anna\\'s stuff. So if you are looking for a hotel-style, perfectly manicured lodging, look elsewhere. Otherwise, it was very neat and clean where it mattered. Very personal and homely touch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is in the suburbs so expect 20 mins or so transit by car to the city if that is where you are headed. During rush hour traffic that might be double. Otherwise, the location is safe and convenient, gas and groceries within walking distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we arrived, she explained that both bedrooms would have individual space heaters. At night, we only found one, and we called her to check on where is the other heater. Turns out she mistakenly remembered she only has one. Within the hour, she went out and came back with a brand new heater. So I have absolutely no doubt that Anna will take care of your needs and concerns promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you Anna! We had a great stay with Anna - she\\'s a very warm and welcoming hostess! We really loved the space (looks exactly like the photos) and location as it\\'s about a 10-15 minute walk to lots of great restaurants in Ballard. Because the space is the basement, there is a little bit of noise in the mornings from upstairs, but we\\'d definitely stay there again next time we visit Seattle. My friends and I really enjoyed our stay in Seattle in Anna\\'s apartment. Everything was clean and comfortable and Anna was a welcoming host. We particularly enjoyed her suggestions for places to eat in her guidebook! The location was very central and gives a nice and quiet neighborhood feel while downtown Seattle and many other attractions are only a short drive away. Since the apartment is in the basement of her home there is some noise in the mornings but definitely not a deal breaker for this great find! Awesome place. Smooth check-in / check-out. The place is tidy and as nice as described. Anna was always there if we needed any help. Quiet neighbourhood. Would definitely recommend! Anna\\'s accommodations were wonderful. It is centrally located in the ballard neighborhood which I found to be one of the better parts of seattle. The beds were very comfortable and it had all the amenities I needed. Would highly recommend. Anna\\'s apartment was wonderful! So centrally located and perfect for the two of us and our young daughter. Anna was so easy to get a hold of and checked in with us to make sure everything was going well. The welcome basket was such a sweet touch. We really loved our stay and will definitely be back!  Anna and Nick have an amazing place! Everything we needed was supplied and the parking space made getting in and out super easy. The beds were great and it was a home away from home. I will definitely be staying here next time I visit Seattle. \\n\\nP.S. check out her guidebook. Slate coffee is amazing.  Anna was a really nice, warm and welcoming host. She had carefully thought out what we would need to make our stay comfortable. From providing a welcome gift basket to fresh towels and body wash and sharing the fruits of the family cherry tree, we felt very at home. We even used the earplugs for sound sleeping that she had on offer.\\n\\nThe accommodation was exactly as described and very nicely decorated.\\n The beds were very comfortable and access and communication was easy.\\n\\nAnna was very helpful with providing suggestions for the area and restaurants. We really enjoyed the restaurants she recommended and we loved Ballard. There was so much to do in Ballard and it is a very cute and fun area, close to everything. We loved our stay at Anna\\'s place. She and her family are very kind and accommodating! We felt very welcome and enjoyed the snack basket they left for us. The rooms were very clean and the beds were super comfy. Their house is within walking distance of many great attractions. We walked to the zoo, the Ballard farmers market, and some nice restaurants. 15 minute Uber ride to pike place market and to the Link to the airport. We highly recommend this place for anyone looking to visit Seattle! Wonderful welcome to Seattle.. Anna was there to greet us and show us around the place. We were able to do our laundry which was such a treat after days on the road. She also had a little basket of treats :) The neighborhood is really charming. I definitely recommend staying here.  Anna was responsive to e-mails and texts. She was there to greet us when we arrived. She even remembered Us from our first visit. Clean space, comfortable beds, tasty snacks, close to Slate Coffee. Anna was an incredibly warm person. She made us feel right at home after our long day driving. She showed us around, provided us with a cute welcome basket and offered any help for the duration of our stay. The place was cute and quaint. I found the photos to speak truly of the space as well. The beds were very comfy and the rooms were adorably decorated. The evening we stayed we helped ourselves to some tea that Anna provided. It was tasty and the perfect way to end our evening. Anna mentions in the description that the place has some rough edges but I found these to add to the eclectic style of the place. Definitely nothing to scoff at. Location wise, you can\\'t find any better. A very short drive to Gas Works Park and even shorter to some delicious eats (Paseos!) Overall, lovely location, setting and host.  Anna\\'s place was great! Cozy and very convenient in a great neighborhood. She was a great host and catered to our needs. We were two couples with two babies and she went out of her way to make us welcome including lending us a crib. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The house was ok for the price.\\r\\nAnna was very nice and very responsive!\\r\\nThe house didn\\'t have everything you would expect (dish towels, spoons, etc.) but she provided them when we asked. \\r\\nit\\'s a basement apartment without a finished ceiling, so although she keeps the house clean it tends to seem dusty. Also because of the unfinish ceiling noises carry from upstairs.\\r\\nBut it\\'s a great location and Anna is great! Anna was a great host and the apartment was exactly as described. I would definitely recommend this place for a stay in Seattle. The Ballard neighborhood was a short walk away and fun to spend the day in.  Anna greeted us kindly with treats and info. She was very gracious and helpful. She has done so many thoughtful things to make our stay comfortable and convenient. She even bought a toaster because she knew we loved toast! Can\\'t say enough good things about this stay. Anna was great. She was available and completely willing to answer questions and help out. The apt in the basement was exactly as described, and very comfortable. I would absolutely stay again when I return to Seattle Wonderful, cute basement with the most comfortable beds and bedspreads ever! Anna was a kind and gracious host who went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The location is perfect. 15 minutes to downtown but you really don\\'t need to leave because the Ballard neighborhood has so many wonderful places to eat and drink! We will definitely be staying here on our next trip to Seattle!  It was a great pleasure to stay at Anna\\'s place. She\\'s very kind and flexibele. The Appartment was perfect for a short stay in Seattle. Thanks again Anna. A very charming and impeccably kept suite in a cool neighbourhood! Anna was wonderful and very accommodating as our host for our short stay in Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould definitely recommend this suite and host! Great location! You can walk to almost everything you would want. Anna was extremely friendly and was willing to help out any way she could. Perfect first Air B&B experience! Anna was super friendly and the place was exactly what we expected. Check-in/out was easy and convenient, as was the location would definitely recommend and definitely book again for our next stay! Perfect first Air B&B experience! Anna was super friendly and the place was exactly what we expected. Check-in/out was easy and convenient, as was the location would definitely recommend and definitely book again for our next stay! Anna and her family were great hosts! The space was comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet. Anna helped with dinner recommendations and loaned us some beach towels/ blankets to take to the beach. There was a bit of construction going on, so there was some daytime noise, but we were forewarned ahead of time, so no big deal. Overall a great experience and we would certainly return! Also - beds were very cozy - a big plus! Anna was a wonderful host, accomidating and quick with communication.   The house was cozy and comfortable.  We had two couples staying and had plenty of space and privacy.  The house was in a great spot, only a few steps away from a bus stop and a short walk to restaurants, coffee shops etc.  We would gladly stay again! We had a great stay. It was a perfect spot for our family of four. We most enjoyed walking to coffee and bakery and getting to know the neighborhood cats and the beds here are exceptionally cozy. Anna\\'s family are early risers so if you are a light sleeper definitely make use of the ear plugs provided. What a great space, so cosy & inviting.\\nIt easily accommodated both me & my sister & her husband.\\nVery clean & well presented with a few welcoming treats.\\nAnna was very accommodating & happy to help with any issue.\\nClose to Rapid Transit options into downtown.\\nAnna also gave us a great local restaurant tip that proved to be fantastic. A must - Señor Moose!\\nA definite recommendation, thanks for a great stay. Anna was so warm, welcoming and flexible when our arrival time changed. The listing was just as pretty in person as the photos and very comfortable. Those beds! I\\'ve never slept so well while away on vacation! The location was perfect, too. Close to a lot of cute shops and restaurants, and central enough that catching an Uber was a snap! There is a private entrance that was so convenient. Anna had a few refreshments waiting for us upon arrival which was such a lovely gesture.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnna went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable, and we so appreciated it! It was a great first trip to Seattle, thanks in large part to Anna!  My host was very welcoming and upfront about everything that she felt might be an issue (staying below an active family with a toddler and the noise level that comes with that).  She was very accommodating, quickly answering any questions (do you have an iron/ironing board, etc.).  Everything was very clean, the beds/pillows were totally comfortable, the white noise machines worked wonderfully. Her descriptions were accurate, check-in/out was very easy and simple. The location was excellent to come and go from.  It was my first experience with a bnb and I loved it. There was a large refrigerator, inside was a filtered water pitcher (a plus), there was a microwave, dishes, a little table and 2 chairs. I loved that it had two bedrooms, since it was my daughter and I staying there. If I get to visit the city again I will definitely try to book this one again. Anna made us feel very welcome upon checking in!  She provided us with some snacks, and she also had toiletries and dishes stocked for use as needed which came in very handy during our stay.  Our accommodations were very clean and we had plenty of fresh linens for the bathroom.  Anna was also great about answering questions and helping us out with anything we needed while we were visiting Seattle.  The location was great, we were walking distance from downtown Ballard, which had lots of cute shops, restaurants, bars, etc.  The bus routes were also conveniently located for ease with public transportation.  Overall we had a terrific stay, and would definitely recommend this listing to anyone looking for accommodations in the Seattle area. We had a wonderful time at Anna\\'s home. We loved that it\\'s located in the Ballard neighborhood - we were able to walk to the majority of the breweries, bars and restaurants that we wanted to visit. Anna was very easy to get in touch with, she made sure we were comfortable and knew about the neighborhood. The beds were super comfy and the house was quiet. Would definitely recommend and look forward to visiting Seattle again in the future!  Anna was welcoming and kind. The apartment was clean and convenient. White noise machines were great! Anna was a terrific host - the space was perfect for us: parents and a grown sibling visiting a Seattle college student!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beds were comfy and each room had some space to spread out. Great location and easy parking.  Thanks Anna!  Anna had a great place in Ballard close to many things and greeted us when we arrived. Clean towels and sheets were provided. The basement flat had laundry machines that were being used by Anna and her family with dirty laundry on the floor which was a bummer.\\n\\nWe should have read all the reviews. It is a basement flat which has thin ceilings and you can hear everything from upstairs. Anna did provide ear plugs and sound machines for our convenience. Anna\\'s place is in an excellent location, very walkable easy access to Ballard shops and restaurants. We arrived to snacks and a fridge stocked with sparkling and still water and a nice welcome note from Anna. The place was just as pictured, a very clean basement apartment. Beds were comfortable, it was the perfect place to stay for a night in Seattle. Will definitely be re-booking in the future.  The host was very friendly and went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. The beds were very comfortable and the unit very clean. the location was good to walk to several restaurants and some shops but if you\\'re not familiar with Seattle, it is not very central. Although it\\'s mentioned in the description, I wasn\\'t expecting the host to be doing laundry (which is in the rental unit) while I was in the apartment so that and the pile of dirty laundry was a bit of a turn off. Overall, it was a nice stay and well equipped for two guests, would also be nice for two coupes because the rooms are private. However there is no central area to hang out together except sitting at the small dining table.  We only had a fleeting visit, but was lovely. Great little basement flat with incredibly comfy beds. Anna was very welcoming and gave some recommendations of  great Seattle eateries. Thanks for a short but sweet stay! Work took me to Seattle. My host\\'s demeanor made me wish to move to Seattle! Very clean, easy, comfortable place to stay. Wasn\\'t very noisy at all, there\\'s white noise machines incase. (I predicted heaps of noise from the summary Anna gave). Anna was very welcoming and helpful with suggestions. Good location.  Anna was a great host. Showed us how to use the laundry which was muchly need!! Also had a basket of treats for us which was beyond our expectations. The place was well heated and beds were comfy and only heard Anna\\'s son cry once - pretty good for a 2yr old!! Anna even let me borrow her hair dryer! Anna\\'s place is so close to everything in Ballard. Slate Coffee up the road is to die for!! Thanks for the suggestion. Would definitely come back!! Anna made us feel very welcome and was so hospitable in every way. She supplied us with everything we needed including coffee, teas, sparkling water, chocolates which only made us all smile! Both beds were extremely comfortable and the location was perfect to wherever we wanted to go. Great place exactly as described. Parking was easy. No problems whatsoever. This by far was the best experience I could have ever asked for. Being very new to Airbnb we really didn\\'t know what to expect, this two bedroom bright basement felt like home as soon as we walked in. It was spacious enough for my husband and 3 boys. Beds were large and super comfy. Location was perfect and a hop skip and a jump from any attraction Seattle has to offer. Thank you Anna for making us feel like family, you were the perfect host!!  Became Strava friend With Anna, enough said! Excellent stay! The place was very clean and comfortable. The location is great, we loved Ballard and our stay here! Highly recommend.  We had a great experience staying at Anna\\'s! Great location and she went out of her way to make us feel welcome. The place was very clean, welcoming and homey! Anna was super easy to reach and work with. Definitely would recommend.  Anna was very welcoming and friendly which made our first AirBnB experience a great one. Anna was very responsive to our texts and requests, and always asked what she could do to make our stay more comfortable - even offing a portable crib for our toddler.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe space is just as she describes and was perfect for what we needed. The beds were cozy and comfortable, great pillows, and lots of extra blankets, too. The white noise machine was so helpful in getting our daughter to relax and fall asleep as well. We hardly heard anything going on upstairs the entire stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was easy to get to and centrally located for our plans (perfect for visiting the zoo). I really appreciated the small touches, like applesauce in the fridge for our 1 year old daughter, and I could tell Anna had gone through and made the space very toddler-friendly.  I would definitely stay again! Our accommodations were great. The description and pictures were accurate. Our beds were so comfortable. Our host was awesome and paid great attention to details that brought smiles to the end of a great day in Seattle. \\nWe\\'d recommend and stay again.  Anna was very welcoming and easy to communicate with. The space is a very simple basement which suited our utilitarian purposes perfectly. the location and space were a bit noisy, however she had provided white noise machines which were great and allowed everyone to enjoy a good night sleep. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an awesome budget option in Ballard. Anna was an incredible hostess. Her house guide was easy to follow and her home was in a perfect location. Once we arrived Anna made us feel super welcome and at home! We even needed a hair dryer early in the morning, and she brought it down immediately. So kind! \\n\\nThe location was a renovated garage, and it\\'s one of the coolest locations ever. It had two completely separate rooms both decorated to the tee, a small common room area with a refrigerator and microwave, and a private bathroom. Anna left coffee, tea, and chocolates and honestly we couldn\\'t have asked for a better host. We can\\'t recommend Anna enough!! Thank you, Anna and family :) I had three friends visiting over Thanksgiving and needed a location close to my own home in Ballard for them to stay. Anna\\'s was perfect - within walking distance to my house as well as the rest of Ballard! The space was clean and well appointed and Anna was very communicative and happy to help. My friends did note that while toddlers definitely do live above the the basement rooms, the noise was not overly disruptive. \\r\\n\\r\\nGreat location and space, would definitely rent again when I have visitors in town! Anna was awesome! So welcoming and warm, as well as knowledgeable about the area. The space was bright and comfortable and had everything we need, nothing we didn\\'t. Just as described! We had a great time staying at Anna and her husband\\'s home! The basement apartment is plenty spacious, the beds were really comfy, and the location is great for exploring the Ballard and Fremont neighborhoods. Anna was very friendly and accommodating, and was super easy to communicate with! Definitely would recommend this to any small group headed to Seattle. Our extended stay worked out perfectly.  The home is in a very quiet, safe neighborhood.  There was adequate parking on the street, so your car can be just steps away.  The home was very functional, clean and stylish.  Our requests for additional kitchen tools was immediately and cheerfully addressed.  Amelia always responded right away, and was a pleasure to work with.  Highly recommended. Amelia and Marisa were extremely hospitable and accommodating hostesses. I stayed at this location for three months (quite a long time) and whenever I had a concern or question for them they addressed it as soon as they were able. They even addressed a few things that I informed them of but didn\\'t expect them to fix. The unit was in good condition and clean when I arrived, and was stocked with toilet paper, paper towels, and cleaning supplies. Amelia and Marisa even provided a second queen bed so my roommate and myself could convert the living room into a second bedroom for the summer. They also gave out advice and recommendations on where to go in Ballard and Seattle as a whole. Since I was staying in the area for three months I was hoping to find a living situation that did not require needing to purchase furniture or any big items, but allowed me to feel like a local. Amelia and Marisa provided the perfect solution. We absolutely loved staying here!!  It was super comfortable and we had everything we needed.  We loved the neighborhood and were able to walk to most places from here - Ballard historical district, Ballard Locks, and even the zoo (which was a workout but so worth it for the gorgeous views!). The bed was definitely more comfortable than a hotel and we slept great!  This was our first Airbnb experience and we hope to never stay in a hotel again!  We chose this place to get a real-life feel of Seattle and we certainly got it!  We are planning to move here next spring!!!  We will definitely recommend this place to any friends who want to come visit your beautiful city!  Thanks again!!   I had a great time staying in this Ballard home. Amelia was a good, attentive host. I mostly kept to myself, but when I had any questions, she was quick to respond. The space itself was very well maintained, clean and comfortable. The kitchen, bathroom and linen closet were well-stocked with the basics, so that when I arrived, I felt right at home. The house was perfect. Everything was superclean and super well done. There was even some nice food and drinks in the fridge. I was there for almost a month and I felt like it was home. When I did have a couple of small requests they were handled immediately. Five Stars! Amelia was an awesome host!! While planning our stay, she responded quickly to my emails and answered all my questions. The house was adorable and perfect my husband and I on our anniversary trip to Seattle . Amelia even checked with me after we settled in to make sure we didn\\'t need anything or have any questions about the area. We would definitely recommend the house !!! Thanks again Amelia !!! I was very happy with my stay in the \"Modern Classic~Convenient~Priv Home\".  The space was clean and very comfortable, with all my needs in place, and the location was easy for me to access both work and restaurants for after-work.  Thanks to Amelia for the ease of check-in and responsiveness. Nice and comfortable apartment in a safe and green neighborhood. Amelia is very friendly and responsive host. We really enjoyed our stay! It was a great location. I felt very safe and comfortable. Access to public transportation. The neighborhood was quite and peaceful. Thank you the for the detailed information left in the house.  Excellent location and a comfortable home. It made our extended stay in Seattle a super visit. Hosts were gracious and helpful with questions and responses always prompt. Our first experience with AirNB and even better than we expected.  We had a wonderful time at this place. The place was clean and quiet. The house had everything we needed. We actually extended our stay from 30 days to 34 days. The neighborhood was wonderful. It was very easy to walk to everywhere. Ballard is a great neighborhood. We will certainly visit again. This place was delightful.  Amelia left a welcoming note with chocolates, and everything after that was just a little better than expected.  Condiments, spices, coffee filters, band aids, energy bars, \\r\\nexcellent bed and bath (although the tub is plumbed backwards, you\\'re not out of hot water, twist the valve clockwise!). Surprisingly private even with the adjacent living spaces, great safe neighborhood with ample street parking, walkable to downtown Ballard and other shopping.  Problem with coffeemaker was resolved immediately.  So glad we found it, can\\'t wait to return. Amelia was the greatest! The house is beautiful and in a fantastic location. Super close to a bus that takes you directly downtown, easy walk to several great grocery stores and nearby Downtown Ballard. We had everything we could need for a several month stay and felt right at home. The place was very clean and the bed is comfy! Amelia even upgraded us to faster internet. We want to come back! We had a very comfortable and pleasant stay for the month of September at Amelia and Foxy\\'s \"Modern Classic-Convenient Private Home\" in Ballard, Seattle. The apartment with two private outside entrances was clean and nicely furnished. The people in the adjacent main floor unit and in the basement apartment were very quiet. The residential Ballard neighborhood is very walkable and the bus was close. We rarely used our car. We would gladly stay here again if we have the opportunity.  Everything worked perfectly at Amelia\\'s. She wasn\\'t able to meet us but she has a complete guide waiting for her guests as they arrive. Everything you need to know is there. Place is exactly like the pictures, wi-fi works great, has a complete kitchen and washer and dryer. The neighborhood is also excellent: quiet and we felt very safe. A few blocks away you find a fantastic supermarket (Ballard Market) and major bus lines are very close to the house. Bottom line: would definitely recommend it! Very cute! Has everything you will need. The washer and dryer are a big plus. Bed was very comfortable. Amelia was wonderful, she was able to get me a bicycle to use during my stay as well. I will see if this place is available for future stays. Thanks for everything Amelia!!  This listing is a charming and spacious duplex apartment located close to the shops and restaurants of Ballard. Amelia & Foxy welcomed us to their apartment on our second day and helped us understand how to use the smart TV. The apartment is well appointed with all the necessary kitchen and bath accessories and the bed was soft and comfortable; the apartment was warm and cozy during a chilly week. We will re-book on future visits to Seattle.  Really fantastic townhouse in a great location.  We stayed for NYE and were so close to tons of nightlife in Ballard.  The house was a perfect size for two couples to stay comfortably and the owner made the whole experience really easy. Would definitely stay again! We had a wonderful stay in Seattle and Steven was a great host. He was extremely organized and available even while traveling if we had any questions (although he had a gDocs spreadsheet with all the information we could possibly want so we never needed him!). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe townhouse is in a great location close to downtown Seattle and within walking distance to many shops, restaurants, bars and grocery stores.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would definitely stay again! I booked this house of behalf of some clients of mine who were doing some work In Seattle. They thoroughly enjoyed their stay, loved the place and the location was very convenient for them. Steve was very fast at responding to my emails and made the booking process very easy.  The listing was just as described and Steven was very helpful with all questions both leading up to and during our stay.  We had a great stay in Ballard at Steven\\'s house. The house was well-equipped, clean, and very comfortable. It was also conveniently located close to downtown Ballard. I would definitely recommend it! Wonderful property, lots of natural light. Nicely decorated and very comfortable. It has everything you would need to cook a meal and the beds are very comfortable.\\nGreat communication with owner - he was very attentive and accessible during our stay.\\nNice location too! Steven saved the day for me! I was getting married and the place me and my party were going to get ready had an emergency. Steven was the only person who was got me back and helped me out. He was the best host ever and his place was amazing. Steven is the best and the nicest person ever. He really did save the day for the wedding. I am so grateful for everything. Thank you so much Steven you are an amazing person!  Steven made us feel very welcome, he always got back to us straight away while we were making arrangements which we really appreciated.  His house was amazing - we loved it and would recommend it to anyone (who could manage stairs). Steven was an amazing host! \\r\\n\\r\\nHis condo is stocked with plenty of amenities and is located in a fantastic area in Ballard. This place is one of the best AirBnBs I\\'ve stayed in.  The location was very convenient to cute neighborhoods but away enough to have adequate street parking. The place was spotless and clean and very comfortable. I would stay here again.  Was a great stay in Seattle! Was only there for one night but the house was perfect. Very technologically up to date and it was especially nice to not have to have a key because of the keypad lock. Steven was great and provided lots of information on both the home and the area. Very organized, very caring, and a great house. We greatly enjoyed our stay! Thank you! Steven\\'s house was beautiful and we had a great time! Thank you so much! Mike and Laura really made our Thanksgiving special as they opened up their home to our family on such short notice over a holiday that could\\'ve been a disaster. Their kitchen is wonderful and spacious enough to prepare dinner for 10 or more.  \\n       They are very gracious and easy to work with I highly recommend their place as it is located in a perfect spot to explore Seattle without even having a car. The view on the deck upstairs is breathtaking.  Located near the bus line as well.\\n        Highly recommend. Mike and Laura were incredibly gracious hosts, having a welcome gift and kind note waiting for us upon our arrival. Their home was very well kept, spacious, and aligned perfectly with their description. It was within walking distance to the great amenities that Ballard has to offer.  Mike and Laura made themselves available via phone/text for any issues we may have had (which we didn\\'t!), but were otherwise respectful of the time our family had together. Their space afforded my family a wonderful holiday experience. Highly recommended.  We really enjoyed our stay at Mike and Laura\\'s home. Well-stocked kitchen and comfortable rooms. Ballard is a great location for visiting many areas of Seattle, especially while visiting SPU.  Our hosts, Javier & Yeon were very warm and friendly and we were made very welcome. The listing was as described and their Ballard Neighbourhood was very quiet, peaceful with plenty of parking and very close to all the amenities. We enjoyed our stay very much.  Javier & Yeon were great hosts!  They live in a beautiful neighborhood and their home is very clean and has a warm atmosphere.  They were very friendly and left cookies and fruit in the room for me.  I felt very welcome and I\\'d definitely go back again. I had a great time exploring Ballard, which quickly became my favorite neighborhood after visiting Seattle for a few days.  The location was perfectly situated around restaurants and fun bars.  Javier was very helpful with suggestions on where to hang out and walk around.  The room also came equipped with everything I needed for the night.  I\\'ll be back, for sure! Javier and Yeon were extremely gracious hosts. Our plane came in late but they still let us in at 1 am when we finally arrived. The room and bathroom were spotless and the bed comfortable. The location is very walkable to the Ballard area. Overall it was great.  The title says it all! Very friendly and peaceful place to stay! I booked at the last minute and Javier & Yeon were very accommodating! ( I even got yummy fresh strawberries!!) The room was spotless and very comfortable! I had immediate access to the bathroom without having to interrupt the hosts. The location is great with everything you need within a few blocks. Highly recommend Javier & Yeon\\'s room! Thank you! Javier and Yeon were incredibly welcoming and I greatly enjoyed staying with them. Their place is perfectly located in Ballard, an easy walk from the restaurants and shops on Market Street, and an easy drive from the rest of Seattle. I\\'d highly recommend it! Even better the second time around! Javier and Yeon were very pleasant and accommodating! Thanks again! Wow! I don\\'t even know where to begin. This was my first airbnb experience and I don\\'t think it could have been better! Javier and Yeon were absolutely wonderful hosts - they were flexible, generous, and made us feel right at home. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was wonderful not only to share their beautiful clean space, but also have dynamic conversation and a delicious home cooked meal together. They had great suggestions for what to do in the neighborhood and beyond and we weren\\'t disappointed when we took up on a few of their suggestions. Slate coffee is amazing!\\r\\n\\r\\nI will definitely be staying here next time I visit the Seattle area and recommend this place for anyone who wants to stay somewhere that feels just like home. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you Javier and Yeon!  Javier & Yeon are absolutely wonderful hosts! My friend and I stayed here this past weekend in Seattle and it was an extremely comfortable stay. Not only were Javier & Yeon accommodating with our arrival time being before check in but they were also very helpful with many wonderful suggestions. When we arrived to the house, it was exactly as pictured and everything was so clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ballard area is so great- filled with a big variety of coffee shops, bars, and restaurants you can\\'t go wrong! We took public transportation for the majority of our trip so having the D line bus stop so close to the house was a huge plus! \\r\\n\\r\\nJavier & Yeon were very easy to communicate with, generous with their help, and even prepared fruit and delicious pastries for us! Needless to say, we are grateful to have stayed in this very friendly place in Ballard. \\r\\n Javier and Yeon were both extremely nice, generous, and thoughtful. I had an extended stay at \"A Friendly Place In Ballard\" and I absolutely loved it. The townhome is very close to many restaurants, stores, and breweries.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this place. The room is comfortable, spotless, and you really couldn\\'t ask for two nicer people to host your stay. You won\\'t regret your stay in Ballard! Javier & Yeon were excellent host! The room was exactly the same as described on Airbnb page. It was even better!! They kindly invited us to a dinner and we had great time. The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful. Thank you for the great time.  We had a great stay. The rooms and apartment were just as depicted in the description and photos. It was very clean. They were very accommodating and quick to respond to our needs. Parking was very easy on the street. Thanks for a lovely stay; we look forward to visiting Seattle again! Javier and Yeon were the perfect hosts.  Great insight to the neighborhood and things to do, generous with their time, yet respectful of my time and space.  This is a great location, and I couldn\\'t recommend it more! It was very nice to stay at Javier and Yeons in Seattle. \\r\\nThe place is nice and clean and the hosts are nice and helpful.\\r\\nWe will recommend this place.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest regards Johnny Bastiansen This was a great place to stay. Javier an Yeon were lovely hosts and I had a great night\\'s sleep. Staying with Javier and Yeon was a joy. They were so friendly and made me feel right at home. Everything was as described, clean and in a great location. Javier and Yeon were also really helpful with suggestions of things to do in the neighborhood. I would highly recommend staying here! Thanks Javier and Yeon! Our family member got snowed in and never made it to Seattle so we never used \"A Friendly Place in Ballard\".  The hosts were inviting, accommodating and in frequent contact with us.  Sorry that we missed the opportunity to stay there but will keep it in mind for next time! Javier and Yeon are the sweetest and most accommodating people you will meet.  The neighborhood is wonderful and literally a minute or two to downtown Ballard where there are shops and restaurants.  The home is clean, warm and welcoming.  When my plans changed they were gracious and understanding.    It\\'s very lucky for me to spent several days with Javier and Yeon in their lovely  home first time using Airbnb.  They are both very kind and considerate, giving us great recommendations of where to eat or enjoy coffee. And their home locates in a terrific location for visitors who don\\'t have a car, which is less than five minutes to Dline station heading to Seattle downtown.  \\n\\nSince we have a tight schedule visiting Seattle this time,  there\\'s not much time spending quality time with them but we still had great time chatting with Airbnb App. \\n\\nNext time I visit Seattle, I will definitely choose Javier and Yeon \\'s home. The place was super chill. I would totally be bros with the dudes. The parking spot was nice, the bathroom was uber modern and the whole thing was killer and well thought out. Host was easy to contact and flexible on arrival and departure times.   Place was great, just as advertised.  So nice to be close to restaurants and bus lines straight to downtown. What a wonderful AirBnB experience! The suite was exactly as described - spacious, clean, modern and private. Brian was accommodating and easy to communicate with. Very cool and would definitely stay there again. Brian and his roommates made us feel welcome.  He gave us a tour of the upstairs suite with calm clean decor, amazing shower and heated floors in the bathroom(!).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were welcome to use the kitchen, but with so many great restaurants, bakery\\'s and coffee shops ( like Slate) nearby there was no reason to cook. Loved the space and location! The host and his housemate were communicative and helpful. I would definitely stay in this space again!  The room was huge and comfortable, a very good value compared to other places that I\\'ve stayed. Brian was a stellar host.  Very welcoming.  I would stay again anytime! Brian was very accommodating.  The upstairs floor is very new and spacious.  It fit all my needs. The stay was very pleasant and I\\'d choose this location again when needed. \\r\\nIt was very easy to walk to nearby restaurants and stores. \\r\\nThis house is close to downtown Seattle, Green lake, Greenwood, the U W campus, North gate, and downtown Ballard.  \\r\\nThis was a great experience.  Thank you Brian. My stay with Brian was too quick. He was a generous host who shared many great tips about how to enjoy his neighborhood. He was also  flexible about my arrival and departure schedule.  I hope to return. This was an awesome place to stay!  Brian contacted me a couple of times prior to my arrival which made my arrival smooth and easy.  The room was just as pictured, clean and spacious.  Brian and his roommates are kind, helpful, and an all around good time.  The location is perfect.  Walking distance to fun restaurants/bars but also a short drive/bus ride to anywhere is Seattle for the most part.  Would recommend! \\r\\n Great second stay at this house in Ballard. Brian and his roommates remain nice and helpful. Room is private enough to feel secluded but main floor is open and welcoming. Hope to come back again soon! Brian is very helpful, accommodating,  and friendly.  Room was very comfortable.  A+ Brian was incredibly welcoming and made sure we were ready for success within our trip. He was going to be on vacation after we arrived and made sure we knew who would be taking care of us afterwards. The living area was well maintained and incredibly comfortable.  Our stay with Brian was perfect! Brian was out of town but his roomate Zack proved to be a fantastic host as well. Very cute upstairs living space, and the shower is amazing!! I highly recommend this air bnb!  Staying in this house was a treat! Although we didn\\'t get to meet Brian as he was traveling, his cousin and housemate Zack was very welcoming and hospitable.  My boyfriend and I had plenty of privacy on the top floor of the house, and easy access to the kitchen, yard and laundry.  Their other roommate Noel, is friendly and helpful as well.  Zack was very accommodating with our arrival time and great at responding via airbnb messaging. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room itself is beautiful and very comfortable. The bed is better than the one I have at home, and the bathroom too! We visited during a warmer than usual summer week in Seattle, but the small standing air condition cooled the room well as long as we closed the window shades while we were out for the day.  While in the room, we would keep the bathroom door closed, especially after a shower, so the bedroom would stay cool enough. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all it was a wonderful stay! A bit of a splurge for us at $115 a night, but worth it.  Brian and Zack are really friendly and the room is exactly what they describe it, clean, modern and with all the facilities you need. The community is quite and clean as well. We would love to stay at their place again. Exceeded expectations!  Great location in Ballard with easy access to public transportation to explore the city.  The upstairs private quarters was above an beyond our expectations.  The space was very clean, comfortable, private and Brian provided all the essentials with information on things to do around the city and how to get around.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBrian was an excellent host and my wife and I enjoyed conversing with him and his cousin over a couple of homebrews.  We will definitely stay here again when we make our way back out to Seattle. Brian is an amazing host and makes you feel very welcome. He is very organized and easy to get communicate with. The top floor of his home is immaculate and has a lovely bathroom with heated floors and ample storage in the closet. There are also solar powered shades for the sky lights which make the room very dark for sleeping. The house is close to everything in Ballard and his welcome packet has a two page list of various restaurants and eateries for whatever you are in the mood for on any budget. Overall an excellent choice for airbnb. I would definitely visit again.  Brian was a great host! He went out of his way to check up on us and the room was just as described in the listing. We also loved the heated floors in the restroom. We recommend for anyone looking to stay close to everything in Seattle! The apartment offers a view of Seattle as a resident and local. It doesn\\'t offer luxury but that\\'s not always what someone is seeking. We found the location to be a little too far from downtown but Wendy gave us all the details we needed to get around so that made things easier. The area is nice and the next door coffee is amazing. You can drive to Ballard easily and the airport isn\\'t a bad drive in the morning before traffic. You\\'re not far from city necessities and Wendy offers advice as you need it. \\n\\nThere is a big dog that will sometimes hang out in the yard but it\\'s very friendly and sweet.  Nice place. A little too expensive. Bathroom was dirty and seemed like the bed sheets were slept in. Great patio view though. The location was perfect for going to pike market. We had a lovely stay at Wendy\\'s place. This is a quirky attic apartment with a lot of personality.  It\\'s a cozy, affordable option, clean enough, in a fantastic neighborhood. This listing is what Airbnb is all about. Would definitely stay there again! Needed to find an affordable place to stay in Seattle for a kickball tournament.  This place worked out great for my husband and I and two of our teammates. Communication with Wendy was easy and prompt. Beautiful view of the Olympics!! We all really liked the funky decor and even posed with the manikins for some photos.  Beds were comfortable.  You get what you see in the pics. We thought the location was perfect for us and was  in close proximity to Green Lake park where our games were. We also took some of Wendy\\'s recommendations and checked out some local spots that were in walking distance.  The only cons: Floors looked like they needed a good vacuuming but everything else was pretty clean.  I would have even done it myself but didn\\'t see a vacuum. It was a hot weekend in Seattle so a fan would have been nice, especially for my husband that sleeps super hot. (We normally bring a small fan for him but forgot to bring ours) But we made due and it is was\\r\\nstill not a deal breaker for me.  The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Listing description was accurate. Pictures need to be updated as I think the bathroom was remodeled and no motorized couch :( Wendy was out of town when we arrived, but did provide us with an alternate contact during our stay. Unfortunately, we were quite disappointed with the cleanliness level of the house. The pictures online didn\\'t match the reality. While there were lots of differences, the main ones that caused us to leave were that there were no towels available, the beds weren\\'t made (and looked slept in!), and there was dirt and debris on the floor. We ended up leaving and getting a hotel elsewhere. The next morning when we returned to take pictures (to submit to Airbnb), there were towels left (on the dirty floor!) for us. \\r\\nWe are currently working with airbnb and wendy to get a refund on our reservation and are hopeful that we can reach a reasonable and fair resolution.  Wendy made the experience super easy. She was on point, communicative, and even though she was out of town during our stay we had no problem navigating the space, access, or house rules.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood, btw, is incredible.  Best coffee shop ever next door and a really cool restaurant/ bar on the same block.  Really no problems getting into town - it helps to get to know the bus schedule.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all a great stay - the place is certainly quaint but turned out to be an ideal spot to explore the city like a local.  Nice neighborhood. Everything was accurate according to description. Balcony is a big plus!! The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Thank you, Wendy, for sharing your lovely home. Every aspect of our stay was exactly as we\\'d hoped. Cool little house, great location near Ballard restaurants/bars/brewpubs. Alex was very responsive. I\\'d rent it again next time in Seattle. Nice spacious house in a peaceful neighborhood of Seattle that is also walkable to interesting things to see and do (including very close to the zoo).  Host was communicative and we had a great stay! Easily found.  Corner of a somewhat busy street, the evenings were quiet.  Nice little home away from home. Very nice home.  Good view.  it\\'s on a quiet street, but not too far from all of the bars and restaurants in Ballard/Fremont. Varun\\'s townhouse is great and brand NEW, basically it has 3 levels where \\'basement\\' is above ground, comparing traditional Canadian house. Its quiet and beautiful. Varun was nice and flexible with our time.  Varun was very welcoming and the apartment was just as described. There is easy street parking and the house is comfortable with all the amenities you need. One thing that is different is that you have to pass through the master bedroom where Varun stays to get to the master bath, which is where the guest shower is at. Varun made me feel comfortable and was a great host. Varun\\'s place is brand new and so nice! He was the perfect host and so accommodating when my flight to Seattle was delayed. Overall fantastic experience!!  Varun was super welcoming, I highly recomended staying in his room.  Beautiful new home with great appliances. I felt very welcomed throughout my stay. I thought the neighborhood was great, especially the location to public transit. When I arrived Varun was pulling the clean new sheets out of the washer for me.  Varun was an awesome host, and super friendly! The place itself was really modern but also comfy and inviting. Definitely stay if you have the chance! I had a great stay. Walked to dinner from there. Close to my job. I enjoyed it. I look forward to staying again Great place...very modern, clean, and luxurious accommodations. Thanks Varun for making it simple and easy. The reservation was canceled 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. We were very lucky to find such sweet hosts so last minute! Yedida & Vince were so nice and accommodating. They offered toiletries and towels, invited us to join them at the Freemont Market one weekend and even made an incredible Cinco de Mayo spread while we were there. Almost wish we needed to stay longer! Easy to get around from the house. I was able to walk to the buses that go downtown and the area is nice and safe too. Cute little dog lives there too! Thanks so much for the introduction to Seattle:)) Staying with Yedida and Vince was perfect! They are fun and interesting people with great travel stories, and their house is cute and very comfortable. They were super accommodating when it came to our check-in and check-out times, and they offered us room in the fridge and a place to store our bike rack while we were traveling. Towels and toiletries were also laid out for us when we arrived. They gave us great tips for exploring their neighborhood. And they have the friendliest little dog too! Their place is the perfect place to stay for exploring Seattle! This was our first AirBNB experience, and we stayed for two nights. We were happy to find it to be a nice, clean house, and the neighborhood is fantastic, too! Dida, Vince, and Kevin were friendly and accommodating. The bedroom was comfortable and private. Also...listen up tall people like me...the shower head was nice and high!\\n\\nWe would definitely return! AHHH!!! We can\\'t speak more highly of Dida and her beautiful home.  She was super welcoming, personable, easy-going, and we felt comfortable from the moment we stepped onto the property. This is sort of cheesy, but she really makes you feel like you\\'re staying at your best friend\\'s house for a night. Not to mention, if you\\'re a dog lover like I am, you will fall in love with her little Chihuahua mix, Jacamo. The deck is so cute and peaceful, even though we didn\\'t have much time to hang out, and her husband was lovely to meet as well.  Overall, a really wonderful stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you so much for your kindness and hospitality! \\r\\n\\r\\n- Clinton and Melanie  Yedida and Vince were awesome. Super chill and accommodating! We basically just wanted to sleep in a real bed and take a real shower before heading out on a camping trip. We got just that plus warm, welcoming vibes and good conversation. Wish we had been  staying longer to enjoy their lovely home and hospitality more! I\\'ll be looking them up on my next trip to Seattle, for sure! Staying with Yedida and Vince was super relaxed and easy. Everyone was welcoming and laid back and accommodating considering our unexpected late arrival. The dog is lovely as well. It\\'s home, sweet home indeed! I was met like an old friend! Dida was very friendly, attentive, helpful, and open to talk. The house is beautiful and comfortable. The small dog, Giacomo, is very funny and always ready to play with you, but he won\\'t disturb you in any way, if you are busy.\\r\\nOverall experience is so great, that I fell sorry that I did not stay there for a few days more. Dida was a great host. Very prompt in responding and very friendly. I enjoyed my one night stay in their cozy and clean room. I was wishing I could spend more time with Dida and her family and hear about their adventures. I highly recommend staying with Dida, Vincent and Giacomo :) Great Staying here with Dida, Vince, and Kevin was awesome.  They are the friendliest, most interesting people.  I read that talking to Dida is like talking to your best friend, which I thought was an exaggeration but it\\'s definitely not.  Dida has this magic power to bring everyone together and make them comfortable and happy.  Talking to her is how talking to your family should be!  Their house has a great vibe, and Giacomo is incredibly well-behaved and unassuming.  I hope anyone looking for a place to stay chooses Dida\\'s because they will look back on it with fond memories! Amazing stay! Yadida, her husband Vince and their roommate were incredibly welcoming and helpful! It was a little hotter than usual and they did whatever they could to help cool the rooms down. The neighborhood is amazing. Next time I am in Seattle I will for sure be staying with them again!  Home sweet home-away-from home was the place I stayed for about a month while looking to relocate to Seattle. Their home was nestled in Ballard close to many cafes, restaurants and bars. The home was spacious, cozy, neat and clean. Even though, I never had the chance to  meet Yedida and Vincent (vacationing) they left explicit instructions, so I felt very comfortable maneuvering around their home.  Their roommate Kevin, was a superb host. He made me feel very comfortable and I appreciated his knowledge and recommendations about the area.  It was a pleasure to stay in this lovely home and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a stay in Seattle.  Basic accommodation. Flexible. Very good value for Money. I never actually got to meet Dida or Vince because they were out of town when I stayed there, yet they managed to make me feel welcome to their house through our online contact. I did meet Kevin and Giacomo who were both very friendly and nice.\\r\\nTheir home was just like the description says, bright and spacious in a nice neighborhood and lots of amenities within walking distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s definitely a place I would recommend anyone to stay at if you’re going to Seattle.\\r\\n The host canceled this reservation 43 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. We stayed with Dida and her better half for a night. They were super nice hosts, very responsive upfront and worked around our schedules of arrival. Giaccomo is the sweetest little dog and we wish we could have stayed longer! These hosts will make you feel right at home. Dida was warm and friendly from the moment we met. She was quick to provide local food suggestions and some tourist attractions in the beautiful town of Ballard. The house and neighborhood are totally cool too! Sunme and I loved our time in Seattle and that was largely due to Dida, Vince and Kevin. Thanks! Yedida and her husband were lovely and gracious.  They and their home were warm and welcoming - clean and inviting with great art on the walls. Yedida and Vincent were great hosts! An extremely friendly and open-minded young couple with good recommendations in terms of restaurants, bars, shops, etc. Their dog Giacomo and the house were lovely. Ballard is a very young and hip neighbourhood - perfect for young people and at the same time very close to the beach. Only 30min by bus to Seattle Downtown. Dida and her husband are cheerful and helpful for visitor. We could enjoy to go to neibor farmers market, and use bus smoothly.\\nTheir house is also clean and nice taste.  It takes 30min to go Downtown, but it\\'s not so much far.\\n\\nWe could have great experience thanks of them! My friend and I weren\\'t sure what time we\\'d arrive and Yedida made it super easy for us to let ourselves in. Her instructions were crystal clear, down to the smooches we might get from her two dogs. We stayed only one night so didn\\'t get to socialise much with out host, but she is lovely and very welcoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is located in a nice residential neighbourhood with a few restaurants within walking distance. We were able to get downtown with one direct bus. Very handy.\\r\\n\\r\\n Dida and Vince were great hosts! They were very friendly, accommodating, and welcoming. Their house is located about 10 minutes promenade from all the restaurants, cafes, and bars in Ballard. The room was clean and spacious, just as described. Their home was definitely ‘home-away-from–home” and I would highly recommend for anyone to stay with Dida and her family!  The room is very nice, with a private bathroom a very nice balcony and in a great area. Only a short drive to downtown and plenty of street parking. The whole house is very nice. It wasn\\'t super tidy but everything was clean. \\r\\nWe didn\\'t meet the host but communication was permanent, with quick responses. \\r\\nI would recommend this property to any visitors, especially if you are renting a car. Varun is a warm and approachable person. He was an excellent host to us. He made it clear that we were welcome in his home and he was thoughtfully attentive to our needs. He responded quickly to messages.\\r\\nBesides being an urban, modern showpiece, the home was clean, comfortable and spacious. It was everything that was promised. The bed was superb, the shower was hot. We slept soundly in this quiet neighborhood. \\r\\nThe location was within easy walking distance to good food and coffee. There is great fun to be had in Ballard.\\r\\nParking was always easy. Cozy home, accurate as advertised, simple, perfect for our needs.  We stayed with 2 small children, 2 & 5, and all slept comfortably in the main bedroom (queen and a pull out trundle twin).  Though the downstairs setup would be great for a slightly older pair of children or a 2nd couple.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything was clean and tidy and our host organized everything via airbnb messaging and text.  She was very responsive and accommodating, especially considering out late arrival on night 1. The location was perfect for us, right on a main artery for the neighborhood, and a 5 minute walk from both downtown Ballard (hip restaurant scene) and the D-line bus right to downtown Seattle and seattle center.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould definitely book again Delightful space, perfect for me, husband and baby. Actually very spacious for just us three, but we really liked being able to put the baby down for his nap in the separate bedroom downstairs. Clean and well-kept furnishings, plenty of closet space and easy street parking. Love the bathroom. Would like to have some pantry items like sugar/oil/salt and pepper available for those nights we might want to cook. Really nice to have the washer and dryer which we ended up using after an impromptu swim at a friend\\'s house. Grace was out of town when we arrived but it was easy to get in and she was responsive via text and email. Would stay here again - also a quick drive or walk to Ballard hot spots. Recommend. Grace is very accommodating. The property is just like the pictures....new, clean, and comfortable. The location is minutes from aurora ave and I-5. I love the variety in this area with convenient shopping and plenty of restaurant choices near by.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stayed here long term at the end of summer and returned via this site for short return trip for work. I would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend!\\r\\n\\r\\nOh plenty of free parking too! We had a great experience at Grace\\'s little place. The 2 bedrooms were just the right size for us and our toddler - the basement bedroom got a little cold but extra blankets did the trick. Her home is exactly as advertised - nothing fancy, but nice, clean, in a great neighborhood and perfect for our weekend. Grace was so easy to communicate with too. Would stay here again.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Cooley\\'s cozy home over the holidays with our two little ones (ages 3 and 1) and my mother-in-law! The basement bedroom was a great place for my mother-in-law to have some privacy of her own, and the four of us fit comfortably on the main level with the trundle bed in the master bedroom for our 3-year-old. The house was clean and sunny (we lucked out with clear skies during our visit!), a very welcoming place to come after a long day of sightseeing in Seattle. The location is awesome! Very close to Safeway and Trader Joe\\'s, and just a short drive from downtown Seattle. Thank you for a wonderful stay! Alles unkompliziert und wunderbar - vielen Dank Grace was an incredibly helpful host! She was more than happy to give us great advice on getting to and from her place as well as excellent suggestions on local places to eat, drink and must sees in Seattle. Her place was one of the nicest AirBnBs that we have stayed at in the U.S. especially considering how inexpensive it is. There was plenty of room for three of us and the whole place was super comfortable. Public transport makes it easy to get to and from downtown with bus stops less than a minute walk away from Grace\\'s. We highly recommend staying here!!! Grace has a very lovely house. It was a very comfortable stay, very clean, very inviting, and a great neighborhood. Grace was very accommodating and was very easy to work with. If we ever had a question she would answer right away. She definitely makes for a great host! Would definitely recommend! Thanks Grace! Had a lovely time at this home.  It is cute, warm and decorated nicely.  Would definitely come here again!  We loved it! This was a perfect place for us. The house is exceptionally clean and the host has provided everything you can think of. It was quite peaceful for being in an urban area. Our bed was amazingly comfortable! I would definitely stay here again.  Wonderful spot in Ballard. The home is warm, inviting, comfortable and spotless! The beds and bedding were very cosy! The accommodation was perfect for 4 women on a 3 day yoga retreat in Ballard. The location is great: a quick drive to many good shops and restaurants. We highly recommend Grace\\'s home. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur retreat started early on Friday morning, and Grace met us at the home and allowed us to leave our things. Very accommodating of her and greatly appreciated.  Grace\\'s place was perfect!  It is exactly as described. We had everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable. The location is great. You can get to just about anywhere within 30 min. Lots of great restaurants in Ballard.  The apartment was spacious and spotless. The appliances are modern and work well. Ballard is a very peaceful neighborhood but the apartment has 24h supermarkets, cafes, some restaurants and other services within walking distance. A direct bus downtown (28) has a stop one block south and there is plenty of parking space on the streets right next to the front door. Grace responded very quickly to all requests and provided us with all we asked for.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrace provided us with a \"baby kit\", including a large high quality crib, toys, books, DVD\\'s and a seat for the dinner table. It was extremely useful and saved us a lot of trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only negative was that the house is quite noisy. Traffic is not a problem but the whole floor is squeaky and so is the bed. The \"forced air\" heating makes a relatively loud noise when it blows warm air through vents in the floor. This happens several times every night and goes on for a couple minutes each time (we visited in April and the outside night temperature was around 44F). To be fair, it seems that most houses in Seattle use the same heating system, so it\\'s hard to escape it. Our friends and their child from oversea and my family (4 adults and 4 children under 10, total) stayed at Grace\\'s place over the weekend.  Grace was very flexible with our arrival time, and she made sure our families\\' stay was comfortable.  \\r\\nThe house was very clean and cared for.  We had enough beds for all of us, and everything (dishes, towels, etc.) we needed.  The location was great, too.  It made it easy for us to show our friends all the great places in Seattle.   What is important for visitors exploring any city? Location, location, location! If you are in Seattle to check out the sights such add space needle, Mariners, Seahawks, Pike St, etc, the house is perfect. Without traffic you will get to these destinations in no more than 15 min. Beyond that, the community is safe and there are as lot of places to explore to eat closer to the house. I would recommend the house as well as Grace. She was helpful with tips and always responded in a timely manner. Met the owner and she showed us the house.  The house was very clean, well equipped, and as described.  Safe neighborhood, we were able to walk to shopping and good restaurants.  We would definitely stay again. Grace was a wonderful host - easy to get in touch with. The house was very clean and exceeded my expectations. The location was perfect for us, very close to the things in Ballard and Fremont that we were there for and a great location overall. The beds were comfy, the pack and play worked great for my 5 month old son, and parking was a breeze. I\\'d stay here again without a doubt.  This place was exactly as described. We loved how central it was to everything. All of our day trips were no more thsn a 90 minute drive away. Loved the coffe bar a few blocks away, went there every morning for coffe and croissants Grace\\'s apartment was STELLAR. This was definitely one of the best airbnbs I\\'ve ever stayed in. It was SUPER clean, beautifully decorated with a minimalist feel. There was so much attention to detail. Definitely book this place--it will really impress you! Also, it\\'s just a quick 15 minute walk to the cute Ballard neighborhood and lots of other amenities. Could not have been better. Grace and her Husband were great hosts. Met us at the house and did a walk through. Gave tips on near by stores and dinning. House was very clean and as described. We were happy with the whole experience and would stay again. Thanks for a great weekend! Kevin and Peggy. Grace was good about keeping in touch, and the house was very well equipped-- everything one needs is provided. from plates and utensils to towels and sheets. The wifi worked well, and parking was ample.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the house is on a main road, we didn\\'t find the noise to be a problem at all. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not really clear from the photos that two of the beds are in the basement, so the lighting isn\\'t great. It was fine for us, and in fact we appreciated the cool air in the basement, as it was hot in Seattle when we were there. But if we were staying for an extended period of time, the darkness might have been an issue. To clarify, the hosts did the best they could do to make the rooms downstairs feel home-y and cozy, and so it\\'s not like you feel that you\\'re in a dungeon. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe stayed two nights and it was fine for us in all respects.   Great place to stay in the Ballard neighborhood.  Our first time staying in Ballard but we enjoyed it very much.  Close to the Ballard district for dining, etc. plus close to Fremont area.  House was clean and neat with everything we needed.  8th Ave. was a little bit noisy but it did not bother us at all.   We loved this home. The location was great for everything we wanted to do and see in Seattle. The home was immaculate! Grace checked in with us during our stay, and even let us know about special events going on in town. The house was very clean and had all the essentials required.\\r\\nThe house was close to my nephews place which was a good for that reason.  The cost for taxi\\'s into the city got quite expensive so we used the bus as it was alot cheaper.\\r\\nGrace was an excellent hostess and answered questions I had regarding Seattle.  \\r\\nEven though there was no air conditioning in the house the ceiling fans worked perfect.  We just so happened to be there when it was extremely warm and had no rain.  After a second stay at a different airbnb in Seattle, I am glad I have not reviewed this place yet. The two experiences were night and day!  Grace and her place are both awesome.  She was so accommodating - bringing over an extra AC unit during the heat wave, a BBQ for the 4th of July, and giving me suggestions of places to go and eat and directions several times.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house itself is clean and inviting, a great location near bus routes, ample space inside and out to enjoy, and nice beds and bedding.  It was great to feel like we were locals, enjoying our coffee on the patio or grilling out for the 4th!  There is no worry about using something that is theirs, as this truly is your place while you\\'re there - way better than staying in someone\\'s house who lives there also.  We were out and about all day long, so coming home to a nice, clean place when it was already dark was delightful.  The sun rises much earlier there, so if anything, I wished it were darker later in the basement, but I can only take that one up with nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn added surprise, especially for my almost 2 year old, was the closet full of fun toys.  This kept him entertained while he was not running around the yard and picking up rocks.  This house was ideal for us and I would highly recommend it.  Easy parking should be enough to convince you, but you might not realize that\\'s such a big deal in Seattle if you\\'re from any place where parking is not an issue. Overall fantastic stay and wonderful hosts!  Thank you! Grace was very gracious and accommodating.  We were in Seattle during an unusual hot week.  She installed a window air conditioner for us!  We found the home clean and very convenient to Ballard.  The home offered separate rooms to sleep and also a common area to enjoy a meal together.  We would definitely like to return again as we visit our daughter and son-in-law in the Ballard area. This house was a perfect place for us as a family!!! Our group included 9 people staying for 3 nights and it worked perfectly for us.  Our trip was for my parents 50th Anniversary and looking for hotel rooms was NOT cost effective ($2400 minimum).  Then a friend recommends airbnb and in comes Grace, Thank God!!!  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was cute and neat and had enough beds for all of us.  Sharing one bathroom took some scheduling but it was no problem at all.  Seattle is very active in recycling and there were specific instructions on how to make sure we did our part.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pictures shown of the house are exactly what you will see when you arrive.  When we had a slight problem with the kitchen sink someone was there in less than an hour and had the problem fixed very quickly.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGrace was great to work with when I asked for information about grocery stores, transportation (the house is right on a bus line that goes directly into the City (less than 30 minute ride) and stopped at all the places we wanted to go) and things she would suggest we do while there.  This helped us to plan our time in Seattle before our Cruise to Alaska.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are looking for a place in/around Seattle to stay I would definitely recommend Comfort in Ballard/Fremont.  The restaurants nearby had great food, anything we forgot we could pick up by walking less than 10 minutes from the house.  The house itself is very clean and homey feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you Grace!!!! \\r\\n This home in Ballard was exactly as specified! The host contacted us with instructions just prior to our stay and told us that we could contact her for anything.  The house was super clean, well appointed and had all the necessary accessories to make us feel extremely comfortable.  Due the unseasonable warm weather during the month we stayed, the hosts had actually put in a window air conditioner in the living room which definitely helped with our comfort.  The home is centrally located in a lovely neighborhood with easy access to all the things we wanted to visit.  The large upstairs bedroom was very comfortable (we didn\\'t need to use either of the two downstairs bedrooms) but did take advantage of occasionally sleeping on the living room futon which was extremely comfortable with the added comfort of the air conditioning.  The home was super clean with plenty of seating, a TV for some downtime enjoyment as well as plenty of towels, wash cloths, etc. and lots of hot water for comfy showers (great shower pressure!) and dishwashing.  We even enjoyed use of the electric outdoor grill for several meals.   We truly enjoyed the location and comfort and look forward to the chance to stay here again!  Thanks for such a comfortable stay it really made our vacation that much more enjoyable! We hope we left it as clean as we found it! We had a wonderful experience staying at Grace\\'s house.  The house was very comfortable and a perfect fit for 3 adults and 2 young children.  Separate sleeping and living areas helped getting the kids to nap and go to bed early.  Having a kitchen and laundry in the house made traveling with kids much easier.  The bathroom was very clean and spacious enough for three adults to share over our stay.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location was perfect for us.  Downtown attractions were just a short drive away.  There were shops, restaurants, and breweries within walking distance and we also found a few playgrounds close by.  Street parking was always easy to find.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrace was a great host.  She had everything cleaned and ready for us when we arrived and was close by if we were to need anything.  I would definitely recommend this house if you are looking to stay in the area. The listing was accurate and the experience seamless.  A great value for a group of people to stay.   This place was perfect for our large group. We came up for our daughter\\'s wedding and didn\\'t want to be separated into 3 hotel rooms.  There were plenty of beds for us and the locale was quite convenient for utilizing public transportation when we needed it. We took several walks to dinner and the library. The home was very clean and generously equipped with dishes, bedding, towels, washer/dryer, even an iron and ironing board, which we definitely needed! Neighborhood was centrally located - great for accessing all the popular Seattle sites. Plenty of space in the house made it easy for our two small sons to roam around. Tidy and organized place. Grace provided clear instructions for our stay and was always quick to respond to our questions.  Very accommodating. Very clean. Everything you look for when renting for a couple of days. Beautiful place perfect for a group of people. Close proximity to everything in Seattle. Thank you Grace! Grace\\'s place was exactly as pictured and described, it was the perfect spot for us to call home for 5 nights. I did not meet Grace nor did we need to contact her during our stay as everything was well marked and available for our use. Location was fantastic, easy walk into Ballard and Fremont not far down the way either.  Overall extremely happy with our stay and can honestly say this felt like a home away from home. Grace was great through the booking experience and even let us cancel a day when needed. The home was mostly how it looks in photos. One thing that was different was that the outside was completely overgrown and dying. Nothing like the photos. Also, contrary to other reviewers, the basement to be a bit dark and scary. This house is clearly a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom house, that they added 2 more “rooms” in the basement. We had 3 total adults staying in the house and we all decided to sleep in the 1 room that is in the main house because the first night when someone tried to sleep downstairs, they did not feel comfortable and just the noise from our footsteps and the plumbing upstairs was very loud downstairs. The basement has 1 tiny bedroom that a bed is stuffed into, but the other bed is just around a dark corner. The basement is also where the water heater and washer and dryer is. Do not be confused like we were that there are multiple rooms. \\r\\n\\r\\nI do not know how it is possible to stay in this house with 8 people. There is one very small bathroom and it took just 3 of us an hour to all get ready so we could all take turns in there. The plugs in the house are in weird locations, so we couldn’t bring the hair dryer into another room to do our hair so we all had to take turns in the 1 small bathroom. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, the wifi speed was incredibly slow. We were just trying to do basic internet usage, like emails and it took a long time to load anything. This was frustrating trying to get some work done at the house. \\r\\n\\r\\nBasic supplies were not available for us. There was no laundry detergent (just two empty bottles sitting on top of the machine), no toilet paper, no trash bags, no soap, etc. We didn’t expect a lot, but we expected basic items to be provided. Grace did let us know about the toilet paper, but we had to purchase everything else. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe couches were comfortable. The TV was very small and only had local channels. We never were able to find anything to watch on TV the few times we were relaxing in the house. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, when we arrived, we found a small container of weed in the kitchen. It wasn’t a big deal for us 3 adults but I would hate if I had kids with me and they had found it. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was quiet and I felt to be in a safe neighborhood. Coffee shop and grocery store nearby and walking distance to restaurants. We did have a great time in Seattle and felt this to be a comfortable place to stay, though not exactly as we had envisioned. Though I do personally like Grace and thought her to be a good host, I would not stay here again. \\r\\n Lovely place - I would highly recommend it.  Grace communicated with me prior to the trip and left us a welcome note, along with various notes throughout the home to help us navigate a new place.  She also left us hints for navigating  Seattle and shopping in the surrounding area.  Very pleased with our stay!   Grace met us when we arrived and told us of nearby groceries and great restaurants as well as very close by bus stops taking us into Seattle. We were able to text her whenever we had a question. The rental was as pictured and nicely decorated as well as very clean. The beds were all very comfortable. It was just right for two couples with the one bathroom. If you have a lot of tolerance for lots of people underfoot, it would sleep eight. The location in Ballard made it easy to explore downtown Seattle and the funky Freemont area. We liked being in Ballard and would definitely stay here again. Carol Grace made sure the house was immaculate when we arrived.  Everything sparkled and the sheets on the beds were fresh.  We loved the little notes on the fridge, and Grace was so helpful giving us directions and suggestions for groceries and restaurants in the Ballard area. (a.k.a. just down the street about a mile) We came out for a (much needed) girls trip.  Because of Grace\\'s home, we were able to see the Seattle area, go hiking, and even spend a night relaxing with a DVD.   My roommate and I stayed with Grace for a few months while in town on business. Grace met us at the door when we moved in and showed us around. She has left information on the refrigerator about nearby gas stations, grocery stores, recycling/compost/trash rules for the city etc. that were really helpful. She was very accommodating and respectful of our night shift schedule when doing yard work, etc. We really appreciated that! We only had 1 minor problem with the house and Grace had it repaired immediately. The house is so cute and incredibly clean! The location is awesome! It\\'s really close to both Ballard and Fremont areas, grocery stores, gas stations, and bus stops. There is plenty of room for guests to sleep comfortably and she has provided all of the additional linens you could possibly need. The washer and dryer were in great condition as well. Grace checked on us periodically to make sure we didn\\'t need anything. We would definitely stay with her again if we come back to town! Very nice room in good location close to public transit. Welcoming host!  Cindy is a wonderful host, not only is she very accommodating she is also a huge well of knowledge on the seattle area, and is a good conversationalist. bonus: very cute and individual cat that comes and goes, and i am not a big cat person and he won me over.  comfortable an clean room in a small likable apartment building in a neighborhood that has lots of things to do. Wonderful experience with Cindy, such a nice lady! Comfortable place, accommodating host, excellent location. What more can you ask for?!  I had a great stay here of ~2 weeks. Cindy was a kind and helpful host. The location was good, close to plenty of restaurants and public transit. The room was exactly as described. Comfortable, clean, and in a nice area. Our host was friendly and very helpful. The location was excellent in Ballard. Plenty of bus lines to wherever we needed to go in Fremont or Downtown. We even walked to some of our favorite restaurants and to the locks. Great host who knows the area. It is a great location that is very close to bud stops. Very nice and comfortable bed.  Cindy is awesome. Great communication right from the start. She was very welcoming and willing to give advice and info on things to do and see. We got to hear a little bit about her travels and experience abroad, very interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment was nice and clean. The bed was very comfy and had notably nice sheets on it. We had everything we needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ballard area is great. We really enjoyed staying in the neighborhood. Grocery stores, tons of restaurants and a few touristy things nearby to check out.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, great stay. We would highly recommend it and would definitely stay again.\\r\\n\\r\\n This is a wonderful place to stay, close to downtown Ballard, grocery stores and restaurants.  Cindy is a gracious host very helpful and knowledgeable.  The room is comfortable and quite with its own heat control. Both the room and shared living area are very clean. I definitely would stay again when in the Seattle area. Cindy was very welcoming and accommodating. Cindy made me feel very welcome and comfortable staying at her place. It is a short walk from public transit, and was very convenient for my La Marzocco training in Ballard. My first experience with AirBNB. Great location, gracious host, comfortable bed. In short, all that I needed.  Cindy was very kind and made us feel welcome in her home. Accurate description of the room, which was simple, nice, and clean. This is a great location; the Ballard neighborhood was hip and had lots to offer within walking distance as far as shows, food, and fun little shops. We enjoyed our walk to the locks and found the bus system into downtown Seattle to be very easy.  Again Cindy was a great host, fire in the fireplace, warm house and good company.  It’s my go to place in Seattle Cindy is a warm and congenial hostess.  The bed was comfy, the room clean, and the whole experience was positive.  Most nights a nice crackling fire going, and good conversation.  If I wasn\\'t in the mood for all that, I was left to my own devices.  Cindy is very in tune to the area, and if she doesn\\'t have current information about a business or restaurant, she won\\'t hesitate to research it on the internet, or ask friends or family.  Very convenient location.  Everything is within walking distance, or a close bus route if you don\\'t have a rental car. Cindy is very accommodating, Room is clean and so is the apt, nice friendly cat too. Cindy was a great communicator and her place is exactly as described. The bed was comfortable and we had everything we needed. She was a great host. The listing is located within walking distance of multiple shops, restaurants, and nightlife. We were able to comfortably walk to 6 different breweries from her doorstep. I highly recommend this place.  This was a great first experience with Airbnb! \\r\\nCindy was great and her listing was accurately presented, so was absolutely perfect! The room was comfortable and clean and looked just like the picture. The bathroom was also clean and comfortable.\\r\\nThe listing was within walking distance to the Ballard shops, as well as close to two large grocery stores and many restaurants, both chain and unique. Perfect for my travel plans. I appreciated having a kitchen (I just needed the refrigerator really) available for a few items I bought at the store, such as cream for my coffee, yogurt, etc.\\r\\nI was able to come and go as my own schedule dictated. And a few times, we had a chance to chat, which is a wonderful thing to do when traveling.\\r\\nI also had a great time with the neighborhood cat, who seems to have adopted Cindy as her human!\\r\\nThis experience has been very positive. I hope future Airbnb adventures will live up to this one! We enjoyed the time with Cindy very much. Thanks for that :).\\r\\nShe is a very warm and welcoming person and we had a few beers together.\\r\\nHer place is in a nice neighborhood and it was so easy to get down town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks again. Good night\\'s sleep in a \"Sleep Number\" bed; an easy walk to fun shops, wonderful food on Market Street and Ballard Ave.  Perfect logistics before our arrival and during our stay. She let us have our privacy and space. Our experience was better than staying at an expensive hotel. She was very helpful with information on public transportation and rental cars. It was a short and pleasant stay. Cindy was nice. The room was the larger one in her apt., clean and enough space for my two large suitcases. I needed a room in Ballard, Seattle. Her place is conveniently located in a safe neighborhood, close to Market st., a large Safeway supermarket (3 mins walking), and plenty of restaurants. I really enjoyed our chat. She offered me simple breakfast and a ride to my meet up point, first thing in the morning on a Sat. I really appreciated it!  Cindy is a great and friendly host. The room looks exactly as in the picture, clean and neat. It is a cozy room in a great neighbourhood. There are a lot of places to explore in ballard areas. The public transport is readily available too. It was a pleasant experience to stay in her place.  I stayed with Cindy to take a weekend course at the Swedish hospital. It was about a 10-15 min walking distance and I never needed to drive since great shops and food are very close by. It was quiet, I felt safe and the whole experience was very easy! I highly recommend staying here since 3 nights  with Cindy was cheaper then one night in downtown. Our stay with Cindy was great. We will be moving out to Seattle in the fall and Ballard was at the top of our list as far as potential neighborhoods to live: the location was perfect for exploring and getting a sense of the neighborhood. Cindy was helpful in our exploration of the city (thanks for the maps!) and was very accommodating. The sleep number bed was definitely a highlight: we slept like rocks. We very much enjoyed chatting with Cindy and were overall very happy with the experience. We left excited to move out in the fall! Also noteworthy: parking was incredibly easy.  It\\'s like staying with an auntie you have never met. The apartment is basic but clean.  It\\'s not the lap of luxury, but it fit my needs perfectly and would stay there again.  It was just great! Cindy is awesome! She´s very chill and helpful! It was our first time in Seattle and she left us some flayers-info on the desk to lookout during our stay. She also gave us several tips and places to go to. Besides that, she was very nice to us from the moment of arrival ´till we left. I really didn´t want to go, she´s the kind of person who you would like to continue talking to. Also, the bed is delightful!!!  Cindy was an amazing host and is probably one of the nicest people I\\'ve ever met. She gave great recommendations on what to check out in Seattle and the local Ballard area. The apartment was clean and in a great location. Overall, great experience and will definetly stay again! Cindy was a great host ! She let us feel home and gave us good local advices. The bedroom is large and comfortable, common areas were clean and functional. The location is very good, in a quiet neighborhood but near Ballard and Fremont that are fancy and hipster-style areas with many bars and restaurants and only 20 minutes by bus to downtown.\\r\\nI recommend for a stay in Seattle ! We had an excellent time at Cindy\\'s! The room was very clean and the sleep number bed was really comfortable! Cindy was accommodating and responsive. Overall had a great stay! There aren\\'t enough words to describe how great of a host Cindy is. I stayed here for five nights with my girlfriend.  Cindy was an absolute delight. Her place is a 10 minute walk to Ballard\\'s restaurants, bars. Getting to other parts of the city is easy due to the proximity to bus lines. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis place is an absolute steal!\\r\\n\\r\\n Cindy was very welcoming and helpful! Everything was exactly what we had hoped for in a beautiful and convenient location!  Cindy is super chill and cool! Nice room, clean bed (the softest sheets), fresh towels, and complementary breakfast. Her place is within walking distance to grocery stores, restaurants, shops, and bars in Ballard. I visited to look for an apartment and found a place in the neighborhood.  Cindy was a great host and her house was very nice!  The room was exactly how it appeared in pictures and was very clean.  Cindy was also great and went out of her way to make our stay comfortable.  The neighborhood is in a great location within walking distance to plenty of restaurants.  The bus to downtown is only a five minute walk and is very convenient.  It is about 20 minutes to downtown by bus, but we enjoyed the neighborhood feel of her area.   Cindy was a wonderful host! Very flexible and very accommodating. She lives in a great area, easily walkable to downtown Ballard. We enjoyed our stay! Cindy was a very friendly and helpful host who went out of her way to accommodate us. We greatly enjoyed our conversations with her. Her apartment is located in a great neighborhood with many restaurants and major bus lines close by.  Cindy war sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich.\\r\\nAlles war sehr gut organisiert (so bekamen wir zb zwei Schlüssel für die Wohnung). Kann diese Unterkunft im Preis- und Leistungsverhältnis nur empfehlen. Auch ließ Cindy 24 Stunden den Ventilator laufen, da es sehr heiß war. Geschäfte sind in der unmittelbaren Nähe sowie Cafés und Co...\\r\\nVielen Dank \\r\\nCindy Cindy\\'s apartment was just as advertised and very clean.  We enjoyed our stay with her.  We would stay with her again. Our expeience was just as advertised.  The place is simple, but very clean and comfortable.  Cindy was very flexible and accomidating.  A pleasant surprise was the Wi-Fi which was suprisingly hi speed from my experience of similarly priced Airbnb.  I clocked it at 15 Mps, more than enough for streaming movies and uploading photos Super friendly host with lots of good suggestions for where to go in Seattle. Generous and welcoming- she even took our laundry out of the dryer! Can\\'t recommend her enough. Cindy was a great host, accommodating, and had great advice in terms of where to go. Bed was extremely comfortable and the place was always quiet. A very relaxed and chill atmosphere. Cindy was available to help us with all of our requests. Her home is such a great location near Ballard and Freemont. I couldn\\'t recommend her more.  Cindy was really welcoming and accommodating to us. She gave us lots of tips on things to do in the neighbourhood and in Seattle. The room was really clean, had a great bed, and nice towels for us to use. Her house is really clean and tidy- with a good shower! She offered us coffee in the mornings and was very friendly.  The house is located close to a bus line so very convenient for going into town, there is a supermarket very near by and the neighbourhood has lots of nice restaurants. We would stay with Cindy again if we were in Seattle! Cindy was wonderful- she made us feel very welcome and the apartment is in a great location; we were even able to keep cool during the heat wave. We had the perfect stay.   Cindy made us feel right at home.  Everything was the way she described it would be.  We appreciated the WiFi, the cleanliness of the room and entire house, the use of her kitchen in the morning, muffins, bagels, coffee, tea, etc.  The bus was only a walk around the block away and a Safeway store (groceries) is just another block away.  The buses are really affordable and run every 15 minutes, so there are no worries in that regard.  We explored the Fremont area with ease, doing our own walking tour using the guides Cindy provided.  We walked down to the beautiful Ballard Locks and enjoyed all the shops along the way.  The Locks and the whole area around them is well worth visiting.  Cindy was always there to answer any of our questions and we felt very privileged to have stayed with her.  She is extremely generous and as friendly a person as you are likely to meet.   We spent 3 days in Cindy\\'s  house , everything was ok the room and the bathroom were large and very clean. Cindy was a really kindly and helpfull host. She gave us a lot of  information about the city and a great help when we needed it.  The room was as described and Cindy was a great host. Thank you! We had a great experience staying with Cindy while visiting our son in Seattle.  As other reviewers have stated, the apartment is clean and comfortable with a dual-control sleep number queen-sized bed.  The pictures and description accurately define the experience.  Cindy was very responsive to our inquiries, made us feel comfortable from the moment we arrived, and generously shared the common areas of the apartment with us.  The apartment is located in the highly desirable neighborhood of Ballard, a very safe and walkable area.  You can easily access the downtown area with public transportation.  The Rapid Transit D-line stop is just 2 blocks away and will take you to Seattle Center or Pike Place in less than 15 minutes without needing to transfer.   We look forward to sampling all of the different neighborhoods as we plan our future trips to Seattle but would not hesitate to stay with Cindy again. As most will tell you, Cindy was helpful in advice on how to get around  with tips on where to go as well as brochures for us to leaf through. We happened to arrive shortly after her apple cobbler came out and she was very generous in offering it to us even with ice cream--how could we say no? She also had english muffins and other breakfast-y/snack-y foods and condiments for us to use, as well as water and towels waiting for us in the room. The area was very easy to get around to other places and fun to hang around as well--I really like Ballard and staying with her, especially for my first Airbnb experience. She\\'s a world traveller and has some cool things to say if you get past any shyness you might have. Highly recommended spot! Cindy and Guy were so nice and very welcoming. They were happy to give us tips for our stay in Seattle. The room was very clean and big, the bed was comfortable and the shower was great. Ballard neighborhood is very nice we went to the sunday farmers market and to the ballard locks. Public transportation is great you have busses every ten minutes or so in a few blocks walking distance. We truely recommend staying at Cindy\\'s house! Cindy was a great host, and made us feel very welcome in her home!  The neighborhood is nice and quiet, but is close to lots of interesting stuff in Ballard.  If you have a car, there is plenty of on street parking nearby. Staying with Cindy was great. She was welcoming and immediately hospitable. The place was as advertised and she responded quickly to any questions or concerns over air bnb. Her home is in a great location. Cindys home was clean and and cozy, the bed was very comfortable. Overall, my wife and I would definitely stay with her the next time I\\'m in Seattle!! It was my first time in Seattle and frankly it couldn\\'t have been better. Cindy and her folks (one of which has four legs and red hair) are lovely and always in for a nice chat, but also very understanding with people who, like me and my mate, were on and off the house for working reasons on a regular basis. The house is a little jewel, the room is very clean and spacious. No noise, no nasty neighborhood. Cindy is a splendid host willing to make people at ease. The house is just minutes away from downtown Ballard (round 10 mins walk) and very very close to at least 3 bus lines to downtown Seattle. So, no need to struggle for transport, which is definitely a plus if there is no car available. A few spots for last minute shopping (Safeway, Wallgreens...) are just round the corner. I would recommend this place to anybody wanting to stay in Ballard. Which honestly is the best place to stay in Seattle:)\\r\\n Easy, pleasant, neat and clean.  Neighborhood is nice, but parking is limited. Good tour, including available breakfast items, how to use coffee pot. She allowed us to come in early to leave our bags before sightseeing on our first day. The location was great for proximity to good bus to downtown (rapid D) and the good restos & shopping in both old Ballard & the Ballard market, which has good carryout. Cindy made it very easy to get the key even though I arrived before she got home and she was very welcoming when we met later that evening. She even provided some simple breakfast foods to complete the BnB experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room is quite nice, the bed is very comfortable, and the whole place is fairly quiet. The apartment is just two blocks from great transit options to get you straight to downtown quickly and is an easy walk to some really great spots for food and entertainment in Ballard. Wonderful host provide us with good breakfast and help us book taxi to the airport. Very clean room and change tower without us asking. Very helpful and friendly, highly recommend anyone to stay with Cindy.  Great neighborhood to stay in with lots to do. Guy and Cindy are great hosts and made our stay very pleasant. They gave us some good recommendations for things to see and places to eat in the area. It was great to have breakfast items in the morning as well. Highly recommend.  Cindy made me feel at home immediately.  The bed and room are very comfortable.  I loved having coffee in the morning, and everything was very clean.  I walked everywhere, it\\'s a fantastic location.   Our stay at Cindy\\'s home was comfortable and inviting. It\\'s conveniently located with easy street parking. The Sleep Number bed was excellent and the room was cozy. Cindy provided a great assortment of breakfast pastries and teas to get our morning started right!  het kan niet beter 100 procent  a 10 pumpkin is lovely  a good b and b\\nwe will come back\\nleuke buurt van Ballard We enjoyed our stay with Cindy. She is a very accommodating host. We will stay with her again Cindy is lovely! She and her home are both warm and comforting. The bed is also incredible! She had great suggestions for great restaurants and things to do around the area. I would definitely suggest staying here! Cindy and Guy were great hosts. They left out food and coffee for us in the morning. The shared bathroom was never an issue. We kind of kept to ourselves and they were respectful of that. We also ended up needing to bring our puppy with us last minute and Cindy was very accommodating.  Cindy was very welcoming during my stay at her place. The place is just as described in the apartment\\'s profile. Super clean, the cat is very nice, and her boyfriend was also welcoming. Every morning, there was breakfast for us if needed and she had let me use her laundry detergent for a load of washing when it was needed. My friend and I had a great cozy time here. The bus stop to downtown is literally 5 min walking distance. Takes about 30 minutes to Pike Public Market. It\\'s a super close walk (5-10 mins) to Ballard\\'s downtown where you can check out some bars, coffee shops, and farmers market on the weekend. Safeway is in walking distance if you needed anything. Overall, great experience, cozy place, cozy room, and the heater was money when it was cold! :) Having a place to stay close to our children in Ballard was a godsend. Cindy\\'s apartment was clean, close and comfortable.  We had a really nice stay at Cindy\\'s room, and felt welcomed. The room and residence were clean and easy to feel comfortable in. Great location with lots of access to fun things to do nearby. They told us about picking up the D-Line bus which had a nearby stop, and knowing that was very helpful. I\\'d be happy to stay here again. Kim was great and responsive to meeting up to handoff the key, provide the address, etc.  This was my first Airbnb experience and I was a single female traveling alone and felt very safe at Kim and her roommate\\'s place. I loved staying with Kim.  She was a great host and the retro vintage house is exactly as advertised.  My room had a private bathroom which made the stay even better.  Highly recommended! Kim was warm, friendly, and real. Thanks, Kim! The room I rented was big and clean. It had its own bathroom with shower! I liked the diverse pictures and sculptures through the place.  And I guess I like short sentences.  I did not meet Kim during my visit. I stayed in her room while she was out of town. The room is nice and the bathroom and shower were fine. I only briefly met the other roommates.  Great location, easy parking, private entrance -- nothing to not love about the space. Very neat and clean, Sara was very accommodating and available but not intrusive. Highly recommended! Sara\\'s basement apartment is a great base from which to explore Seattle. Ballard and Fremont, two very cool neighborhoods, are well within walking distance and are definitely worth seeing. The bus to downtown picks up and drops off only a few blocks away.\\r\\n\\r\\nSara herself was a nice host, letting us have our privacy but being available for questions or concerns. We did run into some issues with the toilet in the basement apartment--it functioned the entire time, but we needed to refill the tank manually a few times. Sara was very responsive, however, fixing the issue the very next day after we let her know.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, a good place to stay for travelers on a budget.  This experience was great. The basement apartment was exactly what I expected and all the little details were there including coffee filters and olive oil.  Sara\\'s house is in an area of Ballard that consists of well-tended and landscaped private homes. The entrance to the apt could accessed by a walk from the front or, conveniently off an alley, large enough in which to drive a car. The entrance was through a clean garage that is pass-protected. The apt was clean and generous for the price with a nice-sized, airy bedroom, middle room and small, full kitchen. Since I was out with friends or family most of the time, I hardly saw my host. She did, however communicate with me most adequately by text and email.\\r\\n   The house is only a few blocks from Ballard\\'s main streets, NW Market St and 15th Ave NW. If I did not want to use Uber, I was able to reach Belltown, Downtown, Utown, Fremont, Capitol Hill, et. al. with nearby public transportation. There\\'s a park and several pleasant brew-pubs nearby.\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Had a great stay at Sara\\'s place. Scandinavians will feel especially welcome in this neighborhood, where they\\'re flying our flags! Highly recommended. The neighborhood was great. Very quiet. Buses within walking  distance. Sara even left a paper telling us about places in the neighborhood. Market right down the street. Another store the other way within wslking distance. This stay was a gift to my dai\\r\\nUtter and new son in law.  Theys were met with a card and a bOttle of champagne to celebrate! They were pleased with the accommodations and said the house was neat, and clean. The basement apartment was exactly as expected from the pictures we saw online, and has everything needed for our stay. It has several nearby public transportation to reach several areas from Seattle. Sarah was a great host, very helpful and very responsive by email. The apartment was mostly clean, however we did have a problem with several spiders in the bedroom when we arrived. Also, the garage door was not very clean. Nevertheless, Sarah  provided everything necessarily for us to clean.  Emiliya was a great hostess and a lovely lady. She had thought of everything and told me what I needed to know, through our messages and phone calls. I Had no trouble at all in finding the place, checking in, dropping luggage or finding things like the hairdryer and other handy items. The place is exactly as described, very attractive, quiet, comfortable and within easy walking distance of Ballard downtown.  It was a really pleasant stay and the next time I am in town I will definitely book it again. I couldn\\'t be more pleased. Staying withEmiliya has worked out perfectly. She is an amazing host who is attentive to your needs but also respects your privacy. She offers coffee and food daily which is really nice, and checks in periodically to make sure everything is going ok. The room is clean and bright as pictured, and the attached private bathroom is big with a great shower. The location in Ballard is great. Inside is private and quiet, but you are also very close to the bus, shopping and downtown. I liked staying here so much I extended my visit. Highly recommended!  Emiliya was welcoming, communicates well, and the place is nice. The location was perfect, just a couple of blocks from my friend\\'s house. I used it as a base to go out to the San Juan islands, so didn\\'t spend much time checking out the neighborhood, though. Emiliya was a great host, very kind and considerate. The room is great quiet, cute with an attached bathroom and in a great neighborhood. If you stay with Emiliya you must try Morsel right down the street for breakfast!  Emiliya was a wonderful and inviting host, and I loved this little room! I was only there for one night, so I did not see Emiliya very much, but when I did she was so kind and welcoming. The pictures are very accurate and the space and bed were very comfortable. Emiliya has provided everything you might need, as well as some things I would not have even thought of! This was an excellent experience. The room has everything you might need: microwave, small fridge and kettle. The best thing about this room is location. It is next to the rapid-bus line D, which take you to downtown in 15-20 minutes. There is also supermarket opened 24 hours 5 minutes away.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did see Emiliya only few times as I went out quite early and back quite late, but she was a nice and considerate host, make sure I have pleasant stay. Overall, I highly recommended this room!! My stay (one week) at Emiliya\\'s went perfectly.  Just the right balance of attentiveness and personal space.   She makes the perfect hostess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room, house and neighborhood are just as she describes.  The cost was very fair.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can recommend you stay at Emiliya Lane\\'s Ballard Art. I didn\\'t see much of Emiliya, mostly because our respective schedules had us out and about frequently, but my conversations with her indeed made me feel very welcome.  She was very attentive and often asked if I had everything I need.  The house is located at the corner of two quiet side-streets in Ballard, but a short walk to a main thoroughfare where you can catch a bus to downtown, or another bus towards the U-District (I strongly recommend the OneBusAway app for real-time departures).  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room itself is comfortable, quiet, has plenty of storage space, its own bathroom with plenty of toiletries in stock, and a microwave.  The paintings on the walls were a nice touch.  I made good use of the sliding glass door to keep the room cool on the warm days.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely stay here again on a future trip to Seattle.     The room is lovely and clean, and it has its own washroom with everything you need (hairdryer is available when asking). The place is 2 mins walk to bus stop, which takes you about 20-25 mins to Seattle downtown area. There is also a safeway by 10 mins walk from the house, and you can buy ORCA card there. \\r\\n  Emiliya is a super nice person that makes you feel at home. If you have anything unsure, just text her. On my last day of stay, she invited me to have a cup of French coffee, and we chat for a while. I can tell that Emiliya has a strong passion for her life from the decoration of the house, and she is also willing to share her experience. at last, the price is very fair for a short stay.\\r\\n  I strongly recommend Emiliya\\'s room. It is not only a room for stay, but it is more like a great way to know new people as well as new experience. By the way, Emiliya loves Tea ;) The room was great. Had everything I needed (and more). Emiliya was a very accommodating host. I\\'d definitely look to stay here again if I come back to Ballard! Staying at Emiliya\\'s was a perfect experience.  She was very warm and welcoming.  The room and amenities were as described.  The area was quiet, felt safe, was close to public transportation, food and restaurants.  Emiliya is very friendly and accommodating. Description is accurate. Emiliya was the perfect host! I was in Seattle for 5 days to do some hiking in the surrounding areas and everything was prepared for me when I arrived. The room was clean and comfortable, and having access to the kitchen and laundry was a huge plus. Emiliya provided quick responses whenever I had any questions, and was always available if I needed any help. Would definitely stay with her again when I\\'m in Seattle! I had a nice stay with Emiliya. The room was comfortable and quiet, with a private bath and nice light from the patio. The condo is just off the D line, so quite easy access. It was perfect for my visit to Ballard! This spot was a good suburban location for staying in Seattle. Quiet neighborhood with lots of parking only a 15 minute drive to the downtown. The room was a good size to share and the private balcony was a plus! We never met Sarah during our stay but she was very responsive when I messaged her. Her other roommate Kim was very nice and welcoming. Would definitely recommend this groovy artist studio to anyone who wants a relaxing stay in Seattle! Shawn delivered all as promised. Nice place clean comfortable. ( New Sheets ! ) \\r\\nThanks Shawn. \\r\\nI recommend this place it\\'s a good location and perfect for a couple getaway. \\r\\n\\r\\nStuart.  This is truly a great place to stay. The cottage is absolutely beautiful and very comfortable and homey. It is a nice walk to downtown Ballard and an easy drive to other fun places.  Shawn was fantastic and ensured our stay was great with maps of the area and bikes to use to get around. I would definitely recommend!!! This is a wonderful home in a great location. Me and my guest had planned to explore more of the Seattle area, but there was so much going on in Ballard that we spent most of our time there. \\nI can honestly say we did not want for anything staying at this cottage. We had everything we needed. There is a beautiful  spacious deck where we enjoyed our meals. The home was comfortable and complete for all our needs. \\nThe location was ideal. Walking distance to several restaurants, coffee shops and a Trader Joe\\'s. Being a fan of craft beers it was great to have at least three breweries within a 10 minute walk. \\nShawn was a great host. He was accommodating in every way possible. He was available for questions and was very responsive before and during our stay. \\nIf AirBNB is designed to make it easy for travelers to live like locals then my stay was the perfect example of that experience. If you are going to Seattle, I highly recommend that you stay at this quaint cottage. You will not be disappointed. Shawn was the perfect host . This is a very charming cottage with all the modern amenities , it has everything you need , even a washer and dryer !! The bed was comfortable and the place was super clean . If you want to visit Seattle this is a great location , close to everything but quiet and peaceful . Shawn was super responsive to any and all questions . Airbnb was made for places like this.\\r\\n Beautiful home, lots of light, close proximity to the restaurants, bars and shopping in downtown Ballard. The house is in wonderful condition and is very well kept and furnished. Relaxing place to come back to. The bikes were a great asset to go exploring the neighborhood! Shawn was great! Very friendly and responsive to all of my questions. The cottage is beautiful--you can tell that he\\'s a designer. Would definitely recommend! This was my first airbnb experience, so I didn\\'t know exactly what to expect, but Shawn was helpful and communicative all along the way which was a big help for a novice like me. \\r\\n\\r\\nI arrived and the space was immaculate which is really important to me! The cottage is just as cute as in the photos. Shawn leaves a thorough list of items to help make your stay easier and enjoyable. The neighborhood was quite peaceful, easily accessible to/from the downtown Seattle area (though I think Seattle in general might just be a little hard to navigate your first or second time so make sure you have a map or good directions if driving), and I was able to travel around Ballard by bicycle (another huge plus--thanks to Shawn for making bikes available). \\r\\n\\r\\nBallard is great and has so much going! Lots of coffee shops/restaurants/bars/activities. I didn\\'t have time to explore the bars/restaurants much, but I did get to practice yoga a few times at Kula and had lunch at a tea shop before I took off. Kula is just one of many studios in the area, but I really enjoyed the instructors there. Just outside of the immediate center of town, and still easily biked to, there are the Chittenden Locks; I highly recommend you go! Very beautiful botanic gardens and you can watch as boats enter and leave the locks. Really cool!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne last thing about Ballard: so many amenities! I am from the east, and was pleasantly surprised that both my bank and cell phone provider had branches nearby to Shawn\\'s. My phone was actually on the fritz so I was lucky to have that resource right there to help me out in a bind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, a really great trip!! A stay at Shawn\\'s fishermans cottage was way beyond our expectations. The location was perfect,close to everything, yet away from heavy traffic and noise.\\r\\nThe home is lovely, roomy, and very comfortable. The private \"crows nest\" front deck was enjoyed both mornings and evenings. Shawns response to texts were prompt and considerate.\\r\\nShawn has done a beautiful job of making our stay one we will always remember! Shawn was right on it , responded quickly to our interest in his place and to accepting our rservation, he gave us definite directions on how to get to the cottage and get in...told us of proximity to ourdaughters and advised of bikes and the gasgrill....it was a great place to stay. The 1903 Modern Cottage was cute as a button and neat as a pin!  A really nice place to stay - all the comforts of home and it felt very welcoming.  We enjoyed the neighborhood atmosphere, Shawn left us all sorts of information about the area - things to do, places to go. He was in contact whenever we needed him. We would recommend and hope to be back. Cool little cottage that\\'s even cuter than in the pictures. Ballard is a fantastic neighborhood and this house is within walking distance of everything. Shawn made my stay painless, with lots of little thoughtful touches like providing maps and even a bicycle pump! Only regret is that I was out enjoying Seattle so much that I didn\\'t get to spend more time at this place! Shawn\\'s cottage was extremely cozy and comfortable, with wonderful architectural details and decorating. It\\'s obvious a lot of thought was put into making it a home. And it\\'s located near everything we love in the Ballard neighborhood. There were several grocery stores nearby - Trader Joe\\'s, Fred Meyer, a Whole Foods - so we were able to make use of the kitchen space. And to eat on the wonderful patio/deck, when it wasn\\'t raining. But we also enjoyed many meals out at fantastic restaurants nearby. This was a great home to stay in and Shawn was a very helpful host. He gave bus directions when we needed them and was accommodating with checking in and out. The neighborhood was peaceful and fun but within walking or biking distance to shops and restaurants in both Fremont and Ballard. It was also easy to get to a bus and go downtown. Highly recommended! Shawn was an excellent host, even getting an iron and ironing board for me when I asked if he had one at the house. He made us feel very welcome, and left a detailed guide to the house and maps to Seattle.  Both Shawn and his place were great.  Had very clear instructions for us and communicated well if we needed something.  Ballard is also great with lots of places to eat/drink.  Highly recommend staying here.   Wonderful place!  Stylishly decorated, beautiful kitchen, lovely front deck.  Best of all, the house is located minutes from a very cool shopping district with lots of wonderful restaurants and boutiques.  Shawn was such a gracious host! His place was cozy and comfortable, the perfect home base to explore Seattle. Make sure you use the bikes, we did and the city is so bike friendly! We did not use the kitchen since there were so many great restaurants in the Ballard area, but it looked well equipped. His neighbor was so nice and welcoming also! We enjoyed our stay so much and would stay again when we return to the city! Thanks Shawn :) I had a great time.  Shawn\\'s place was very clean and updated. It has full kitchen, comfortable couch, lots of natural lighting, a lot of interesting objects. I enjoyed looking through them.  The washer/dryer was a bonus.  All the spaces were well designed including the tankless water heater.  I especially liked the desk area.  I could just sit there and look out the window.  We enjoyed the deck area, sipping wine and just enjoying the sunset. Very comfortable and inviting place.  Thank you, Shawn. Shawn was an absolutely fantastic host.  In addition to having an architecturally interesting, cozy, clean home in a safe neighborhood, Sean is a great guy to boot.  His recommendations for the Ballard neighborhood were spot on, and we enjoyed taking out the bikes he left for us.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTerrific Airbnb experience, thanks Sean. Shawn\\'s place is exactly as described and pictured. The location suited us perfectly. Easy to navigate, and with easy access to downtown Seattle etc. Great to stay in a place with character, which helped it to feel like a home away from home. Shawn was great in recommending local restaurants and things to do, and the whole reservation/trip went very smoothly. Thanks Shawn!  Very nice little cottage in Ballard, about 15 minute walk to where shops/restaurants/farmer\\'s market are.\\r\\nIt was very clean and tidy when we arrived, and it has everything you need for your stay (including maps of Seattle). \\r\\nAnd it was easy to get in touch with Shawn when we had questions. I found the little house very comfortable. 15 minute walk from Ballard which was ok. The house was clean. I enjoyed using the turntable. I bought some albums to add to the collection. I felt safe. It was my first stay using Airbnb, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the experience!  Shawn\\'s cottage was so picturesque and even more lovely in person.  He was great communicating during the reservation process and checked in throughout my stay to make sure everything was great!  I truly felt at home and got a different Seattle experience than the typical hotel stay. Loved everything about Shawn\\'s Ballard Cottage & would stay again in a heartbeat! Thank you so much Shawn! Your home is so clean, beautiful and conveniently located. My mom and I really enjoyed the large outdoor terrace and the open layout inside. Hope to come again soon -- \\r\\n\\r\\nHighlights: Beautiful design, great kitchen, massive deck, hints of salt air on the balcony, view of the open sky over Ballard, walkable area, express bus stop two blocks away, great coffee at Java Jahn\\'s...  Shawn\\'s cottage was a great place for us: roomy, very well-designed and decorated, spacious kitchen with everything we needed, comfy bed, and even a laundry room. Shawn was easy to communicate with, and the space was super clean and homey, with lots of personal touches and art. Ballard has a neighborhood feel, with some light industrial/warehouse bits (complete with nano-breweries, taprooms, and a great barbecue - don\\'t miss Bourbon and Bones), and easy access to public transportation (just 20 minutes or so to downtown via bus). Walk up to the Ballard Farmers Market if you\\'re there on a Sunday; it\\'s amazing! Thanks, Shawn - we had a great weekend. Already missing this cozy modern cottage in one of my favorite parts of Seattle. The large deck and big windows give you a great feel for the ever changing weather of Seattle and its dramatic sunsets. The space was very clean and the art work was so unique and just a general treat to be surrounded in.  A perfect respite! Also Shawn was very responsive and although we didn\\'t meet in person he was a great host.  Highly recommend this spot!  Shawn was a great host and his cottage was the perfect home away from home! Shawn kept in touch and provided all of the necessary information for our arrival. The cottage was such a warm and inviting space! It has a fantastic deck, which we took advantage of during the warm fall days. The living space was comfortable and we loved Shawn\\'s design sense. The cottage was an easy walk to the center of Ballard, where there were tons of restaurants, bars and shops. We loved our stay at the cottage - thanks Shawn! This house is just as awesome as it looks in the pictures. Its on a nice secluded block yet close to everything. Me and my girlfriend had a great time staying here for a week. Everything was clean and tidy when we showed up, and Shawn is a great host, giving us all the privacy we could hope for. I would most definitely stay here again! Shawn\\'s home was a very cozy spot located near the Burke Trail, Downtown Ballard and more!  We thoroughly enjoyed the location and the home.  The laundry was a great added bonus and the bikes were an amazing addition as well!  Copper the cat (next door neighbors) was on the porch most mornings and was a great host as was Shawn. The cottage was perfect for my 3 nights in Seattle.  Quiet, clean with everything necessary to make me immediately feel at home.  The gas fireplace was a really nice way to quickly heat the cottage, too.  Location was also great for a nice walk to the restaurants and shops in Ballard and a short drive to Fremont.  \\r\\n\\r\\nShawn was an awesome host too, with great communication and very quick with responses.  At one point I thought I\\'d locked myself out of the cottage and Shawn responded immediately, and even though I didn\\'t b/c the key I had worked both locks Shawn came over anyway to be sure I had no troubles getting back in. Shawn\\'s house was even better than I expected. It was impeccably clean, beautiful, and artistic. The location was good -- just a quick Uber ride from anywhere in the city. Shawn was a fantastic host, helpful and easy to reach. I can\\'t wait to come back soon! We LOVED our stay at Shawn\\'s cottage. It\\'s so cozy & delightfully decorated... we immediately felt fully at home here! The house is situated in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to coffee shops, restaurants, and everything the charming Ballard & Fremont districts have to offer. This will be my first choice for future Seattle stays.  We had a great time getting around Seattle by foot from Shawn\\'s place. There are 2 bus lines pretty close to the house, a 24 hour grocery store, and shopping along Ballard Ave and Market is within a mile.  We took the B-G trail over to Queen Anne for brunch one morning, explored the city all day, and came home to this cozy cottage to relax. Shawn\\'s place was great, he was awesome about recommending local breweries, and ensuring i felt super welcome during my stay. The front porch was perfect to hang out on in the mornings, and the inside was cozy and modern.  We had a lovely stay at Shawns cottage.  This little green house is so cosy and had everything we needed.\\r\\nWe arrived late in the evening so didn\\'t get to meet our host but he made it easy for us to gain access.  The house was warm when we got in which was nice as it had been cold all day.\\r\\nShawn was very helpful leading up to our stay at his place.  He checked in with us several times to make sure that everything was going according to plan so we never had any worries at all.\\r\\nThe location was great for us.  Street parking was fairly tight as there is not a lot of room between cars when they are parked on either side of the road.  We didn\\'t have any problem finding a space though.\\r\\nThe area around the cottage is a mix of older houses and newer places going up to revitalize the neighbourhood. There were plenty of food options within walking distance.  We took one of Shawn\\'s suggestions for a bbq meal and have no regrets at all because it was delicious and well worth the 10 minute walk.\\r\\nI would not hesitate to recommend Shawn\\'s place to my friends. A beautiful little cottage on a quiet street.  The house is nicely decorated and comfortable for a stay.  The kitchen is particularly well stocked with everything you could need for cooking.  The cottage is set up from the street, with a very private deck that was wonderful for sitting in the early spring sun! Tremendous quiet and relaxing stay. Great tucked away part of Ballard. Easy to walk or bike to the more populated areas, but I enjoyed being just a bit away from the main drag. Never met Shaun which is too bad because he was great help and a good host from afar. This place was great, coming back soon for sure. Shawn\\'s home is the perfect basecamp for exploring Seattle--close access to a bustling part of town and public transportation, but private, quiet and cozy. Shawn\\'s excellent sense of style is inspiring and inviting, and we felt at ease immediately. Delicious heat from a gas-powered stove drove away the typical Seattle Spring chill, while a clean and ship-shape kitchen invited us to stay in and cook together. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough we didn\\'t get to meet, Shawn\\'s notes were thorough, giving us the guidance to be good guests. We appreciated the privacy and the comfort of a home away from home.  Shawn\\'s Cottage in Ballard was perfect for our stay in Seattle. It was super comfortable and private, and his house has so much character; a true gem in this neighborhood.\\nShawn is a great host and was very receptive to any questions and info for the house and the neighborhood. I would highly recommend staying at this cottage and exploring all that Ballard has to offer. I stayed at Shawn\\'s cottage for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend and it was a perfect jumping off point for exploring the city, cycling and eating and drinking our way through Ballard. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment itself was clean and cozy, extremely quiet and comfortable. The deck was an awesome place to hang out and the neighbor cat was super cool and friendly. The immediate neighborhood is great - quiet, tree lined streets and very accessible to everything we wanted to do in Seattle. If you\\'re coming with bikes, there is great access to miles and miles of bike paths. \\r\\n\\r\\nI only met Shawn briefly, but he was also super cool and friendly and he sent plenty of good recommendations prior to our stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, if I lived in Seattle, I could see myself living at the cottage. I would not hesitate to stay here on future trips to Seattle.  Shawn was an excellent host from start to finish. He was very responsive to my questions in advance of my booking request & subsequent checkin, and he left a detailed & very helpful House Manual on the kitchen counter, along with plenty of travel guide materials to help direct me to the best of everything in Seattle. The property was very comfortable and had all essentials I could ask for.. plenty of space to relax, work, in-unit laundry, full kitchen, etc. All in all it was a five star property and a five star experience! This is only my third Airbnb stay, but it will be hard to top my stay at Shawn\\'s Ballard cottage. I arrived to a pile of information on attractions, restaurants and getting around town which. I got every morning started listening to KEXP (the best radio station in the country) on his stereo. I used his bike to enjoy the sunshine and get to points close by  via the Burke-Gilman trail. I walked to all the shops and restaurants of Ballard Ave or to a D bus stop to take me directly downtown. \\n\\nThe cottage is very well decorated and makes you feel very comfortable, as does Shawn. He was never bothersome, but always responded. \\n\\nAlso, the neighbors are really nice and invited me to their BBQ!\\n\\nStaying here played a big part in my having an incredible visit to Seattle and I would love to stay again some time. This was one of the first airbnb\\'s my fiance´ and I spent the night in.  And let me tell you, it was great.  There was plenty of room and the patio area in front of the home is prefect for relaxing and having a drink.  Shawn was very accommodating about the check in time, which was great for us as we showed up very late.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe on street parking that was reserved for us was perfect and right in front of the place.  The home comes with a little fire place, which is a really nice touch.  It\\'s set far enough away from the street that it\\'s very quiet at night, which is awesome for getting a good nights rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely stay here again given the chance, and would not hesitate to recommend Shawn and his home to anyone looking for an airbnb. Shawn\\'s place is a GREAT home base to explore Seattle.   The place is darling and perfect for two people although you could make it work for four people too.  It was well stocked and equipped with everything we needed and Shawn was super responsive and helpful.   The bikes were a super plus!  \\r\\nWe loved the Ballard neighborhood!  Great food, laid back and the locks are really cool.   It\\'s also adjacent to the happening neighborhood of Fremont.   It\\'s only about a 10 minute drive to downtown seattle too.  Again:  Awesome home base. \\r\\nWe would definitely stay at this sweet Ballard cottage again!   We loved the home from the moment we arrived! The location was amazing, and the size of this home was perfect. Shawn went above and beyond answering our questions about the surrounding area. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis home is located next to Ballard\\'s best breweries and walkable distance to the downtown area. We used the bus system and found it really easy to use.  The inside of the house was more spacious than the pictures make it out to be. It was very cozy and comfortable, great shower! The neighborhood was close to everything...only a 10min drive to just about everywhere in Seattle.   I had a great stay at Shawn\\'s cottage when I came to Seattle for a week for work.  Check-in was easy and convenient.  Everything was clean and charming, and the location (somewhere around the Ballard/Fremont line) was perfect for my needs.  I never had an issue finding on-street parking.  I especially loved that the kitchen was fully stocked, with one quibble--there was no microwave, which made reheating some leftovers a challenge.  So keep that mind if it\\'s an issue for you.  It\\'s not a dealbreaker for me, I would definitely stay again. Super cute and clean cottage. Great eclectic artwork everywhere. Well appointed. If you are brewery fan, there is one on every other block. Lots to explore with the bikes that come with the cottage. Shawn was really responsive when I needed him. Cooper the cat next door is an added plus - fat and lovable! Shawn\\'s Ballard cottage was exactly what we were looking for in our mid week visit to Seattle.  Working in the brewing industry, Ballard was the perfect location with something like 11 breweries all within a 5 mile radius.  Shawn answered any and all questions we had in a timely manor and helped us navigate public transportation to get to his home without breaking the bank and taking a cab.  I would 100% recommend his home to anyone looking to stay in a vibrant, positive and beer/food focussed neighborhood in Seattle.  Thanks Shawn! We really enjoyed our stay at Shawn\\'s cottage in Ballard!  It was the perfect size for my husband and I. It is in a great location. We were in walking distance to many restaurants and breweries. It was very easy for us to drive to downtown Seattle. We would definitely stay here again! Shawn gave us great recommendations on where to eat and visit during our stay, and provided maps and local info. Description of home was accurate and neighborhood was cute. Fabulous place! So close to everything we wanted! Shawn is a great host and very responsive to our requests or questions! Definitely a comeback to and stay kind of place.  Absolutely loved staying at Shawn\\'s cute house in Ballard! It was clean and well appointed. The bikes were an amazing amenity too. I will definitely recommend this place to friends and hope to be back next time we are in Seattle. This cottage provided a very nice base for our long  weekend in Seattle.   It was very clean and comfortable and the location was perfect. There is an awesome brewery just a few minutes walk away and other amenities are easily walkable. I have no hesitation recommending this spot to future guests.  Really nice place in a great location. Shawn responded to all inquiries and messages in a timely fashion. Definitely recommended.  shawn is a great host he would send us information on events that were happening in the area.    this house is located  right where you need to be.  we will probably be staying here again when we come back up in a year. over all a week well spent.\\r\\n\\r\\n  oh and watch out for cooper the cat. scared the hell out of me  when he jumped in my lap while i was reading a book.  Cute cottage, with artsy vibe. There are a bunch of taphouses in the neighborhood, so a taphouse crawl can be a lot of fun. Very comfortable, super clean and quiet, with plenty of room to relax.  My husband, daughter & I loved our stay at Shawn\\'s cottage. The pictures are accurate, the space is clean & uncluttered (but has personality), and Shawn was a friendly & responsive host. My daughter was comfortable on the pull-out sofa. We felt like we had plenty of space, especially with the deck, which is another room with lovely views in good weather. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s a nice playground & great coffee just a short walk away. We did end up driving a fair bit, when we needed to go to other parts of Seattle that weren\\'t downtown. Biking wasn\\'t an option with a 3-year-old, but I can imagine using bikes if I\\'d been alone or with a friend. Shawn\\'s Ballard home is such a great place to stay in Seattle. The location couldn\\'t be better, and the house is very cozy and well appointed. We were able to cook a fantastic dinner in the lovely kitchen, and made use of the grill on the deck. We will definitely rent this space again, as we have family living near by, and will recommend it to other visitors as well. Thank you, Shawn! Shawn\\'s place was an awesome way to experience Seattle for the first time. We enjoyed being a short walk from Ballard, with lots of bars, restaurants and other fun options. His cottage is also a super short walk from at least three micro-breweries and slate coffee bar. The cottage itself was clean, quiet and private. Awesome deck to enjoy your morning coffee. I would definitely stay again!  The house was beautiful and vey comfortable.  There was so much to do nearby and the neighborhood felt safe and convenient.  The record player was a nice touch!  The front deck was a nice hangout spot. Finding parking on the street was never an issue. I would definitely recommend this place to others and I would love to stay here again. Shawns home was wonderful. Centrally located near many amazing breweries, the neighborhood was peaceful and beautiful. His house is clean, inviting and has array of amenities that made us feel right at home. \\r\\nIf you get a chance, take a stroll down to Stoup, a local spot with an IPA that\\'ll please even the seasoned beer drinker. \\r\\nThank you Shawn for welcoming us into your home and providing such a cool place to relax after a day\\'s adventure.  Great city, great neighborhood, great cottage!  Plenty of room for my husband and I.  The cottage is clean but comfy.  Several breweries within walking distance.  I highly recommend taking the bikes that Shawn provides east on the Burke Gilman trail to Gas Works park.  He also provides a lock in case you want to stop somewhere for a bit.  7-11 and Fred Meyer nearby for beer/food.  Golden Gardens park is a quick drive or $10 Uber away - get there early for a fire pit on a nice day.  Downtown Ballard is within walking distance - plenty to do there.  La Carta De Oaxaca is great Mexican food with a salsa bar.  French press and nice outdoor space at the cottage were great bonuses (and Cooper, the super friendly cat next door).   Awesome spot! We loved staying here - the location, the decor, the space, all were great. Shawn is a great host, too - he provides yummy local coffee & cream and also gave us tips about events in the neighborhood that he heard about. Would definitely stay here again& highly recommend to others! Shawn\\'s house was absolutely incredible. From the fresh coffee to the organic shampoo and conditioner in the shower- he makes his house so welcoming to guests. The neighborhood was great and the ride via Uber into the city was simple.  Parking was a breeze on the street right in front of the house and there was even a friendly cat named Cooper (his neighbor\\'s) that was hanging out with us on the deck. Everything about our stay was great. My husband and I spent two nights at Shawn\\'s house to start our honeymoon trip and it couldn\\'t have been a better experience. We will definitely return to Shawn\\'s house when we return to Seattle. Thanks again, Shawn! We thoroughly enjoyed Shawn\\'s home. The bed and couch were comfy, the kitchen was stocked with staples and spices, as well as coffee and fresh cream. The bathroom towels were great. It\\'s a great neighborhood. We biked to the locks and Gas Works Park (we recommend both), as well as several of the breweries in the area. As hilly as Seattle is in general, Ballard is not so. It\\'s very conducive to biking.  Many excellent breweries and restaurants are within walking/biking distance. None of the places we ate or drank at was a disappointment.\\r\\n   We would surely stay at Shawn\\'s again if we make it back to Seattle. Shawn\\'s place was fantastic. We love to check out local breweries when we travel, and there were a handful within a few minutes\\' walk from the cottage -- including one that was only a half-block away. We also enjoyed being able to easily walk to Ballard and Fremont restaurants since we didn\\'t have a car. The place itself was also comfortable and clean, and the front deck was a huge plus! My husband and I had the nicest stay at Shawn\\'s lovely 1-BR home in Ballard. It was such a comfortable place to come back to after long days exploring Seattle and Ballard. Shawn was super nice and provided us with a free growler of beer, and coffee and organic half and half to start our mornings. The house is about a 15 minute walk from the restaurants in Ballard (less than 5 minute drive) and within STEPS of a few microbreweries in the area. We also used the two vintage bicycles Shawn offers as part of the airbnb and had a blast riding around Ballard and beyond (highly recommend the Burke-Gilman trail). HIGHLY recommend this listing! Fully equipped, cozy, and comfortable home away from home. Shawn\\'s place is close to Downtown Ballard and he is an absolute professional. Quick communication and great recommendations.   Shawn was a fantastic host and was extremely responsive throughout our stay. We had a wonderful stay in his beautifully appointed cottage. It\\'s easy to tell that he is artistic; his home is decorated by many thoughtful touches that made our stay a singular one. The Ballard neighborhood was quaint and friendly and was within a few miles of several small breweries. I can\\'t say enough about what a great experience it was.  We had a nice stay at Shawn\\'s. He provided helpful information about the area, which was centrally located to many bars and restaurants. A bit of a drive if you are looking to go downtown but we had a car rental so it was no problem. The place was exactly as pictured.  What a wonderful place to call home in Seattle! Shawn made sure this home has everything you need and was attentive, supportive, and welcoming. We enjoyed the spacious deck (along with the friendly neighbor cat, Cooper). For a 1 bed/1 bath, the space felt cozy and open, a rare combo. With impeccable attention to detail and plenty of personal charm, this home really felt like a home with enough space for us to really relax, unwind, and settle in. The little office desk looking out to the street on a gorgeous day is the perfect place to get some work done or write a sweet letter. Wish we could have taken the bikes out for a spin; gotta save something for next time! The location cannot be beat if you like friendly walkable neighborhoods within a stone\\'s throw of the big city. We didn\\'t want to leave when the time came but we are so grateful for this first AirBnb experience with Shawn and his charming Craftsman Cottage.  Such an awesome spot - not only is the place super welcoming, it has a great location & is one of the most eccletic AirBNB\\'s we\\'ve ever stayed in. My wife even said \"this is the coolest AirBNB ever!\" - and we\\'ve stayed at plenty AirBNB\\'s! Great vibe, decor & record collection to match - would absolutely stay here again, without hesitation! Shawn emailed instructions on where the key would be and \"checking in\" was seamless and simple. Shawn left a nice note and the house rules on the counter and the coffee and French presses were tantalizing obvious - no hunt to find them (or anything else). Fresh, organic cream for my coffee awaited me in the refrigerator.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe also left me to myself. I appreciated that very much. I called him once with a question, and he called me once. Perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love Ballard and Fremont. I lived in each and always consider them  cities in their own right, separate from Seattle (as they once were). Much has changed, but the funky eccentricities of Fremont remain, and it and Ballard are more vibrant and alive than ever. Shawn\\'s home is perfectly located, very near the \"border\" between the two. Shawn provides a great list of the eateries, and of other places of interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting to and from downtown is a snap (when you visit, be sure to cross the Fremont Bridge, my absolute favorite of the many bridges in Seattle - I used it everyday \"commuting\" from Shawn\\'s house. \\r\\n\\r\\nFremont and Ballard both are still \"working\" areas. That and the population density might cause some to expect it would be noisy and unpleasantly overcrowded. Neither is the case. Shawn\\'s home is a quiet, peaceful and serene retreat. An occasional boat horn or whistle was pretty much all the \"noise\" I heard - the Ship Canal is not that far away. The sounds were enjoyable. The home was a welcome refuge for me each evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nCooper finally came over. He is the friendliest cat I\\'ve ever met. After a few minutes of petting, he vaulted into my lap and started grooming my chin. Thus we sat, enjoying the quiet evening. He added to the serenity I felt at the little house.\\r\\n\\r\\nShawn\\'s home is much like Fremont and Ballard, I think. Art work that is a little edgy and a little eccentric -  among the elements I always liked about the area. Yet his reminders of his best friend showed me a different side of Shawn and they warmed my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would be happy to stay at Shawn\\'s home again. The outside stairs can be a little tough for those, who like me have some mobility issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nI loved the place this little house.\\r\\n\\r\\n Perfect spot in Ballard. Walking distance to great breweries and restaurants. The cottage was great. Shawn was a perfect host. Highly recommended if you are looking to check out a cool neighborhood.  Shawn was great, a really nice guy who made us feel very welcome. We loved the fresh flowers and friendly note when we arrived. The cottage is beautiful, we enjoyed relaxing on the deck and the bed is super comfy. The guitar was a great touch too! We had a lot of fun. We rode the bikes up the street to a great little espresso shop named Slate. The entire experience was perfect. This was a great house in a fun neighborhood. Stores and brewers within walking distance. Loved sitting on the deck and just relaxing.  Shawn left us coffee which was a nice touch. Highly recommend this house if you are in Seattle and don\\'t want the noise of downtown Shawn\\'s place was cozy and comfortable.  It had everything we needed for a great stay.  Shawn is a thoughtful and accommodating host.  I love petting Cooper the cat in the deck too!  Would definitely return! Shawn was extremely hospitable and responded to any queries we had in a very timely fashion.  A very cool house in a super fun area.  This cottage provides great access to the wonders of Seattle.  Highly recommend this spot! Thanks, Shawn, for the wonderful stay! Your cottage was the perfect place to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. It was exactly as described and we found a ton of great things to do within walking distance. The special delivery of local beer was really awesome. We\\'ll definitely be looking for your house the next time we plan a trip to Seattle!  Great little house in a fun part of town. Shawn\\'s got a very comfy and clean spot. I hope to go back when I have more time (and better weather) to hang out and enjoy a beer on the deck. Shawn\\'s a nice guy and super easy to deal with.  \\r\\nGreat apartment, plenty of room, and cozy. Plenty of cooking tools and basic supplies if you want to make use of the kitchen. Love the fireplace in the living room! Porch looked amazing to enjoy during warmer weather, but was a bit cold and grey this time of year.  Shawn\\'s place is great.  The cottage is lovely, I love the modern design  elements and all the space to spread out.  This was the perfect place for a stay in the Ballard area.  Parking was super easy in the neighborhood and the location is close to lots of restaurants and such.  I just wish I had more time to take advantage of the lovely kitchen and to hang out in the sunny living room there! Upon our arrival to Shawn\\'s cottage he made sure to be in close contact with all the appropriate info for our check in and stay. We checked in easily and loved the cozy vibes and stylish decor of the cottage. We immediately felt right at home and could not have asked for a better Airbnb experience! The cottage is also located close to great restaurants, shopping, and breweries. Will definitely stay here again when we head back to the PNW. Thanks Shawn :) Perfectly located, super clean, great aesthetics to the home. Really can\\'t say enough good stuff about our experience staying here. We walked around te neighborhood every day and Shawn\\'s house was the perfect jumping off point.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, big bonus having s great casual book selection on hand. The Washington Ski/Snowboard Backcountry guide definitely made me want to move to the PNW very soon. We had a wonderful stay with Irmgard and recommend her guest suite. Irmgard\\'s Guestsuite was the perfect place to stay in Ballard, and my boyfriend and I highly recommend it.  The home was spotless and extremely well-appointed..  Irmgard really thought of everything down to freshly-picked local strawberries and chocolates by the bedside.  Additionally, the location is a fantastic jumping-off point for all of (email hidden)ose to Gasworks Park, Green Lake, downtown Ballard, buses into Downtown.  Can\\'t wait to return, and I definitely hope to stay here again!  Thanks again! The B&B turned out to be nicely located in a beautiful Seattle neighborhood, which was convenient for our weekend stay in Ballard. Unfortunately, in the end, the experience fell short of what a comparatively priced hotel could offer. In fairness, Irmgard was quite friendly and was quick to respond to our emails and promised for future guests that she would address some of the negative experiences we had during our stay. If these changes were made, I could perhaps see the quality of stay reflect the price.   \\r\\n\\r\\nIssues we had included: 1.  A distinct mold/musky smell throughout the basement living area. 2. Bathroom mold smell with cramped, dirty shower. 3. Bed linens that appeared to be 10-15 years old. 4. Food items in fridge had expired.  5. Personal items like toothbrushes were handled and repositioned out of zip locks into a cup holder while we were away.    \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter our stay, Imgard was kind enough to mail a belt that was left behind. She offered to solve these issues that I posted here.  If so, this B&B might be a good choice for you Ballard stay.   We had a great stay at the Best Value Ballard Guestsuite. You can tell that Irmgard really enjoys hosting travelers from around the world, and she has high standards for the guestsuite, which is very professionally maintained (including chocolates by the pillow and a posted business license!).  Irmgard war eine sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin. Sie hatte sogar den Kuehlschrank fuer das erste Fruehstueck gefuellt! Es lagen viele Buecher und Karten bereit. Die Wohnung war sehr sauber und grosszuegig. Alles bestens! Irmgard proved to be a gracious host. Provided much appreciated extras including delicious chocolate candies, delightful home made slices of cake,and some everyday refrigerated items.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment or flat provided every convenience. Complete kitchen, spaciousl living room with an all channel TV,  immaculate bathroom and a large bed room with more then adequate clothes closet and drawer space.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location of the apartment makes all Seattle destinations and beyond readily accecsible.  We enjoyed our stay at the Ballard Guestsuite.  The location was perfect for us, and the apartment was clean and cozy.   Mrs. Castleberry is a thoughtful and attentive hostess.  Will definitely stay here again when we visit Ballard. Fantastic hostess, with all the amenities anyone could ask for!  The private entrance was a plus!!  Will definitely return! We had a wonderful time in Seattle. We were approx. 3 blocks from our kids place where we celebrated our granddaughter\\'s 1st birthday.  The suite is very homey and comfortable AND we slept better than we have in a very long time on the posturepedic bed! We cooked our own breakfast on Sat. and Irmgard had the dishes put away before we got back from the birthday party. The fresh flowers were such a nice touch. We are looking forward to our next stay during the Ballard Seafood Fest.\\r\\nVic & Deb Miller This was a delightful place to stay.  We spent two weeks here while we visited our new grandson and his parents.  We could not have asked for a better place to stay.  Many extras were provided for us.  We will return many times. Amazing experience. Very welcome and friendly environment with just the right mix of privacy and local assistance. Will not even consider any other hotel or B&B when visiting Seattle again.  This is a comfortable, peaceful place with luxury towels and linens, a comfy mattress, well-stocked kitchen, and an excellent location in the Ballard neighborhood. The hostess is welcoming and friendly and available to help or advise if desired. She does housekeeping in the unit daily, providing fresh towels, etc. and also provided fresh flowers during my stay. What a lovely touch! I had everything I needed and more. I definitely recommend Irmgard and her guestsuite, and I will stay here again. Many thanks!! I can\\'t say enough good things about my stay at the Ballard Guestsuite.  This is my first time visiting Seattle, and Irmgard made me feel welcome and supported.  She provided a map with directions to the local grocery store and helpful hints about parking in town.  I strongly recommend this place for solo travelers and those who appreciate privacy.  It was great to come \"home,\" relax, and be totally self-sufficient.  Thank you for everything, Irmgard and Ben!!     We felt right at home again. This was our 2nd time staying at Ballard Guestsuite. We would recommend anyone to stay there! A very comfortable, extremely well-appointed suite in a quiet residential neighborhood. Attention to detail in attending to guests\\' needs, including quality body care products, daily European chocolates, umbrellas for the not infrequent inclement Seattle weather, even a sewing kit (which we used) in a basket of things you never thought to bring on a trip, but just might need in a pinch. And Irmgard is the ultimate gracious hostess. A gem of a find and an excellent value. A beautiful and private offering by a most gracious host.  Look no further because the Ballard Guestsuite cannot be beat. - Lots of space and parking.\\r\\n- Nice kitchen, living room, bedroom and private bath.\\r\\n- Strict Hostess, always home, with lots of rules, felt like \\r\\n  we were walking on egg shells.\\r\\n- The space is private, but not sound proof. You have to be very quiet.\\r\\n- Came in to room every time we left to run errands to unplug     \\r\\n  kitchen appliances.\\r\\n- It was nice to get fresh towels.\\r\\n- Spotty wifi\\r\\n- It was fine, but next time I will book a hotel for $40 more. \\r\\n My parents had a wonderful peaceful stay. They loved the flowers. Irmgard is a wonderful host. I would and will recommend this site and Irmgards place to others. thank you! A lovely spot - quiet and peaceful. Irmgard was a thoughtful hostess - unobtrusive, but every need anticipated. I highly recommend this spacious, clean, charming apartment! What a great place in a great location! Irmgard was a very welcoming hostess with a lot of helpful suggestions for our move to Seattle. The place itself was clean and safe with all the amenities you could need. Thanks for the great stay! Very cute, cozy place to stay!  It reminded me of a well-furnished cabin because it was so cozy and made you feel at home - except this cabin is just minutes from downtown areas and has every amenity you would get in a hotel (coffee, cereal, soaps and shampoos - even chocolates by the bed!).  Irmgard was extremely thoughtful in every detail, and very helpful with explaining local buses and where to walk and providing maps, etc.  The bed is VERY VERY comfortable and there are lots of windows for fresh Seattle air.  You aren\\'t right in the hustle-bustle of things, but its not hard to get there when you want that.  Old Ballard was a walkable distance and everyone in Seattle suggested this as THE place to be. The Ballard guest suite and Irmgard\\'s warm hospitality were an important part of our wonderful Seattle vacation!  Just completed our second visit to Irmgard\\'s guestsuite.  Everything was perfect, including the most comfortable bed, along with night-time chocolates!  Convenient location, whether walking, driving, or riding the bus!  Thanks, again, Irmagrd! What a wonderful get away. The apt is so cozy and quiet. We had a chance  to go out and paint the town red, but opted to stay in and enjoy the cozyness of the apt ater a long. day. We highly recomend Imgards lovely apt. We will be back. Thanks agair Kay and Dan Loibl Fun stay. Irmgard goes out of her way to make it so. Quaint setting, clean, comfortable; good stock for breakfast in the fridge with some nice extras. Full kitchen, comfortable bedroom and mattress. North of Seattle, so a bit of a journey from the airport. If going downtown -DRIVE- you can park on the near north side in the city center parking center --- ten bucks for ten hours. It\\'s right at the space needle and the ducks (recommended). Skip the music museum; unless you\\'re Hendrix or Grunge fan, it has little to offer -- expensive too.  Also, from the center area you can take the monoraill downtown. Anyway, the B&B is a great value. Would stay there again! Irmgard\\'s Ballard Guestsuite is a cozy little home away from home and a great value.  The host\\'s description of the place is spot on, right down to the fresh flowers and chocolates.  The place has been well loved, but is very clean, full of character and the bed is super comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIrmgard was a gracious and accommodating host, especially considering our visit was very last minute.  She was quick to respond to our inquiries and made us feel quite welcome in addition to being a helpful source of information on the neighborhood and city.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would certainly be happy to stay at the Ballard Guestsuite again! We had a lovely stay at Irmgard\\'s and Ben\\'s Ballard Guestsuite.  The location was perfect for us and convenient to shopping, markets and sites.  The accommodations are a great value and were spotless, and the kitchen was fully equipped; I was even able to do some Xmas baking. Our hosts were gracious and accommodating.  We had everything we needed for a very pleasant stay.  We will definitely come back our next visit! \\r\\n\\r\\nHappy New Year to the Castleberrys,\\r\\n\\r\\nKarla and John Lenfesty We enjoyed our stay at the Ballard Guestsuite.  The Apt is clean, comfortable, cozy and warm.  We really appreciated the maid service!\\r\\nWe will stay here again if available. We had a comfortable and great stay at the Ballard Guesthouse. Irmgard is an excellent host - we had a late flight out and she was able to let us check out later. The space is super clean and quiet and is spacious. Our towels were changed daily, the bed was made daily and we even got chocolate by the bed every night. They have lots of Seattle travel guides available and I highly recommend the restaurant, Blue Glass, just a few blocks from the house.  Irmgard\\'s gues tsuite was wonderful! She paid much attention to detail. Everything was as expected plus a few pleasant surprises (flowers, chocolates..). It was a great AirBnB experience. I would definitely stay with her the next time I am in Seattle. Irmgard is a fantastic host. Her guest suite was very clean, cozy, and comfortable. There were clean towels provided every day and breakfast food and drink in the kitchen that you could help yourself to as well which was much appreciated on my part. Also, Irmgard herself is very nice and considerate - when she noticed I left something important after my stay she sent me an email telling me so and offered to mail it to me even though I had left. Overall I would definitely recommend staying at her guest suite and will do so myself when the need arises again. This was our first use of airbnb and we are sold! What a great way to travel. We were met at the car when we arrived, and it was late nearly midnight. There were a few goodies in the refrigerator to use for breakfast, coffee, tea even juice. Maps of the area brochures of things to see places to eat. The rooms were very clean nice comfortable bed  and a sweet each night on the pillow. Full kitchen a setting room with a nice flat screen TV.There was even a list of all of the channels  Next trip to Seattle this is where we will stay. We had a very pleasant stay at the Ballard Guest House.  It was like having our own apartment while we were there.  The accommodations were quite nice - very clean and well kept. Irmgard had a well stocked refrigerator so we did not have to go out for breakfast.  The fresh flowers and chocolates each night were a nice touch.  We will return. Irmgard\\'s place is very comfortable, clean, and has everything you need. She is very sweet and professional. The Ballard Market is also very good and very close. We loved our stay! this was our first time using Airbnb and could not have been more thrilled. We would love to stay here every time we get to come back to Seattle. The reservation was canceled 69 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Irmgard\\'s apartment is exceptional.  It is so spacious, excellent location.  Irmgard truly understands a traveler\\'s needs and anticipates everything.  Could not have asked for better accommodations.  Would recommend to anyone needing a place to stay in Ballard. Irmgard\\'s guest suite is the perfect blend of cozy and spacious. The location was perfect for exploring Ballard, the University District, Lower Queen Anne, and Capitol Hill. Irmgard\\'s hospitality was truly splendid - fresh flowers, chocolates on the bedside table, a hand annotated map, and a schedule for the Folklife music festival. A wonderful place and an even more wonderful hostess! We had a great time in Seattle, and this is a great place to stay!  It\\'s so nice having your own home to come to home to at the end of the day which is exactly how you feel.  We lived in Seattle for a number of years, but Irmgard provides an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the area is is quite gracious.  We will stay here again. Irmgard is an amazing host.  She provides an incredible level of service (she provided clean linens and made the bed everyday) while respecting your privacy.  She is also very nice and was flexible about our check in time when we asked to drop off our bags on the first day of our stay.  Irmgard\\'s apartment is also very convenient to several bus stops.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay here a lot and I would stay here again.  I will also recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. What a great experience! Irmgard is a wonderful hostess. Fresh flowers and berries from her garden were just a few of her personal touches.Great location, quiet neighborhood. I would love to stay here again. Irmgard had the unit ready for us upon arrival. She was very friendly and was able to provide good information about the ballard area. We loved the extra perks such as extra food in the fridge, fresh flowers, and chocolates by our pillows. The unit was also kept very clean. We\\'ve had two different groups of family stay here at different times over the years and its been a wonderful place to stay each time. Irmgard is a wonderful hostess. Beautiful house in a great part of town. She was very clean and provided us directions and travel information. If we come back for a visit, we will definitely stay here, highly recommended.  This was our first stay with AirBnB and we are very glad that we chose to stay at the Ballard Guestsuite. With over 30 years of experience, Irmgard clearly understands and offers what her guests want: service, privacy and European style hospitality! \\r\\n\\r\\nWe appreciated the level of attention and detail that she provided from our initial email communication to our warm welcome in person. Irmgard is a most gracious hostess who made sure that our stay with her was very enjoyable. It\\'s no surprise that she has many repeat visitors!\\r\\n\\r\\nTha Ballard Guestsuite is in a very convenient location in an historic neighborhood and made an excellent home base for our time visiting with friends. This is a cozy and comfortable apartment that we are hoping to return to next time for a much longer stay! Gracious Hostess 7 Roomy Apartment-\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guest suite is a bit old fashioned in terms of furnishings and decor but it is spacious, extremely well equipped and clean. Neighborhood is quiet and safe with parking right at your door. Mrs. Castleberry was the perfect hostess with answers to all of our questions about the neighborhood. Cosy place and very friendly hosts!  The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Very comfortable and convenient.  A great find.  I will return!   We highly recommend Irmgard\\'s Ballard Guestsuite.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe spacious suite included not just a bedroom, but also off-street parking, private entry, living area with TV and office section, well appointed kitchenette and private bath with clean, fluffy towels daily.  The queen bed was extremely comfortable with quality linens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe safe neighborhood location was convenient to shopping and restaurants, and more importantly, to our son and his family.  We appreciated thoughtful touches like the fresh flowers and chocolates.  We hope to return again, whenever we next visit Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSue & Floyd Another lovely stay at Irmgard and Ben\\'s Ballard Guestsuite.  You will not want for anything.  Great location, cozy, plenty of room, and attentive accessible hosts. I booked a two week stay for my parents who were in Seattle to help my brother and his wife with the new baby.  Irmgard\\'s place was close to them and the main shopping area in Ballard.  The place was great.  She made sure my parents were comfortable and had everything they needed. The suite was warm, had a stocked kitchen and spacious living room. My parents enjoyed their stay Our stay with Irmgard Castleberry was excellent and she is a very gracious host. The little extra things that she does really makes you feel welcome in her home. The house is very clean and private. Just want to say Thank You Irmgard and we will stay again. We very much enjoyed our stay at the Ballard Guestsuite.  Irmgard is a wonderful, considerate host, a true hospitality professional! The space is quiet, private and immaculately clean, easy walking distance to transit and the Ballard district. Off-street parking is a plus. Highly recommended! The reservation was canceled 87 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. My mom and my sister stayed at Irmgard\\'s place for one week. It was perfect- clean, a lot of space and Irmgard is a super friendly and helpful host. Thank you! This was our first airbnb rental.  Nice location, quiet, clean, and comfortable.  It is a basement unit with lower ceilings, but everything was very nice.  The bed was comfortable and we slept well.  Great neighborhood, Irmgard met us when we arrived and showed us the unit, and was available during our stay.  Overall a great experience. This was our first visit to Seattle and our first Airbnb experience. We were not disappointed! Irmgard is warm and accommodating, a wonderful host. The guest suite suited our needs perfectly, personal touches were noticed and appreciated and off street parking is a plus. We will definitely stay here when we return to Seattle.   This was our first Airbnb stay. Irmgard was a wonderful hostess. The basement apartment was very clean, with a new mattress in the bedroom, and nice fluffy towels in the bathroom. Irmgard left a map highlighting grocery stores and local places of interest within walking distance. \\n\\nWe loved the fresh flowers! The tasty local coffee in the cupboard was a nice touch! They did an excellent job paying attention to the little things, like leaving the light on and turning on the heat when we came in late one evening.\\n\\nThe neighbors across the street tend to park directly across from the driveway. We found it easiest to back in the driveway so we didn\\'t have to worry about accidentally hitting cars parked on the street. The location and neighborhood were fine.  We only stayed 2 evenings so we did not walk the area although we noticed many previous visitors had and found it charming.\\r\\nThe guest suite was in excellent condition.  It was extremely clean and had all the amenities you would need to be at home.  Irmgard even left a basket of toothpaste, toothbrushes, bandaids, sewing kit, etc for your convenience if you forgot something.\\r\\nShe had milk cream, yogurt, English Muffins, etc in the refrig. for our breakfast.  \\r\\nMy only concern was when she came to our suite in the evening to tell us to turn off the fan in the bathroom because she could hear it.  She was stern and interrupted our otherwise pleasant evening.  We then felt like she was listening to us.  She also comes in to clean everyday.  \\r\\nWe still would recommend her place. Irmgard was a wonderful host and very accommodating overall.  The Guest Suite was exactly what we expected - cute, clean, comfortable and spacious.  There were fresh flowers, some items in the pantry for us, and nice notes and information about the area. The location was excellent - close to many activities, restaurants, and bars.  I enjoyed my visit at Seattle-Ballard Guestsuite.  The basement apartment was very cozy.  Irmgard was very friendly and helpful--she was available to give directions and answer questions.  The neighborhood was nice and seemed family oriented.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was by myself, so I do not think my host knew when I was in their basement apartment, which has access to their living spaces without  going outside. I was studying during the day and out at night visiting with my son. The first night I was out with my son and missed the friendly \\'turn-down\\' of the bed!\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not have Verizon cell phone service while there.  The wifi service worked fine as did the cable service.\\r\\nThanks Mary\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for a  Host is a very lovely lady. Her hospitality is visible from the moment you step in the guest unit. Fresh flowers, nicely stocked pantry, tourist information- everything you need to make your stay really special.\\r\\nThe neighborhood is very nice. Public transportation to downtown is within a few easy to walk blocks. A few more walking blocks and you have some of the best restaurants in the city.\\r\\nWill be back! Wonderful place, like your favorite perfectly prepared with everything you\\'d need grandmothers basement. Irmgard is warm and and I was perfectly comfortable and made to feel welcome....would stay again in a heartbeat!!!! The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting. She made us feel welcomed and was friendly it is a well kept place nice and clean in an ok area Staying here was the first time in decades of travel that I truly felt I had my own home away from home. The suite was very well appointed so that we had all the little things missing from other places: lots of hangers and closet space, toiletries, full-size kitchen full of kitchen stuff, blankets, plentiful lighting, private parking, private entrance, great bed, etc. We used the bus stop across the street to easily go downtown, yet at the same time the nights were quiet for sleeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only negatives were no big deal for us: low ceilings and a weak wireless signal. We didn\\'t even notice the ceilings till my partner tried doing a reach-for-the-sky stretch, but someone over 6\\' would have to do some ducking between rooms. We just used 4G for internet, which worked great with both AT&T and Verizon. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn\\'t see too much of our hostess as we had a very active stay, but when we did she was very nice and helpful. Every day while we were out she came in to clean up, making the bed, and leaving fresh towels and chocolates. She accommodated my allergies very well, even washing our sheets in a special unscented, organic laundry detergent. We felt very well taken care of.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can whole-heartedly recommend Irmgard\\'s Ballard Guestsuite. We hope to return again someday. Irmgard was the best host we have ever had, and such a lovely woman. She was so helpful, right from the moment we knocked on the door to when we checked out. The guest suite is perfect, it has anything you will need whilst being on holidays. The extra little touches are so sweet, the chocolates by the bed, the vases of flowers on the tables, fresh towels daily. She was so helpful. The apartment is very comfortable, nice sheets on the bed and very comfy mattress. She helped us with which bus to catch and what time we needed in order to get to our train on time. She had a great knowledge of how to get around the area and nice places to visit. She is very hospitable and made us feel at home.\\r\\nBallard is a lovely area, the streets are beautiful to walk around, there are sweet shops to look in and a lovely farmers market on Sundays. \\r\\nThis is the most well set up airbnb place we have stayed at. She has literally thought of everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible. \\r\\nIf we ever return to Seattle we will definitely stay at Irmgard\\'s, and I highly recommend staying there to anyone else visiting the area. \\r\\nThank you Irmgard!!  Irmgard is a wonderful hostess.  Very warm and inviting.  The apartment is in the basement and looks just like the pictures--very cozy; you don\\'t feel like you\\'re in a basement.  Irmgard left the day\\'s newspaper and chocolates by the bed everyday besides making the bed and refreshing the towels.  Lots of great little touches (flowers) that makes it feel more like a home. Irmgard\\'s guestsuite is spacious and very well appointed.  Even the little things like paper towels and toilet paper are of the highest quality.  There is off-street parking.  I would stay there again and I highly recommend it to all travelers. Irmgard\\'s was a cozy basement unit. I appreciated the breakfast items stocked in the kitchen and small touches throughout the place. She was even nice enough to lend us an iron. As always, staying at Irmgard\\'s was the best.  Always very comfortable and roomy.  And Irmgard is a wonderful hostess. Irmgard is a lovely person and an exceptional host with many years of experience offering hospitality. The apartment is sweet, clean, quiet, and perfectly suited to our needs. We were warmly greeted even though traffic left us arriving late (10p). Fresh flowers, chocolate by the bedside, and \"emergency\" food in the cupboards and fridge--including gourmet coffee--made us feel both pampered and at home. The towels are plush and the bed is incredibly comfortable. This was our second visit to the guesthouse and we will be back. Thank you Irmgard! Irmgard was the perfect host! She was very accommodating and attentive. She left chocolates and pastries and great coffee. The guest suite was exactly as described and was perfect for my visit. It was in a perfect location too!  The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Irmgard was very welcoming on our arrival. The apartment  was cozy and clean and the towels and bed were WONDERFUL....We stayed a week and didn\\'t think we needed daily maid service but Irmgard insisted!!  Thank you for the daily chocolates....\\r\\nThe neighborhood is so quiet and lovely....no noise at night....amazing for (email hidden)is was a great deal. Our stay with Irmgard and her husband in the lower floor (basement) of their Ballard house couldn’t have been more comfortable. Irmgard was certainly proactive in contacting me via email and we arranged a suitable check-in time with her. When we did finally get to their home (easy to find) I was happy to find that they had off-street parking at the house. Irmgard showed us our accomodation and described everything we might need to know for our short layover. I don’t think she left any questions unanswered on our arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were impressed with the sheer attention to detail that was evident in this AirBnB, right down to providing fresh and sealed travelers toothbushes for those of us who might have arrived unprepared. The kitchen was also fully stocked and we availed ourselves of English muffins generously included by our host. The AirBnB itself is spacious and exactly as described (living room, bedroom and kitchen, all with very acceptable dimensions), although calling it a basement unit unfairly conjures up for me at least a typical underground living space. Evidently people in Seattle use this term a little differently and the area is airy and light (with only a short step down from the side door into a small foyer. My wife had been slightly worried about potential for mold in the bathroom, but the room was spotlessly clean and we had no concerns at all with the envionment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AirBnB is conveniently situated a block from a main bus line, and certainly within easy walking distance from some major Ballard grocery stores, etc. Highly recommended for any length of stay. Irma was a gracious hostess. She made us feel so welcome. There was  much attention to detail to make our stay extra enjoyable. Really a nice place with lots of amenities. A comfy bed and a designated place to park were great, too. My favorite feature was the touch to go on lamps! Great little hideaway Irmgard is a wonderful host. She gave us a very welcome stay and clear instructions as to where everything was in our place of stay.  She was also not intrusive at all during our stay.  My parents stayed for a week. All the comforts of home. Fresh towels daily and well maintained kitchen. Very comfortable bed. New flat screen TvV (not shown in pics). Located on a quiet street with off street parking and convenient to supermarkets and city attractions. Daily maid service was a nice touch. Owner was so nice and helpful. She even stocked the pantry with some breakfast item. They plan on staying again. This is a lovely, clean, quiet basement suite, well appointed with kitchen ware, coffee/tea/etc, nice towels and linens and Seattle tourist info. We enjoyed our stay and would book again if we have the opportunity.\\r\\nMicki Irmgard was an amazing hostess. Our flight got in pretty late, but she stayed up and made us feel very welcome upon arrival. She showed us everything in the place, light switches, the restroom, etc. and even had good night chocolates for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place itself is great as well. Lots of space for the two of us, and also included a parking space for our car rental. It\\'s in a great location, providing easy access to Ballard and adjacent neighborhoods. It\\'s also just a short drive into downtown.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would definitely stay here again. Great place for a great value! Irmgard was a wonderful hostess who made us feel very welcome and at home.  She thought of every detail, including bedtime chocolates, fresh flowers and basic food items.  Her home was located in a convenient location.  We would definitely visit again. We appreciated Irmgard and her hospitality.  The guest suite was cozy and quiet.  We will be back. The hostess greeted us and took great care to make us feel comfortable throughout our stay. The first suite is close to a lot of nice restaurants, bars, shopping.and the water at golden gardens. Irmgard was an all around wonderful host! The guest suit felt private yet welcoming, we will absolutely be staying here again. Irmgard is a meticulous, thoughtful, helpful host. Her place is immaculate, and convenient to bus lines, Ballard and Phinney Ridge and other parts of close-in NW Seattle. This was our second stay here, and we wholeheartedly recommend this place. Irmgard\\'s guest house was comfortable and the kitchen had several food items available to use. She had wonderful information detailing what to see and how to get around the Ballard area. She was helpful and friendly.  My fiancée had a very comfortable stay. The breakfast foods were her favorite! Irmgard was the best host one can ask for. Beautiful home in beautiful Ballard. She hosted my mother on her visit to Seattle and gave her all the comforts of home - thick towels, fresh flowers, clean house. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe unit has an ample kitchen, stocked with all cooking and dining needs. You can\\'t beat the location. Walking distance to downtown Ballard - farmers market, local restaurants, bus lines, you name it. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will most definitely stay here in the future! Irmgard is a wonderful host.  Our stay was very nice. Gerd\\r\\n Irmgard was very accommodating in letting us pick up our key a little early. The Guestsuite is in a handy, centralized area of Ballard-easy walking to the downtown area. The neighborhood is quiet and the off street parking is very convenient. Several unexpected touches- staples in the fridge and most important - good coffee with a coffee maker. Overall thumbs up! Irmgard was a lovely hostess.  She clearly takes a lot of pride in providing a cozy and welcoming environment.  The location in Ballard was a great little headquarters for us to explore Seattle, which we were able to do through public transportation alone.  Plus, Ballard was an awesome neighborhood to stay in, tons of great food!  Check out The Fat Hen for an amazing breakfast just a walk away. Thank you Irmgard for sharing your beautiful rose garden.  We enjoyed our stay again.  It was peaceful place to be after our busy days in the city. Irmgard was a very welcoming and thoughtful host.  She greeted us upon arrival and showed us around the apartment.  The apartment was very roomy, very clean and quiet.  The off street parking is a big plus, especially in Ballard where parking spaces are at a premium.  Irmgard has a lot of useful information in the apartment to assist in sightseeing.  Lots of good books to read, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly recommend Irmgard\\'s apartment and plan to stay there again. Irmgard is a great host. Thank you so much Irmgard\\'s hospitality is superb!  Her Ballard guestsuite has everything a person needs, is extremely cozy, and convenient to Ballard shopping and restaurants. Irmgard is delightfully sweet and welcoming. She made me feel very much at home in her spacious apartment. The kitchen was well equipped. The bed was very comfortable. Especially comfortable was the retro Lazy-Boy-type recliner in front of the TV! It is located in a quiet residential neighborhood within easy walking distance of restaurants and grocery stores. I took long walks in the morning and this would also be a good place for runners to stay.  The guest suite was great. This was our first AirBnb experience and Irmgard set the bar high. We enjoyed the fresh daily towels and chocolates. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location was great. There was a bus to the Space Needle across the street and it was just a short drive if we wanted to take the car to downtown.  Irmgard was welcoming and thoughtful. She greeted us upon arrival and showed us around the place. The Guest suite was roomy and quiet.  Being able to park in her drive-way was a big plus as parking is tough to come by in Seattle.  Irmgard provided useful information about sightseeing and how to get around, also nice candies to eat every day.  The location was ideal as it’s in a quiet neighborhood but only a 15 minute drive to downtown Seattle.  Many highly rated restaurants were also with-in 10 minute drive from her place.  My wife & I enjoyed our stay and appreciate the hospitality & value Irmgard’s place offers. This place was I\\'m a great location. Irmgard was very welcoming and ensured we had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and the additional breakfast food was great.  Thank you for allowing us to stay here. A great experience! Irmgard was so warm and attentive. The home was lovely, almost spotless. The neighborhood is terrific, pretty quiet and well-kept. Plenty of parking. I love Ballard! The Internet access was a little weak. But otherwise, I could not have been happier. We had a wonderful stay in Seattle thanks to our lovely guest suite.  Our host Irmgard was very flexible as to our check-in time gave us a great overview.  We also had many breakfast options to fill up on before our sightseeing.  Very close to public transportation that arrived frequently.  We highly recommend staying here for any trip to Seattle! Irmgard is an attentive hostess, and does her best to make sure you\\'re comfortable. As others have mentioned, chocolates await you in the evening, we had fresh flowers in and around our place, and a bit of food stocked in the fridge. Irmgard can help you get around with bus advice, and information about the sights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guestsuite is walking distance from the zoo, and from a retro game shop, as well as a few nice bars, such as the tin hat. In all, we had a nice brief stay - I particularly liked the assortment of weird mugs (including one with a viking ship that said \"Grandpa\" that I wanted to take home with me (I didn\\'t of course)), curious knit throws, and watercolor paintings. It was like being at grandma\\'s house, but you were left to your own devices. Recommended! Irmgard is a great host.  Clean towels, great bed and quiet. She welcomed us with a smile.\\r\\n The apartment is fantastic: large and fully equipped with lots of details which made us feel like home. We also liked the quiet neighbourhood and found it easy to get into the city centre by bus. Irmgard was a wonderful host and took great care of us. We arrived a tad earlier than expected and Irmgard was happy to welcome us into the suite before lunch. The apartment is a perfect \\'piece of home,\\' much needed after a few weeks of road tripping, and the neighborhood is excellent for it\\'s proximity to downtown and Fremont. However, driving to areas such as Kirkland or Bellevue was (unsurprisingly) a ways off, so be aware that you may have a fair trek to those areas unless you take toll bridges more directly! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was incredibly welcome, and the small touches of hominess like chocolate each night and fresh flowers made it feel as if we were staying with family. Irmgard and Ben were also super quiet upstairs, and we tried our best to return the favor! My boyfriend is 6\\'5\" and Irmgard mentioned this as a good thing to note for future guests - he hit his head on a doorway once as they are a bit low but if you\\'re his height you\\'re likely used to such troubles ;) He had no problems with it, but some folks may want to take that into account.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe complimentary Seattle coffee in the cabinet was also delicious in the mornings and much appreciated, but be aware that the hosts do come in for \\'maid service\\' to straighten up the towels and such - we felt bad for leaving a dirty coffee pot and cups in the sink as someone washed it for us while we were out! Thank you for that. Hopefully our second morning made up for the first!\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, thank you so much for hosting us in Seattle! We hope to recommend this place to friends and return ourselves eventually. Irmgard was a lovely host. I loved her European style of B&B. She made us feel very comfortable and at home. The basement suite was very clean, comfortable and well organized. She waits up for all her guests to arrive (we arrived at 11pm) and gives everyone a tour of her place. She even showed us how to operate the lamps/TV. How many times have you visited a hotel and spent 15 minutes trying to turn on a lamp? Irmgard made sure all our bases were covered; an excellent hostess. Chocolates in the bedroom and fresh flowers from her garden were a great touch. I also loved the teddy bear collection that greeted us at the front door. \\r\\n\\r\\nEven though it says that breakfast is not included, Irmgard had a variety of cereals, jams and frozen waffles for us to eat. She even provided coffee, tea, and milk as well. There was even real maple syrup for the waffles (a delicious treat).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighbourhood is very lovely and the #28 bus takes you directly downtown. Ballard is a great place to stay: lots of lovely shops, breweries, cafes and restaurants. I would argue that we had a better experience touring Ballard than downtown Seattle. Further, Irmgard\\'s neighbourhood is quiet, with no loud noises at 2am that you often get when staying downtown. Definitely a great place to visit for a relaxing weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe wish we could have stayed longer and had more time to chat with Irmgard, so we hope to return in the near future. I would say that this is a gem of a B&B, for an extremely great value!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Irmgard greeted us with a smile. Her organic plums from her tree were delicious  The apartment was clean and cozy. The bed was very comfortable.  We\\'ll be back! We had a great stay. Perfect location, close to the highway and a bus ride to the city. The accemodation is spaceious and everything you need is there. Irmgard was very friendly and helpfull. We recommend this place to everyone. We had a great stay at Irmgard\\'s! The location was great and she was very helpful with any questions. To get to the heart of Ballard was just a good walk, or a $5 uber ride. We would definitely stay here again! Staying here was a great experience!  Irmgard is such a warm and friendly host.  She really cares, and it shows from the moment you arrive. There was homemade cake and plums picked from her garden waiting for us. The house is in one of the best parts of Seattle in terms of things to do (nearby shops, bars, scenery) and proximity to essentials (groceries, gas, etc.).  It\\'s also located right off a major road that has easy access into downtown Seattle.  Very convenient. The room is spacious and has a real nostalgic feel to it.  My wife and I felt like we were at home.  The fact that Irmgard has off-street parking available was fantastic, too.  Overall, a great place to stay, and Irmgard is one of those sweet souls that you don\\'t meet very often and never forget. I highly recommend this location.  Irmgard and her husband Ben were friendly, attentive and helpful in every regard. The apartment is supplied with lots of goodies. It is spacious and very relaxing as is the neighborhood.  Irmgard is a very welcoming host.  Greeted us when we arrived.  The guest suite is cozy, quiet and clean.  The bed is the best.  Slept so well.\\r\\nThanks again, Gerd Irmgard is a great host.  Our stay was very cozy and quiet.  The bed was very comfortable & the towels great.   We had a lovely time at Irmgard\\'s in Ballard, Seattle.  Very central location, she gave us great info for the area.  The apt was clean,great bed and walking the area felt safe with families and people walking dogs. Would love to go back and stay again\\n A lovely, comfortable place in a quiet neighborhood.  Good wifi, well-stocked kitchen, comfortable bed.  Everything I needed for the weekend.  Irmgard is a wonderful, helpful host who tries her best to make her guests comfortable. I had a wonderful experience here! Irmgard was so welcoming and thoughtful. This is truly an amazing place.  Irmgard was a delightful host.  The location was safe and very comfortable.  We enjoyed our visit to Seattle and loved coming home to a warm and quiet place to rest after a full day of seeing the sights. My husband and I came here to spend Thanksgiving with our daughter, who recently moved here to Seattle for a job. She is living in Ballard area. The place is huge and we wish we had more time to spend in this nicely home but we left in the morning and came back around 10 at night everyday. Every night we came back, the suite, the towels, the bed sheets are all clean. Very comfortable bed, pillows and comforter. Very warm place. No need to worry about getting a cold. Lastly, we will definitely come back and stay here at Irmgard\\'s guestsuite again. ~Joanna Our arrival went very smoothly. Irmgard was there to greet us and show us around.  She was very welcoming.  This is the second time that we stayed with Irmgard.  Her place is very comfortable.  It is quite spacious.  The bed also is quite comfortable.  Another nice touch that my husband liked was the nightly chocolates by the bed.\\r\\nIf we can get in, we will be back the next time we come to Seattle. Irmgard is a great host.  Cozy place to stay.  Always fresh towels and sheets ... very comfortable bed. Gerd\\r\\n We appreciated Irmgard\\'s cozy and quiet guest suite.  Good bed and clean towels everyday are wonderful. Irmgard was a wonderful host. The apartment is cozy and comfortable, the bed especially so with its new mattress. It is also exceedingly well equipped with any reasonable staple one could want and some of Seattle\\'s best coffee. Downtown is no more than a 15 minute drive and the University district even less. We couldn\\'t ask for more. Irmgard is a very gracious and welcoming host.  Cozy, quiet, great bed and wonderful fresh towels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n We a great stay at Blair\\'s place in Ballard.  The place was super clean and cozy.  Great decor and atmosphere.  And Blair was a great host...very friendly and easy to communicate with.\\r\\nHighly Recommend this place! Blair\\'s House is a fantastic location for exploring Ballard and Fremont areas. Our group had a great time and found the place to be very accommodating and comfortable. Check in/out was painless and Blair was easy to communicate with. I would definitely recommend a stay here to friends. What a fantastic house! Clean, new everything, easy to use electronics, fully equipped kitchen, superior bedding, fluffy towels (and lots of them). Entry access was easy. Never net Blair, but he was easy to communicate with and happy to accommodate my same day reservation with zero issues. Thank you Blair!  Great place in a great location.  Everything was ultra clean and well maintained.  Blair was responsive and took very good care of us.  Would definitely stay here again. We had a great time at this lovely, spacious home! Perfect for kids and great location. Extremely comfortable beds. Thanks for a great time! Loved the house. It\\'s just as described. It was quiet and comfortable. The kitchen was great. The owner was very responsive.  This is my first time to rent a house on Airbnb and it\\'s really a great experience to stay in Blair\\'s house. The house is very comfortable and get everything we need. It\\'s not far from Seattle Downtown and it takes only like 20 mins to space needle and pike market. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. Thanks Blair for the arrangement. My friends and I stayed here for 4 nights and had a fantastic time. The house is comfortable, clean, and spacious. It\\'s located in a super cute neighborhood and is just a short ride from downtown (where I needed to be for a work meeting). Blair was very accommodating about our request to check in early and check out late. Highly recommended!   It is a beautiful house! We have 7 people and everybody enjoyed the place! Blair is very friendly and he answered every questions that we have. The house has everything that we need. It is very easy and safe to park our car on the street outside the house. We have a wonderful trip in Seattle! Thank you very much Blair! Our company frequently hosts out of town employees for summits and conferences, so we needed a home with multiple bedrooms that would be comfortable for a weeks\\' stay. Blair was an excellent host, very communicative and the home received rave reviews from our team. We will definitely go to Blair first the next time we have out of town guests! Thanks so much! Great location and the beds are heavenly! Blair was a wonderful host! Thank you! Excellent location and house. House is clean.  Blair was very responsive.   Will definitely stay here again. Our host was helpful and informative. The neighborhood is very nice and the house was great. I recommend staying here. Great location, and a nicely appointed home base for our weekend in Seattle. Blair was great to deal with, responded to all inquiries promptly, and accommodated all of our needs.   We booked Blair\\'s Ballard home for my family\\'s trip to Seattle for our wedding. Booking was easy and Blair was always responsive to our questions. The family didn\\'t needed anything during our stay, but it was great knowing our host was easily accessible. This house very comfortably fit seven guests and has great common area space. The patio got a lot of use! This house is a quick walk to many restaurants and coffee shops and an easy drive to the city\\'s major attractions. Thanks so much for your hospitality! We would highly recommend Blair\\'s home for your trip.  Great house in a nice, quiet neighborhood with easy access to Ballard and Fremont. The house was clean, comfortable and all-around \"homey\"! Definitely recommended for those who would like to explore Seattle\\'s outer neighborhoods.  Blair was an awesome host. He provided us with all pertinent information about the listing and everything we needed to know about check-in/check-out. The home was very nice, equipped and furnished just like the description said. I would highly recommend to anyone who is staying in the seattle area and is looking for a spacious home in a quiet location within public transportation range of downtown seattle. I booked this home for family to stay at while visiting me in Seattle. It was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and close to many amenities, including grocery stores, restaurants, shops and the freeways. Plenty of street parking available.  We had such a great a experience staying in this house. A group of ten of us stayed here to celebrate a friend\\'s upcoming wedding and we couldn\\'t have had a better time! We especially loved the little back patio with lights strung overhead...perfect for a summer dinner party. Blair was an excellent host, very accommodating and responsive to my questions about the house before our stay.Though we never actually met, he was a pleasure to work with and I would definitely consider staying here again!   Blair responded quickly to my messages and was easy to communicate with. The house was pretty warm during the day because we happen to be there when it was quite hot in Seattle but we were out most of the time anyway so it wasn\\'t too bad. It was cool at night so we opened the windows and there were several fans around which helped a lot. Other than that, the house was comfortable and clean.  Nice comfortable home w good instructions \\nalthough I am a dunce w Netflix. No screens and\\nNo AC which I found out was norm in Seattle so\\nWatch for heat waves when you visit. Roomy\\nPlace w great kitchen so you can really cook! \\nClean and nice beds too!  The host was great and everything was set up for us when we got to the property. The beds were incredibly comfortable and everything was wonderful. We had a great experience at this house! We stayed for one night for a bachelorette party, and the house was a great size for the 8 of us that stayed overnight. We enjoyed sitting out on the patio during the day as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody looking to stay in the Ballard area! Great place! Very comfortable, nice soft sheets, clean and more than enough room for our six-person family. The kids loved the little basement area. Ballard has become a really lovely neighborhood, too. Overall we were very pleased with the house - it was clean and nicely appointed. Blair was very easy to communicate with.  Street parking was easy and it was located in a quiet neighborhood close to a grocery store and park.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only downside was that it was pretty hot during our stay so we had to open windows and as previous reviewers noted there weren\\'t any screens. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would strongly recommend this place to stay when visiting Seattle. Blair was great! His directions and notes were perfect and the house was as described.\\r\\nThe neighbourhood was quiet and the backyard was a great place to sit and chat. The host was very helpful and provided timely replies. The listing was pretty accurate. The neighborhood is in a nice area and a 20 minute car ride without traffic. Would recommend this to others.  The house is very nice, clean and cozy. It has everything we need. The area is nice and quiet. We had a great time there. Blair is easy to work with and very quick in replying all emails. I would definitely recommend Blair\\'s house to all my friends if they come to Seattle. The house was perfect! Especially if you love vintage charm. (Which I do).  There were 6 of us, so this place really had an unbeatable price when you consider what enough rooms at a hotel would have cost us. I highly recommend it. Also, prior to arriving, Blair graciously answered several questions on Seattle recommendations and we really appreciated that.  Perfect house for a group of 7 adults. Great location, great beds and good facilities in the house. When we arrived the house was not clean though (apparently a mistake was made in the cleaning schedule), but we were able to arrange everything with Blair, so it worked out fine.  The house was very clean and all set up for our arrival.  The kitchen was especially nice and a great place for us to cook up some breakfast.  Blair was also very accommodating of our relatively late changes in group size and responded quickly to our emails.  Overall, a great place to stay and a great host! I did not actually stay in this home; I rented it for my parents.  The home was lovely, although poorly cleaned upon arrival.  Guests arrived late that evening, well after check in, and the unit smelled overwhelmingly of smoke and had visible lingering smoke in the air.  The host apologized and did his best to accommodate the asthma sufferer by offering to allow her to stay in the neighboring duplex.  The host responded promptly to various requests made by the tenants during their month-long stay.   Blair\\'s home is located in a quite neighborhood near University of Washington. Communication with Blair was fairly easy; home manual is detailed and easy to follow. However, we were disappointed to find the floor was not vacuumed and there were hairs found on the bedding so we were not sure if the house was cleaned fully before we arrived. There were also stains on the carpet down to the basement. We were surprised to find this top rated vacation home is not very well maintained on the day of our arrival. Overall, it was not a pleasant experience and we won\\'t be coming back again.  Thank you Blair for providing a beautiful home for us to use while we were on holidays in Seattle.  Close to everything, very clean well kept home and you were very accommodating.  We\\'d stay at your home again anytime as it had everything we needed... al The home was as described and we had a good experience. The neighborhood was quiet. The location was excellent and located close to all of our functions. We would rent again if staying in the area. Blair was easy to get in touch with. House was roomy and fit 7 people easily, neighbourhood is quiet and safe, ~15 min drive to downtown Seattle.  There is a fantastic pizza joint is just down the block.   We loved our stay in Seattle. Blair was a great host, and was very easy to communicate with. We were able to check in late, which worked out perfectly for our group. The house was very spacious and the beds were comfortable. We really enjoyed Slate coffee which was only two blocks away. I would highly recommend staying at Blair\\'s house! Our daughter was getting married in Seattle and our family flew in from around the country and shared this great house. There was plenty of space for us, and we had so much fun just hanging out in the living room, playing games and laughing. The location was perfect, actually just a few blocks from our daughter\\'s home, and close to restaurants and shops. We would definitely rent this again. We were in Seattle for a week to celebrate our daughter\\'s wedding.  Seven of us stayed comfortably in the home , six in comfy beds and one comfortably on the sofa due to an airbed issue.  The neighborhood is quiet yet only 2 blocks from a main bus line into downtown.  Blair supplied us with the things we needed in a quick & friendly fashion.  Free laundry was a bonus !  Very nice duplex home stay !   The house is great and so is Blair.  There is safe parking on the street in a nice neighborhood.  The kitchen is well equipped and stocked.  Had everything we needed for our stay.  Would stay again in Blair\\'s place. The house is well appointed with nice modern finishes and plenty of space.  We had 5 adults and we had more than enough room.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a car so the location was just fine.  I wouldn\\'t recommend it if you are hoping to walk everywhere (especially in the winter). There are a few walkable places but Ubering to Fremont/Ballard only cost about $10, so its a pretty central location.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would stay here again if we needed another rental. Everything was as presented… house worked out great for us.  Location was close to family in Wallingford neighborhood, easy to find and lots of shops and nice neighborhood in growing Ballard community.  House was clean and everything worked out great.  Thanks Blair =) This a very beautiful house. Everything we needed was provided by the host. It was a reasonable price split among the 8 of us. I rented this house for my family during our wedding weekend.  The house comfortably fit 7 adults.  The house is exactly as described and photographed.  Communication with Blair leading up to the stay was great.  If we ever need another rental in Ballard for a group, this will be our first choice! Everything was as represented. It\\'s a comfortable house in a good location. The house was clean and well-maintained. Up-to-date washer and dryer were appreciated. Parking was easy. The pizzeria at the top of the street is worth a visit, and the large pile of DVDs Blair provided had selections appropriate for everyone.  Blair was efficient, prompt and helpful. The house was great - nice linen and towels and matched the write up. It was nice and warm. The Xmas lights on all the neighbouring houses added to the feel. A girlfriend weekend in Seattle for the theatre.  It was a perfect place and we got to explore Ballard and all the cute shops.  The house fit our needs perfectly and it was so nice and roomy.  It was welcoming and charming.  All of us loved it.  We had 8 in our group! The home was very accurately described, and Blair has an excellent set of instructions to orient his guests.  Quiet, safe neighborhood.  Our host made us feel welcome by confirming our arrival time.  The house was located conveniently for our trip for our son\\'s wedding.  The neighborhood was nice and the house was exactly as described on airbnb! This is a very nice 3BR home in a quiet & pretty neighborhood that is conveniently located.  The home was exactly as pictured. Everything was clean & ready for our arrival. Our stay went smoothly & I would recommend this listing to future travelers. Great home , exactly as described, clean, safe and comfortable. The basement area is pretty much a house by itself.  Everything was just as described. The place was clean and comfortable. It was a very convenient location for us near some local restaurants and coffee bars. It was great that our group could stay together in one house.  Everything was how it was described on the listing, and pictures were spot on. The place was clean and comfortable, and was the perfect spot to stay for a large family. The neighborhood was quiet and a close distance to coffee shops, grocery stores, bars and restaurants. It was also a short distance to major attractions within Seattle. The house was great.  Two good bedrooms upstairs, along with a living room and kitchen.  Downstairs was another bedroom with bunk beds (worked well for my kids) along with another living/siting area.  Fun neighborhood (we had good weather and walked to the zoo, which is about 0.5 miles away, up a bit of a hill). We really enjoy the stay in Blair\\'s house, well equipped and modern style. Located in a quite community but still convinient to stores, supermarket by car. Definitely will choose here again next time. The house was exactly as described. Very spacious with a lower level additional bathroom, living room and bedroom with bunk beds. The neighborhood was super quiet and off street parking was easy. The outdoor space was a very nice feature and the location was perfect. We walked everywhere we went and Blair was nice enough to recommend a few breweries before our visit. I would stay here again.  Blair was such a great host,super easy to deal with.The house got everything I need and the location is good too.When I checked out,I forgot my laptop in the house,Blair was so patient to help me find it,I really appreciated that.One last thing,even with all the stuff done,I have not met Blair,so if you want privacy,this is the place to go. We had an excellent stay in this beautiful, roomy 3-bedroom house. The photos in the listing were spot on, but we were still pleasantly surprised by this charming space. It\\'s located in a quiet, yet very accessible neighborhood. We would definitely recommend it for your next stay in Seattle. The house was perfect. Plenty of space for the seven of us. The back patio was a nice touch after dark. I would definitely stay here again.  Place was great. Exactly as described, convenient and easy to get in and out of town. Plenty of parking right at the house. Kitchen is great as well. House was very clean and the beds were comfortable. We enjoyed our stay in this cozy home and neighborhood. Since we had a large group and were planning for meals/sleeping arrangements, I asked Blair quite a few questions leading up to our stay. He was always very responsive and helpful. The house was clean and rooms were comfortable. Blair even made a special trip to the house to bring us a blender that was supposed to be there but wasn\\'t. He worked hard to make things right and I would definitely recommend the house to any larger groups looking for a homey environment.  Hi Blair. Had a great experience with the house and so handy to get to the zoo and grocery shopping. Nice quiet neighbourhood. Couple of things I\\'d like to mention though. As discussed on the phone the blow up mattress had not been left at the house however; we made do. One thing that did frustrate us was the dishwasher was full of dishes and it had apparently been turned on but it was so jammed full that the majority of the dishes had hardened crusted food on them which required washing them in the sink before we could use them. Wherein laid another problem that there was not enough dish soap to properly clean the dishes. I would have thought that the cleaning fees we paid would have included emptying the dishwasher for the incoming guests as well as ensuring there was adequate supplies (dish soap). We noticed there was no bath/shower soap or shampoo that we usually experience when we do the home rentals. All in all though the he did meet our needs. Regards. - Phil.  The house was beautiful and the space was even bigger than the photos made it look. Blair had a sheet of paper with the house rules clearly written on it, along with WiFi password and location of other amenities. Very comfortable seating and bedding as well. Worth every penny! We enjoyed our stay at Blair\\'s home in Seattle. The house was clean and as described. It was in a great location to explore Seattle! Beautiful house in a very friendly neighborhood! Bus routes and other convenience stores were very accessible. Comfortably fits a group of ten. Everything was clean and the advertising pictures were accurate. The house was great!  Everything was just as described.  Quiet neighborhood, close to downtown.   Lots of room, and extra bedding.  Easy parking in front of the house. Kitchen was well equipped. House was very clean and the beds were comfortable.  Thanks for such a pleasant experience! My family and I rented Blair\\'s place in March for 3 nights. We all found his place neat, with ample space (there were 6 adults and 1 child during our stay and we all comfortably fit) and in a quiet, convenient location. Blair was very responsive. This is my second time to rent from him and it\\'s always been a pleasure to do business with him.  This house is BEAUTIFUL. It was within walking distance to the store (Trader Joe\\'s) which was very helpful. The kitchen had all of the necessities (blender, toaster, etc) and the couch in the living room was so comfortable. Blair was extremely prompt and helpful. Would stay here again if we ever find ourselves in Ballard! A very nice house in a great location. I have spent a good amount of time thinking about this before I felt that I could make a fair honest review. Let me start by saying the overall experience was very good, however there are a few things about the property that I feel need to be mentioned just to make the description of the property a bit more accurate. Let me state again that I\\'m not trying to sway anyone away from this home, it was very nice, huge, and quite clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst and most important to me the walkability: yes it is absolutely walkable, however with the exception of a few close restaurants, most everything is at min a 20 min walk, including the closest grocery store. (Which on a side note ballard town and country market is a great store) This situation is easily resolved with a service like uber that is readily available in seattle, but I guess my point is that when walkable is in the title, I would expect to be a bit closer to the action. (In my opinion at least)\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond the amenities: now this was not really a big deal, and in fact  i\\'m not even sure how much the amenities were really touted on this homes description, but nonetheless I feel they deserve mentioning. our situation was admittedly a bit out of the ordinary. (one member of our group caught a cold en route.) As a result she was forced to stay inside for a couple of days and us with her for the majority of the time. We found that the main tv was a bit too old to plug in a chromecast to stream content, and the wifi was too weak downstairs to use the slightly newer tv. Once again not a big deal, but a minor annoyance for a semi/premium priced home.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso along the same lines, in most of the airbnb homes that I have stayed, the hosts usually stock the pantry with a few basic items, tea, maybe some chips, condiments, sometimes even a beer or two. that is not the case here so if you will be staying for a while you will need to purchase everything you need. Again its not much of a problem, but it would have been nice to have some tea around for our sick friend while I went to the store to get her some meds.\\r\\n\\r\\nlastly if you didn\\'t notice it in the pictures, this home shares a common wall with another home. Im not sure if its a rental as well or not, but it made me very conscious of every sound we made, especially later at night. I for one hate the idea that I might be disturbing another tenant, as I usually like to stay up quite late.\\r\\n\\r\\nI just want to close by saying that it should show you something that I have to pick the place apart just to find flaws, overall this is a huge, beautiful, clean home. Thanks. Everything was fine. Apartment as advertised. Smooth checkin/checkout. The house was perfect.  I was worried it would be too tight for 8 people, it was very spacious.  The unit was actually nicer than I expected, and the location was great!  Everyone was very happy with their stay and would highly recommend this option over local hotel choices. \\r\\n The house was perfect for us. It was just as described and was very spacious. It was in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood and was very convenient to what we wanted to do in Seattle.  The house was exactly as described! Lockbox was easy to access, lots of clean towels, really comfortable beds! Really felt like we had a cozy home of our own in Seattle for the weekend, and the neighborhood was beautiful! My family needed a place to live while we put our house up on the market.  The place suited my needs and is located on a quiet street.  Just to hit some of the other reviewers points:  Yes, it\\'s a duplex with shared walls, but the walls seemed thick.  The closest grocery store is either Trader Joes or Fred Meyers (if you go to Ballard Town and Country, it will be a much longer walk).  Slate coffee house has great coffee (and pastry) just a couple blocks down from the home.  Unit is on the older side, but everything was in working order.  Blair had fast e-mail response time and was able to quickly fix a minor problem we encountered! Our family stayed here for 2 nights and the accommodations were just great for our group.  The house was clean and spacious, in a nice quiet neighborhood.  Blair was great to work with.   We were on a weekend trip in Seattle with a family of 6 and the house was perfect for that ! Everything was tidy and clean, with enough kitchen supplies to cook a homemade meal. The patio behind the kitchen was so adorable ! Defn a positive experience :)  We had such a great time at Blair\\'s! The house was perfect! Amazing location and the house was clean and well taken care! Blair was very easy to communicate with and everything went flawlessly! Can\\'t wait to come to back to Seattle and stay here! This is a great house if you are traveling with family, it had plenty of space for the adults and we got a pack & play for my kid. Everything was super clean and the beds were really comfy (of so soft linen!)\\r\\nIt is in Ballard but not really close to the main cafes and restaurants and transit, you will need a car or do quite a bit of walking to get to places\\r\\nBlair was really easy to reach out to and responded to our requests right away The house was very nice and clean. Very relaxing. We had a really positive experience here! The host communicated well and the place was excellent - clean, spacious, and well equipped. We slept very well as the beds are comfy and the neighbourhood is quiet. \\r\\n\\r\\nA car is needed to explore downtown, but the local breweries, cafes and shops etc are easily walkable, and really enjoyable! \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a perfect base for us, from which to explore Seattle. We really enjoyed our stay! It was my very first Airbnb experience. Great space for the entire family with everything you would need to have a relaxing vacation.  It was wonderful and spacious. We would love to use this place again in the future.  Blair was quick to respond to every e-mail / text.  The house is nicely decorated, clean and had everything we needed for our three-night stay.  We walked to the local pizza restaurant for dinner on our first night and on our second night, we took the bus to downtown Ballard and enjoyed dessert at Hot Cakes Molten Chocolate Cakery!  We especially enjoyed eating a few meals outdoors in the backyard because we got to appreciate the great 80 degree weather we were lucky to have while in Seattle!   This was the first time using Airbnb, so I didn\\'t know what to expect.  We were quite pleased.  The house was spacious and well maintained.  The neighbourhood was good:  walkable and safe, near shops and restaurants. Blair was super responsive and the house suited our needs for a quick stay with 3 children on a road trip (they fought over the bunk beds downstairs!). We didn\\'t get a chance to explore the neighborhood but it seemed nice. The house got a little hot in warm weather.  We were hosting a friend reunion here and had a nice stay! The key pick-up was easy and seamless and the outdoor patio was a really nice space for grilling and hanging out. We also enjoyed that the house was located within walking distance to a great coffee shop (4 min walk) and to the restaurants and shops of Ballard Ave (about 25 min walk). The main challenge we had, was in staying cool/circulating air in the house. We visited Seattle during an unseasonably hot week and the house gets a lot of afternoon sun beating in through those lovely windows in the front. Since there is no A/C, there were a few fans provided, but not enough for every room and the house just seemed to hold the heat (even with daily process of making sure blinds were closed, closing windows during the day, opening them during the cooler evenings etc...) Also, the windows didn\\'t have screens on them, so there were some issues with bugs being attracted to the light from inside at night. We tried to make the most of it and realize the weather is not usually quite that hot, so its probably a non-issue most of the time. Other than that, we had a great stay!  Neighborhood is very residential - about 15 minutes to Pike\\'s Place, downtown etc.  Great book of local coffee, shops etc in the living room.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo a/c, so a bit hot in the current heat wave, but cooled at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot fancy, but great amount of space for our family of four. This home was in a great location and was super easy to find. Everything was as described and there was plenty of space should you need it. Ballard is a super fun area to explore and this location is perfect to see all of the great neighborhoods around it as well! The home was excellent!  I stayed there with a party of 9 and managed to fit everyone in comfortably.\\r\\nThere are a ton of great breweries, bars and restaurants within walking distance (or short Uber ride).\\r\\nBlair was very responsive and accommodated as needed. I could not have asked for more. Whoa!  This place was a lot better than the pictures let on. I was just expecting a place to sleep, but the house was gorgeous, the basement was FANTASTIC!  The neighbourhood was lovely as well. And, whoa this might sound nerdy, but their kitchen sink is the sexiest sink I ever used. I could wash dishes all day in that sink.  Whoa! Blair was responsive and helpful.  My large family traveled from all over the US and arrived at different times, most by cab.  Since we could not check in early, Blair allowed us to secure our luggage at the home until we could check in.  He responded immediately to any questions or concerns.  We rented both sides of this duplex for 12 adults and we each felt comfortable and had plenty of room to relax and have our own space.  The beds were comfortable and clean, as was the whole unit.  (I am quite obsessive about cleanliness, so this is an amazing fact!)  The kitchen was well appointed and the linen was also clean and ample.  The whole experience was really great.  We were all very impressed. House was clean and exactly as described. I didn\\'t meet the owner, but it was super easy to let myself in and lock up. Thank you! My friends and I were on a road trip ending in Seattle. We arrived earlier than expected and had to book quickly. Blair was extremely fast and flexible with us. The apartment was clean, quiet, and spacious. We really liked the backyard patio and the netflix in the living room.  The home is in a great location, a quick drive to Ballard and Fremont and perfect for families. When we arrived we were very disappointed, the house was very dirty, broken glass was on the floor outside and in a bedroom, hair everywhere on the floor, in the bathrooms and even on the linens. We immediately told Blair who has been very reactive, very helpful and a perfect host. Thanks to him everything was settled.\\n\\nThe house is nice though we could not eat all together because we were 6 adults and two kids and the table in the kitchen is for four only. If you plan to have a family dinner it isn\\'t really possible. Apartment was clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay and we will definitely use it on our next trip.  The house was clean and accessible and met our needs very well.  Blair\\'s house was the perfect accommodation for my group of 6. It was a close walking distance to the buses to take us into Ballard and downtown Seattle. We had a great time! Great house, great location and great host! The house is exactly as described. It was very cozy and fit our group perfectly. The big couch was great and made for a comfy and inviting living room. The outdoor patio was perfect for my girlfriends and I to sit outside, where we chatted and enjoyed a lovely Seattle summer evening. Bedrooms were clean and spacious. The house is very close to both Fremont and Ballard, and within walking distance to bars, restaurants and coffee shops. Highly recommend! Perfect location and very clean house. upon arrival, we contacted the host via email and he responded imediately. Great experience at Walkable in Seattle. It worked perfect for us.  Blair’s place certainly meets the expectations of location location.\\r\\nThe house has all you need in terms of amenities and also Blair was great at communicating with us. Although we were not there very long, we enjoyed our stay. Casa muy bonita y acogedora, de excelente tamaño, el host estuvo muy pendiente y contesto nuestras dudas y aclaraciones.  Very comfortable and clean. All amenities needed were available. Very roomy and comfortable beds. We really enjoyed the Ballard neighborhood! The house is cute, but super simple and without any extras so be sure to bring some starter items for the fridge, water etc. it was nice to have a pack and play there too, but the wood floors are super creaky so if you have a light sleeper bring a portable sound machine. Our host was responsive to feedback and responded in a timely manner.  Overall we had a great experience. The house was exactly as advertised and Blair was extremely organized and easy to work with. I would recommend the house to anyone looking to stay in the Ballard area.  The host\\'s itinerary made it very easy to figure out how to get into the house and places to visit in the neighborhood. It was a great location, walking distance to many fun restaurants, shops and more. This was a great location. Easy walking distance to a great coffee shop and restaurant as well as the bus that takes you into downtown Ballard. We really enjoyed the space, which was comfortable and clean. The host helped us even though we forgot to look into directions provided to check in. The apartment is nice one and was good for four of us.  Great space for my wife\\'s 30th birthday surprise. Relaxing evening overall in a comfortable space! Plenty of fridge space to make ourselves comfortable and supply what we needed. Blair was a superb host and allowed us to collect some items we had left behind in our rush to check out and go to our hotel accommodation. The house was beautiful and very well situated for easy access to downtown and other local shops. Try the giddy up burger 10mins walk away - they\\'re awesome! Location and size of the house is great. Very quiet and situated neighbourhood. Wish could have spend more days. The house was perfect for what we needed and is as described. Blair was quick to respond to any questions and would stay in one of his properties again. The house was in a good neighbourhood and has a fantastic small coffee shop at the end of the street which did great espresso which Seattle is known for. Its a drive to Ballard area which has many top restaurants and bars. Nice quiet and safe location. Very clean. Great stay The home is in a great quiet neighborhood. It was easy to check in and check out and the place was immaculate. Altogether, staying there was a great experience. Awesome rental.  My family and I spent 5 days here and had a great stay.  This townhouse was in a great neighborhood with excellent pizza and coffee a few blocks away.  A short drive to great places to eat as well as Ala Mode Pie shop :) Definitely recommend staying here is you are traveling with children.   It was a very smooth check in & check out process. Blair explained everything prior to my arrival and helpful. the apt is very close to downtown seattle and lots of parking around the neighborhood. The apt had everything we needed during our stay. Would recommend! Great house. Blair was extremely helpful with all questions and difficulties. Blair contacted me before arriving that morning to tell me about check-in and to orient me to the house. The house was freshly cleaned and located in a cute neighborhood close to downtown Ballard. The beds are comfortable and the appliances are updated. Everything was a short walk or drive away. Overall, the experience was positive and it was a cozy house to stay the night. Michael and Jean Louise have created a very stylish, spacious and comfortable retreat in Ballard.  My first stay with Air B n B was a hit.  I was looking for a place of my own that was walking distance to everything in Ballard and Fremont.  This place was perfectly situated between the two areas of town.  The apartment is  really spacious with a very comfortable bed and fresh flowers designed by Jean Louise.  A special highlight for colder Seattle days is a working fireplace and on sunny days a small yard out the back.\\r\\n\\r\\nJean Louise and Mike are really welcoming and easy going and there small son Cash is delightful.  I\\'ll definitely go back. Great very large apartment with great hosts.  The little touches were much appreciated quaility breakfast provisions provided, nice soaps and lotions in the bathroom.  This is a well decorated, comfortable and private apartment, the hosts live just upstairs but were respectful of my privacy and were also on hand to answer any questions I had and are just lovely people.  The bus to Fremont & downtown is just around the corner and the Ballard bus just a few blocks away. It is quite easy to get around without a car and it was lovely to come back to this cozy apartment at the end of the day.  Thanks Mike & Jean Louise!! I\\'m very satisfied with my choice of where to stay on my trip to Seattle.  We enjoyed using all the amenities they had to offer! I found myself excited to go back and relax after a day out. I really liked that the main living room and bedroom were separate versus most hotels, so if you\\'re an early riser you won\\'t wake up your partner! Not only was the place great, but so were the hosts! We had all the privacy we wanted, but if we wanted or needed anything Mike & Jean Louise were there to help. I\\'m hoping to make another trip to stay here:)  I had a wonderful time at this beautifully decorated apartment. Michael and his family are sweet and friendly and the location is great! I\\'ll definitely stay here again. Jean Louise and Michael were welcoming and delightful hosts. They made sure we had what we needed but respected our privacy.  The apartment was so comfortable that we simply felt that we were \"home\" every night during our 1-month stay to visit with family. \\r\\n  During the rainy cold days of December, the energy-efficient wood-burning fireplace in the living room was a real bonus that we enjoyed frequently. \\r\\n    We will not hesitate to stay again -- assuming they have a space on the calendar for us.  I have to say we hesitated to write such a glowing review, knowing it will probably mean they will be booked solid from now on. As this was our first experience with Airbnb it is safe to say that Michael and his family set the bar very high.  They were so  welcoming even though we got in a little earlier than expected.  Their neighborhood and home are beautiful and we were impressed before we even saw the inside of the apartment.  Inside we found a  very spacious and comfortable living space.  Everything was very clean and most important very comfortable.  They have thought of everything a guest could need and provided very nice amenities.  \\r\\nWe utilized the fireplace every day and the jacuzzi tub was an awesome bonus.  \\r\\nOverall they were excellent hosts and helped us out quite a bit providing information on public transportation and Michael even offered to drive us to the market in the snow.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe would recommend this place to anybody visiting Seattle. \\r\\n We were happy to stay in Mike and Jean Louise’s apartment. We were doing internships in Seattle and stayed there for four months. We liked the neighbourhood and the hosts are very helpful. Michael, Jean Louise and Cash were perfect hosts. The apartment was clean, roomy and well appointed. The location, halfway between Fremont and Ballard, was great. I would highly recommend this stay to anyone.  The basement apartment in Michael\\'s family\\'s home was a great first experience for us.  Clean, neat, many conveniences, and plenty of room for our kids to run around.  We will definitely use airbnb again and stay at this home again if the opportunity presents itself. Stayed at their apartment for 2 days while visiting town for work/pleasure, it was an awesome experience! The apartment has everything you might need and is in a great location between Fremont and Ballard. Mike and Jean Louise\\'s place is exactly why I love airbnb! Great accommodation in a vibrant neighborhood with fun and interesting hosts. The apartment is clean and spacious, tastefully decorated, plenty of room for my girlfriend, her sister and I to spread out and make ourselves comfortable after spending a week on a cruise ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s a nice backyard that we shared with our hosts, their adorable 4-year old Cash, and Guinness the dachshund. If you\\'re feeling social and want to find out about some local hangouts or a general Seattle vibe, they\\'re open to chat anytime, but if you prefer to keep to yourself, it\\'s okay too. We happened to be there on a Sunday night when their neighbors came over for a BBQ, and hanging out and participating in the locals\\' life ended up being one of the highlights of our stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, being within walking distance of Ballard and Fremont, you could pretty much be gone all day and never get bored. So many great restaurants, bars and markets (yummy Veraci Pizza is just a couple of blocks up the street!). And it having been summer, just walking through the neighborhood with all the amazing flowers and vegetable gardens everywhere is a total bonus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a cool place to stay. Thank you Jean Louise and Mike for making us feel like your neighbors for a weekend! Mike and Jean, together with their little son Cash, have served as excellent host. Their house is well-decorated and clean, exactly as illustrated in the photo gallery on Airbnb website. They checked with us our exact time of check-in and check-out and are very flexible and tolerant with our schedule. They are always there to help yet respect our privacy. Plus, the fireplace in the house is definitely a bonus to warm us up in this raining season. \"Cozy, convenient and artistic\", this place is definitely a perfect choice. I would highly recommend Mike and Jean\\'s house and would love to stay there again! This was the first time we have ever used Air BNB and we will definitely be using it again because of such a great experience.  The place was very well kept, clean, and spacious.  They have everything we could need and more for our stay.  It\\'s was so much better than staying in a hotel because we felt like we were coming home at the end of a long day.  Mike, Jean Louise and Cash were great hosts!  They were so friendly, which just helped make our trip that much better.  We would recommend their place to anyone! The apartment was quiet, clean, cozy, and has a very comfy bed.  Michael was incredibly accommodating!   I would not hesitate to stay here again.   This is a wonderful place to stay!  Michael and Jean Louise were so friendly and communicative, going above and beyond to help me with some special requests.  I really appreciated the organic treats, selection of bath products, and special touches like floral arrangements and organic bath towels.  This is a basement apt. so expect to hear some activity above.  The apt. itself was immaculate and very comfortable.  Would love to stay here again; it was my best airbnb experience thus far.   Michael and his family were warm, welcoming and relaxed hosts. After camping in the woods, I enjoyed having such friendly faces available in the backyard for chatting. Their eye for design was evident in the apartment and the lovely flower arrangements in the rooms.  Overall, the place is spacious and conveniently located for exploring Ballard and the surrounding neighborhoods.   We had a great time! Michael and his family were very welcoming! Will stay again next time we\\'re in Seattle :) We had a great stay with Michael, Jean Louise and Cash. It was like staying with friends - but without feeling like an imposition. They were welcoming and friendly and very laid-back. My son and Cash really hit it off and spent a lot of time playing together. The apartment had everything we needed for our 3-night stay - fresh eggs and butter in the fridge, plenty of kitchen items to make a meal - and we both enjoyed having our own spaces to sleep in.\\r\\n \\r\\nI wish we could have stayed longer and look forward to visiting again. This place was perfect. Very clean, great neighborhood, easy commute to downtown and excellent hosts. Michael and his family are very accommodating and a wealth of local information. I would stay here again in a moment.  Convenient, clean, private, super easy to settle into. Nice big kitchen, easy to cook in, comfortable bed. Great location for us - in the popular Freemont/Ballard area.  Easy on street parking.  Absolutely wonderful hosts, and their son Cash is a joy. Would definitely stay there again (and hope we WILL do so) and highly recommend. I had a wonderful stay at this Ballard Apartment. I was travelling for work so didn\\'t get to spend much time hanging out, but the hosts were lovely and very helpful.  The house was immaculately clean, the bathroom has an amazing shower, and they even left me some organic eggs for making breakfast. The location is also very nice, it is a quick walk to downtown Ballard and close to a really nice running trail along the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall it was a top notch stay, I\\'m sure I will be back when my travels bring me to Seattle. Our stay with Michael, Jean-Louise, Cash and Guinness could not have been better.  They are such nice people (and dog) and their apartment was just the touch of home we were looking for on our trip to Seattle for a wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey met us with smiles and all the information we needed for a great time.  The parking was easy on the street in front of their home.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe.  Mike and Jean-Louise had fresh eggs, half and half, juice, butter and freshly ground coffee waiting for us in the nicely appointed kitchen.  That was really a nice touch that made us feel very welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bedroom was great with a walk-in closet and a comfortable queen-size bed.  And since Jean-Louise is a florist there were beautiful flowers everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur son slept on a very comfortable futon in the living room in front of the fireplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the bathroom we enjoyed the jacuzzi tub (Cash had showed us how it worked), the rain shower head and the ample assortment of shampoos and shower gels.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe happened to arrive on some of the hottest days Seattle had this year, but the apartment stayed cool and comfortable, day and night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe found that the location of the apartment in Ballard/Fremont was very convenient to good eats, great sights, interesting shops and all the tourist attraction \"must sees\".  Our only problem was that we didn\\'t have enough time to do it all since we were there for the wedding of dear friends.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'ll just have to come back...and when we do, we\\'ll hope to stay with Mike, Jean-Louise, Cash and Guinness again. The apartment at Ballard / Fremont was a pleasure to visit. It was neat and very clean and charmingly decorated, even including fresh flowers. Our hosts were charming and thoughtful. We were able to enjoy coffee and juice on our arrival thanks to their thoughtfulness. We had everything we needed and even the luxury of a washer and drier. The neighbourhood is quiet and within easy access of the Ballard locks and gardens. We would absolutely visit again. Thank you. We got in late and Jean Louise was very nice, accommodating, and hospitable (plus, the little boy, Cash, is awesome). The place was exactly what we were looking for, and it was very cozy and clean. Parking was plentiful, and getting in and out was easy. This was my wife and I\\'s first AirBnb experience and it was definitely a win.  This was my first time using airbnb and I had a pleasant experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friends and I had a wonderful stay with Michael, Jean-Louise, and Cash. We arrived much later than expected, but everything was ready when we got there. The apartment itself was quiet, clean, and comfortable, and our hosts were friendly and welcoming! Highly recommend their place to anyone!\\r\\n\\r\\n(My friends and I were traveling for fun and we did not have a car, but their apartment was very close to a bus stop. Very convenient!) We had a lovely stay, we have a 1 year old and we were able to set up her Graco play pen in the large walk-in closet so it was like she had her own room. It worked out really well having all the space and having a kitchen made it a lot easier than staying in a hotel. Our daughter also liked playing outside with Cash and he was so sweet to share his toys with her.  The large Ballard/Freemont apartment was a perfect way to ease back into the City after a couple days of camping on the Olympic Peninsula.  I didn\\'t get a chance to meet Mike and Jean Louise (they were off camping too) but they reached out a week in advance with all the details, and left a lovely note, restaurant/activity recommendations, and some local treats (fresh eggs and blueberries) for me in the apartment.  And the apartment is adorable, with lots of space, pretty decorations, and loads of fresh-cut flowers.  It was so welcoming!  It has a great kitchen area, super comfy bed, wi-fi, a nice, clean bathroom (with lots of shampoo/conditioner), ample street parking and laundry to boot!  It was my first experience using Air B\\'n\\'B and I couldn\\'t have had a better one! Jean Louise, Mike, Cash and Guinness made us feel welcome from the outset. The apartment was clean, comfortable, spacious and well equipped including a welcome pack of some eatables to get us started. \\xa0The cut flowers were a nice touch too!\\xa0Jean Louise and Mike were really helpful and couldn\\'t do enough for us.\\r\\nIt was a really peaceful neighbourhood and \\xa0well situated for the bus route for Fremont and downtown.\\xa0\\r\\nWould recommend without hesitation.\\xa0\\r\\nCaroline and Adam Wood This place was great, good location. Mike and Jean was really nice to us. I was surprise that all amenities that you really need for a long stay was provided. The house is fully equip with bedding, toiletries and kitchen equipments. What I really love most was that the cable TV have almost all the channels that I want to watch. I would love to come back again!  Two friends and I stayed at this adorable place when in town for a wedding - everything was perfect! Location is great, plenty to do within walking distance. The basement unit is cozy, with plenty of natural light and all the furnishings you\\'d want.  My boyfriend, Dikkie and I stayed for four days and three nights when in Fremont for a leadership program. The apartment was great, all of the things one needs to feel welcome and at home away from home are here. Michael and Ninja Cash greeted us and got us settled in. If you are looking for a lovely place to call home while in the area stay here. We enjoyed meeting our hosts, the apartment and location.  It is evident they want to ensure you have an enjoyable stay. Other details that are great about the place: amazing comfortable bed, relaxing living room with wifi and direct TV, jet bath, coffee maker, coffee and tea selections, laundry room...You\\'ll be happy you booked the place. We were and would stay again!  My boys and I had a relaxing weekend in this very comfortable and tasteful retreat. Michael greeted us and had everything set up nicely. I appreciate JL\\'s floral designs around the house and in the yard. Too bad it was raining all weekend otherwise we could have taken advantage of the yard and covered patio area and had an outdoor meal, and perhaps my boys could have played with Cash in the back yard. The house was a perfect home base for our Ballard getaway and easy to get to: Golden Gardens; Ballard Locks; and the Farmer\\'s Market. We even discovered the Greenwood area.The organic coffee and blueberries were nice amenities My friend and I stayed for 3 nights while we were in town of a girls\\' weekend.  Comfy and private apartment with plenty of hot water in the shower and great water pressure.  Location was great - a decent walk to the Ballard neighborhood.  Mike and Jean Louise were very thoughtful with the small touches that make a big difference: a few breakfast essentials ready when we arrived, and a basket of toiletries for us to use during our stay.  Although we didn\\'t have a car with us, our friend who met up with us always found a place to park when she picked us up & dropped us off. super convenient to where I needed to be each day\\r\\nbreakfast food in the fridge upon arrival\\r\\neverything else as described-- great spot! We just came home from a four night stay at Michael and his family\\'s apartment in Seattle.  It was the perfect place for our family while on vacation.  We were traveling with our four month old and having our own place was key and SO much better than having stayed in a hotel.  It was really homey, they even lent us their pack and play so we didn\\'t have to lug ours.  Having laundry was amazing with all of  the spit ups and diaper explosions that babies have.  We used the fireplace and the jacuzzi tub to relax.  The bedroom gets very dark, which is also key with a baby. We made use of the kitchen, had coffee every morning.  They literally have everything you could need - dishes and silverware and glasses and laundry detergent, coffee, sugar - there were eggs, orange juice and half and half in the fridge when we got there.  It was very cozy and cute.  I would recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle.   We had an incredible 3 and a half month stay at Mike\\'s Ballard apartment. Mike and Jean Louise are warm and friendly- always around to help but respectful of our privacy. Their son Cash is chatty and fun. We are new to Seattle and used the house as a base for house-hunting. The home-buying process was stressful so it was nice to not have to worry about our temporary housing; Mike was flexible and accommodating of our ever-shifting move-out date. They even sent us off with a house-warming gift! The apartment itself is a nice size with fast internet, a million TV channels and a well-equipped kitchen. It is in a cute neighborhood- walking distance to the Ballard and Fremont commercial districts and across the street from a bus stop that goes right into downtown. We highly recommend this apartment for short and long stays. It\\'s been a great stay at Michael\\'s apartment! Everything is just as it was described on AirBnB and we were very happy about the place itself and the location. Easy transfer to Downtown and the best starting point to explore a lovely neighborhood. Michael and his family are great hosts and we enjoyed staying with them. Thanks a lot! Lovely stay with Michael. He welcomed us with freshly baked blueberry-banana muffins. The place was clean and tidy. I would stay there again! I was moving to Seattle for work and stayed here for 1 month whilst looking for a long term apartment. The place is great! Everything you could need is there, the location is ideal and close to public transport AND the family is amazing and SUPER helpful... I HIGHLY recommend staying here. Really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was comfortable and well equiped and Michael and his family were very considerate hosts. Location was great for us as it was near friends we were visiting and the Ballard area had many good restaurants and groceries close by. We had a car and our trips into downtown were pretty quick. Definitely a place we would stay again should we get back to Seattle.    We stayed three nights in this lovely apartment. The area was great, plenty of parking on the street. The family was very welcoming and willing to answer any of our questions. Mike and Jean Louise were so friendly and their son was very sweet. The place very comfortably accommodated three adults. Little touches like orange juice and eggs and coffee in the fridge for us were so thoughtful and appreciated. I would absolutely stay there when passing through Seattle again and would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable and homey apartment.  We had a great 2-night stay in Michael and Jean Louise\\'s apartment. The location is fantastic with east access to Ballard, Fremont and Wallingford. The apartment itself was very comfortable and homey with everything we needed over the course of the weekend. We were traveling with our 4-month-old daughter and they provided a pack-n-play for our use (as those who travel with children know, the less stuff you have to lug around the better!) Michael and Jean Louise were great - welcoming without being over bearing and always ready with answers to our questions or recommendations on places to check out. We\\'ll definitely be back! We had a wonderful time on our visit to Seattle and staying at the Allen\\'s home was perfect for us! The neighborhood is idyllic and the company was great! It was nice to visit with them and our son had so much fun playing with their son - who is probably the coolest 5yr old I know!\\r\\nI highly recommend staying here if you need a place to stay while in the Seattle area. The restaurants in the area are unforgettable as well. Thank you to Michael, jean-Louise and cash for the great visit.\\r\\nGina, Jeremy, and Aidan  The apt. was clean, spacious, and convenient. The bed was very comfortable too. The host was very friendly. Michael and his wife are fantastic! The place is incredibly nice, and the pictures are 100% what you can expect. Though it is a basement unit, they have taken great care to make it a fully-functioning apartment unit, and we never heard so much as a footstep from the floor above! The hosts are accommodating and welcoming, and clearly respected our space (but were there if we needed anything). I highly, highly recommend staying here! The apartment was perfect! There were lots of nice little touches -- coffee, creamer, a hair dryer, and more! The apartment gave us lots of room so we didn\\'t feel crowded. Every room was squeaky clean: I was very impressed! The wireless internet was excellent! The owners, who live above, were super helpful if help was needed, and left us alone the rest of the time. We had a little tiny bit of difficulty finding the place the first time, but after that, we discovered that the location is excellent. Easy to get around to and from, with great restaurants close by. I would HIGHLY recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Seattle!! Michael and his family were the ideal hosts. We felt extremely welcomed and comfortable. Communication was open and easy. I would recommend this vacation rental to any of my friends and family. We fully intend to stay here again if a situation arises where we need a place to stay in Seattle for more than a few days. Great experience!!!! Great basement suite, large and comfortable, has everything we needed for our 3 night stay. Michael, Jean Louise, and Cash were very friendly and wonderful hosts. A great location and such a positive experience!! We were a family of three and stayed for 2 weeks.  This is a very convenient and comfortable apartment.  Michael was very helpful and since they were having a flower shop as business and therefore most of the day, there were either Michael or his wife stayed at the gargage.  Therefore we are able to get information or talk to them.  During the stay, our rental car was impounded. That was most likely because we parked too close to the driveway of the neighbor\\'s house.  Parking on the street is always full and it seems to me that his neighbors were not that friendly. Other than that, everything seems perfect to us.  I would recommend it to anyone. Great place to stay.  Michael was very accommodating.  Convenient to downtown and very close to the Ballard Locks. We just returned from a wonderful stay in Seattle. Michael and Jean Louise were great hosts -- communication prior to our arrival was easy and prompt, and they were available for questions during our stay, too. They also left a helpful list of restaurants, grocery stores, and local attractions in the apartment, which was great!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment was a perfect size for us (two adults and an infant), and the location is ideal. I would highly recommend this apartment! Michael and Jean Louise were fantastic hosts. Very pleasant and accommodating. Their space was extremely clean, quaint and cozy. We were fortunate to have some of the most beautiful weather in Seattle and it was nice to sit out in their cute little backyard and soak up the sun.  As per Micheal’s suggestion, we explored the trendy Ballard Ave (10 min walk) with it’s amazing restaurants and bars, and had some of the best oysters we’ve ever had. Check-in and check-out was effortless. We would highly recommend this property for your stay in the Seattle area.  Very convenient and pleasant place to stay. It was clean, roomy and had everything we needed. Hosts were helpful. The flowers were beautiful. We would stay here again.  > Communication with Michael was very good.  The apartment was much like the photos.  The walk- in closet really helped to keep us organized.  All rooms were good size.  The bed and futon were comfortable.  We did not have a car, so the bus stops close by were great.  It was a nice walk into Ballard.  Some walking routes in the area did not seem as nice, so it\\'s a good idea to be aware ahead of time. Michael and his wife and sweet 5 year old son live above.  We heard them moving around sometimes, mostly in the early morning when their son would wake up, or early evening. This was not a problem for us, but just want to let people know.  Keep in mind, this is a basement apartment, so there are few windows.  A screen on the bedroom window would have been nice so that we could have opened it for air.  The tv remote control needs to be replaced.  There are a few other cosmetic things that could be mentioned, but the price we paid was good, and we felt we got our money\\'s worth.  The washing machine and dryer were a bonus and both worked great.  As mentioned by others, lots of things are provided in the kitchen and bathroom to make your stay easier.  One last thing... if you won\\'t have a car, get a street map of Seattle before you arrive.  We tried and tried, all over the place, to locate one and could not.  The visitor centers we visited did not have them.  GPS will get you wherever you want to go, but we still wanted to see the overview of where we were coming from / traveling to.  Too late we realized the downtown library would probably have had some that we could make copies of.  We\\'ve traveled to many large cities, never had this problem and didn\\'t think we had to bring one with us.  Last recommendation for Michael - if guests will not be bringing a car, have street maps for them in the apartment, as well as current bus schedules for the bus stops located nearby.\\r\\n Great location for us during our visit to Seattle while visiting our son who lives in Ballard.  We enjoyed the closeness of grocery stores and good dining. The accommodations are not fancy, but perfectly adequate, clean, and  convenient.  Michael is a welcoming, low key host. Michael was a great host! He stayed up to meet us as we had a late flight, even though he had said he might just leave the key out so we could let ourselves in. The apartment was lovely and comfortable, the kitchen fully equipped (very helpful since we have a 1-year-old and didn\\'t want to eat out for every meal!), and Michael even let us borrow their pack n play so we didn\\'t have to bring one for our daughter to sleep in. We also had our mother-in-law with us for part of our vacation to help with the baby when we went to a wedding, and Michael did not charge us for having an extra person for part of our stay. He answered all of our questions promptly, his whole family was very friendly, and made our first time using AirBnB a great success! We love this apartment - comfortable, secure, clean, convenient, perfect size for 3 adults, great hosts!  The best part is the large & fully equipped kitchen since we love to cook and wanted to eat all the local, in season food available at the Ballard markets and surrounding areas. Another plus is the washer/dryer just for our use, inside the apartment - just like home, and the beautiful flowers we could see everyday in their flower shop.  The street parking can be a little crowded depending on the time you\\'re coming back.  We definitely will stay with the Allen\\'s again! Michael and Jean-Louise\\'s apartment was charming, roomy and clean. My husband and were able to walk half a block to the bus and even do some laundry in the apartment. Soap, extra blankets and basic cooking ingredients were provided. There was even a fireplace with a fire starter log and firewood. Overall we very much enjoyed our stay and will remember them if we make it back to Seattle again. We are more than pleased with our stay with Michael and Jean Louise.\\r\\nThey have a well appointed apartment in their home and we enjoyed our stay with them.\\r\\nWe had everything that we needed and we felt very comfortable during our stay with them.\\r\\nWe look forward to staying with them again if they have the time available when we are in Seattle. The basement apartment was  spotless, albet a little less quiet than i expected. If your a light sleeper and like to sleep in, you can hear noises from above you. If that is NOT a problem for you; the apartment, and privacy is clean, private and comfortable. My host was very kind and amenable. I will be back!  Great location.   Awesome hosts.   Large, comfortable space.   Would definitely stay here again.   We had a fantastic stay at this fabulous apartment!!! Communication with Michael & Jean Louise was easy and they were very responsive to any questions we had. The apartment was perfect! It was spotless and looked exactly like the pictures on Airbnb. It had everything we needed and Jean Louse even left us eggs and cream for the morning and a nice bottle of wine for the evening. The location worked well for us and we never had a problem with parking. We highly recommend this Ballard apartment and we will stay here again in the future!!!\\r\\nThanks Michael & Jean Louise We really enjoyed staying at Michael\\'s place in Ballard. Spacious and comfortable and has everything you\\'ll need for a short or long stay (nice kitchen, washer/dryer, comfortable bed, and pull-out couch). The herbal tea and a bottle of wine were a nice touch that we fully enjoyed. The house is well situated, near good restaurants and access to  the 99 and 5 freeways. We will stay here again. We had a wonderful stay at Michael\\'s apartment. The place was immaculate and the bed super comfy with tons of pillows (just how I like it!). We loved having a full kitchen where we could fix meals, and there\\'s a Trader Joe\\'s just a short drive away. Michael was a very kind and considerate host and recommended some great restaurants.  All the comforts of home, with just about every amenity imagineable! My wife and I stayed here for all of January 2014, and have no regrets.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a comfortable basement suite, with a private entrance. The helpful and friendly owners live upstairs. We were able to park on the street, usually very close, sometimes just at the end of the block.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst impressions were excellent: Fresh cupcakes, a bag of locally roasted coffee, a bar of local chocolate, a bottle of wine... We appreciated little touches like the pint beer glass in the freezer. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment has a comfortable couch, TV with Netflix and cable, reliable WiFi, and a bedroom with a large closet. The private laundry machines worked well. There\\'s a fireplace too.  The kitchen is pretty good, with a large fridge, stove, microwave, coffee maker, and cooking equipment.  We cooked and ate in the apartment all month without serious limitations. The bathroom is also good and the bathtub has water jets.  The bedroom is quiet and dark for sleeping. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s not much negative to say... it is a basement suite, and so as you\\'d expect, during the Seattle winter it can be a bit dark, and can get chilly if it\\'s really cold outside. However, it isn\\'t completely underground. There are windows that you can see out of and allow some direct sunlight in, and some effective heaters.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe owners upstairs were available to help, although we didn\\'t have many problems. One night Netflix glitched and required a re-login, and they came down and fixed it immediately. Thanks!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bottom line is this was a comfortable and very practical place to live for a month.  We recommend it.\\r\\n I\\'ve never used Airbnb. My brother recommended this site. Jean-Louise, Michael and Cash were great hosts. It\\'s hard staying a week in a hotel. This was my own clean, cozy place, to come home to every night. This wonderful family left me coffee, cookies, wine and the list goes on. I will definitely recommend and go back to visit this great family. The single best Airbnb experience we\\'ve had. The space was gorgeous, the amenities were fantastic, the owners were extremely friendly and went above and beyond (they run a flower shop and left flowers in the apartment for my girlfriend, since we flew in on Valentine\\'s Day; also, we were running late for a wedding and they were gracious enough to wrap our wedding gift as we got ready)... also, the neighborhood is great. We\\'d love to stay here again. A very cozy and comfortable apartment!  Everything you need has been provided by the welcoming hosts.  Lovely neighborhood, too.  I would not hesitate to stay here again! The property was nice and spacious and is in a pleasant location.  It was easy to find, and it was not overly difficult to find parking along the street.  There was plenty of room for my friend and me.  There were beautiful cut flowers throughout the apartment, and Michael was considerate to leave half-and-half, eggs, and coffee for us; he even printed out a list of all of the microbreweries within walking distance, since he knew we were interested in craft beer!  This is a wonderful property, and I would not hesitate to stay here again.  Thanks again! Michael, Jean-Louise, and Cash welcomed me warmly. I stayed an entire month, sometimes bringing my 5 month old grandson over to enjoy their backyard in the afternoon and thereby having the opportunity to enjoy Cash and his friends as they played in the yard. Once Cash even rushed into the house to put on a costume for my enjoyment! I felt like part of the family as I discussed plant care with Jean-Louise or watched as she created some floral magic. \\r\\nOther reviews will let you in on all the amenities of the apartment, all of which were wonderful. I loved feeling like I was coming home each evening rather than to a rental. Thank you all for being so friendly. Our experience at Michael\\'s space was absolutely amazing! He was very accommodating, helping us arrange transportation to and from the airport, giving us advice on nearby eateries, encouraging us on a business venture we were undertaking while in Seattle, and helping us deal with a luggage malfunction problem on our last night! He was accessible when we needed him but otherwise hands-off, which was perfect. The space is wonderful and peaceful. The bed was so comfortable and the entire apartment was very clean and spacious. We were greeted with fresh flowers all around the apartment, and homemade cupcakes and a bottle of wine in the kitchen. I could not have asked for a more enjoyable stay! Michael and Jean Louise were great hosts. The space was just as advertised and a nice alternative to a hotel. We really appreciated the little touches of the eggs and coffee in the kitchen, the soaps in the bathroom, a bottle of wine, and I love that there was a throw blanket to curl up under on the couch. We were out and about most of our stay, but felt comfortable and safe while there. It was also great to have access to a washer and dryer! Normally over a weekend, I don\\'t worry about that, our 2yr old had a mishap at Molly Moons and it was nice to take care of all of the sticky clothing and blanket right away. Thank you!  Host was awesome This was our first airbnb experience and I did not expect it to be so perfect. They had everything that we could possibly need: lots of shampoo and conditioner to choose from, eggs, coffee and cream in the fridge, a pack and play for our son, a bottle of wine, and even freshly baked cookies! \\r\\n\\r\\nNote for parents: There\\'s a walk-in closet that fits the pack and play perfectly. Spacious, comfortable, private retreat in a great section of Seattle. Michaels place is exactly as pictured. What you can\\'t see is the hospitality in the form of their graciousness, guidebook, baked goods, fresh cut flowers, organic eggs, coffee, cream and toiletries.  This is a private, spacious, comfortable, safe space to stay.  It\\'s a short, easy drive to every where in Seattle and even Tacoma. Ballard and Fremont are funky, fun areas of Seattle. Very close to the Ballard locks and the best coffee in Seattle - ETG coffee and bakery in Fremont. I highly recommend this place  Mike & Jean Louise\\'s space provides you with all the amenities of staying at a hotel or B&B with a personalized twist with fresh flowers, baked cookies and a bottle of wine. The space is comfortable, their backyard environment is lovely, and they take special care to make sure we have everything you need, including basic toiletries, coffee & tea, and plenty of pillows and blankets. We stayed here for a family vacation during Memorial Day week and it was so generous of them to open their personal space to us considering the holiday. Jean Louise also whipped up the most gorgeous floral arrangement in her studio for a last minute gift for a friend who owns a local restaurant. We would definitely stay here again if given the opportunity and would recommend it highly to all of our friends & family visiting Seattle.     Michael and Jean Louise were really nice hosts, and considerate people. They thought of everything, fresh flowers and plants, earplugs, netflix access in their TV. , neighborhood guide. The apartment looks just like the photos. The beds were very comfortable, even the futon that turns into a bed for a third guest was comfortable. We really enjoyed their place, and would definitely recommend it.  My parents and I stayed in Michael and his wife\\'s apartment for a couple of nights while in Seattle on a business trip.  Michael and Jay Louise were extremely gracious and hospitable hosts, providing us with complimentary coffee, wine, and various other staples, and advice about the area.  Their downstairs apartment is very nice with and comfortable with everything a traveler could ask for.  The neighborhood is very nice and quiet yet close to many attractions, restaurants and bars.  I would definitely recommend staying with the Allens when visiting Seattle. My wife and I enjoyed our stay of 4 nights in June.  Michael was great at communicating during the rental process and was there to check us in when we arrived.  The apartment was very comfortable and had everything we needed.  We didn\\'t do any cooking, but did use the fridge and washer/dryer which was a big plus.  The bed was very soft and we slept well after long days of walking around.  My wife also took advantage of the jacuzzi tub to relax.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment is really close to the #28 bus to downtown which was convenient.  It\\'s not right in center of Ballard, but we were still able to walk to check out the Sunday farmer\\'s market, shops, restaurants, and the locks.  We definitely liked the Ballard area.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn\\'t have any issues with the rental and would definitely stay again! We booked this apartment based on location (we wanted to stay outside of downtown, in one of the neighborhoods) and the numerous great reviews.  It lived up to expectations!  The hosts were friendly and knowledgeable, and gave us our privacy.  Minimal noise heard upstairs from their little boy ;)  The apartment itself, was spotless, with all amenities.  As in prior reviews, the bottle of wine and cookies were fantastic.  We had a car and finding parking on-street was easy.  Right between Ballard and Fremont restaurants, cafes, shops, so a great location, although it\\'s not right outside your door.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had to note any drawbacks (since you can already tell from previous reviews that this is overall a great place to stay), it would be that it IS the basement and that it could be updated more (but you can also tell that from all the photos posted). This is all just personal preference.  Other than that, we had a great experience here!   Had a very positive experience with Michael and his family.  I reserved his apartment for my family to stay in for my husband\\'s graduation weekend.  The apartment was lovely and it was in a quiet neighborhood in Frelard.  It was spacious, cheerful and well decorated.  Michael baked cookies for my parents prior to their arrival and left a bottle of wine, which was very kind.  My parents were a bit worried about finding street parking, but it was no problem at all.  The shower and jet tub were wonderful amenities to have in the apartment.  The bed and futon with memory foam cover were very comfortable to sleep on.  However, I would like to note that all of the furniture is low to the ground, which can be difficult to get in and out of for taller individuals.  He also put together a nice book of restaurants/places to visit.  Based on those recommendations, we tried two new restaurants in the Ballard area and had delicious meals.  What a cozy place to stay! Excellent stay with Michael and family! The apartment was just as pictured/described, impeccably clean, with some very thoughtful amenities (fresh baked cookies, lovely sheets/towels, toiletries) that made the visit feel like home. Highly recommended apartment with great hosts in the best part of Seattle.  Thank you for the hospitality!   Michael and his family were a pleasure to stay with!  The apartment was exactly as posted and our hosts exceeded our expectations with all the extra amenities.  We were greeted with homemade chocolate chip cookies, and breakfast staples in the fridge along with excellent coffee and wine.      The apt. was very clean and well appointed for our needs.  Michael offered suggestions for dining out and visiting local breweries. We felt very comfortable and thank Michael and his family for sharing their space with us.  \\r\\nThis apt is in a Ballard neighborhood where parking can be a bit of an issue.  There are restaurants and breweries within walking distance.    Michael and Jean Louise were both awesome---we can\\'t say enough about how great the space was, how accommodating they were, and how much we would recommend their apartment to others. It was obvious that they both went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Everything was perfect! Michael and Jean Louise were very welcoming and helpful, and we had an enjoyable stay in their basement apartment. The neighborhood was perfect for our needs - quiet yet close to restaurants and representative of the Seattle lifestyle. Overall a very comfortable stay. Michael was a pleasure from the beginning, he was so responsive whenever we had questions and was proactive in letting us know he would be out of town etc.  He made our check-in process easy as can be, and graciously let us check out very late because we had a late night flight, which was so appreciated.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment itself is large/clean, the amenities were great (full size bath products, plenty of towels etc.), a washer/dryer, wonderful bathtub (whirlpool).  The bed is comfortable too! The apartment was close to some great places and seemed to be no more than 15 minutes from anything else you\\'d want to see in Seattle.  Would definitely come back.  Fresh flowers throughout and homemade baked goods upon our arrival made us feel welcome!  This was a great spot, just as advertised.  We love the Ballard and Fremont neighborhoods, so this was the perfect place to stay to be near our favorite stuff.  The neighborhood was great for walking.  The location felt very safe and secure and the family was friendly while allowing us our privacy.  We never had trouble finding parking near the house.  We would definitely go back! The apartment has all the comforts of home, and a fabulous location. Mike and Jean Louise are very warm and welcoming, and their son and dog are absolutely precious.  Super yummy baked goods were provided at check in!  I would definitely recommend staying here during your time in Seattle!  Our stay was great. Mike and jean Louise were very welcoming and gratious. The apartment had everything We needed and more .The muffins were also a nice touch and very delicious. We would definitely book again. Cathy & Lou Mike and Jean Louise were fantastic hosts. Check in and check out process was easy. They both were always accessible and prompt with communication before and during our stay. Extra special touches include home-baked muffins, a local bottle of wine, and lovely floral arrangements throughout the unit. \\r\\nThe space itself is just as pictured. The couch turns into a pullout sleeper with memory foam top mattress available to make it very comfortable. The bath tub has jets in it so you can soak after a long day exploring Seattle. \\r\\nThe location is super convenient. Need something to do? Mike and Jean Louise have prepared a guide book for you to plan your days out! We loved our stay here!  It was so close to everything we wanted to do!  Easy to drive and park or hop a bus!  We were greeted with everything for a delicious breakfast that first day and the wine was a lovely treat after we put our little one to bed!  We will definitely be staying here again! All of the reviews of this place, and these folks are spot on!\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything I wanted, and nothing I didn\\'t want.\\r\\n\\r\\nHospitality Perfected.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have already booked my next stay. What a warm and welcoming experience!\\r\\nWhat a treat to be greeted after a long cross country journey with a plate of home baked cookies and a bottle of wine!\\r\\nA cozy and clean home with everything I needed for my weeklong stay in Seattle\\r\\nThe hosts have thought of everything a traveler might need and they made my stay so easy\\r\\nI was in Seattle to help a ill relative and it was so great to come back to this \"Home away from Home\"\\r\\nI will definitely consider staying there again & highly recommend this cozy and comfortable apt.   What a wonderful home away from home!  Everything was just as described,  communication with our hosts (Michael and Jean-Louise) was ample and smooth. Such an adorable apartment and we felt so welcomed with the nice little special touches (bottle of wine, fresh cut flowers and homemade cookies). Thank you! Looking forward to staying here again in the future! My stay was above excellent. The location was close to everything I wanted to see in Seattle. The apartment looked spotless and even had cookies and wine waiting for us. I would recommend this place for anyone who wants to walk around and explore Seattle.  Very nice place, great neighborhood, very clean, no complain at all. We recommend this place   When we arrived at the air bnb we were surprised by the home made goodies and bottle of wine that the hosts left for us.  The place is adorable and the hosts were really nice! Loved the wine (even though we didn\\'t drink it, whoops) and cookies. It was great for a weekend but would work out well for a longer stay too. Although I never met Michael in person, he was responsive via messages and I felt I could get in touch with him if need be.  The apartment was large as described with some nice touches including muffins, a bottle of wine, and recommendations for walkable neighborhood spots. Much of the toiletries and soaps were available for use.  Since this is a basement apartment, there was noise from upstairs, but minimal.  The photos represent the apartment well, and it was clean, but could be updated a bit (ceiling tiles were noticeably old and carpet had some stains).  \\r\\nThe neighborhood was a mix of houses and businesses, and some abandoned lots. Being new in the city, not knowing much about it, and the progressive vibe the community gave off, I did not feel comfortable walking around by myself at night.  \\r\\nOverall the apartment met my needs, and I was able to see Seattle from a local\\'s perspective.  Thanks! Mike, Jean Louise e Cash foram acolhedores e receptivos. Mike sempre foi imediato em responder as nossas perguntas e muito prestativo. Chegamos em Seattle para estudar e ficamos na casa deles  enquanto procurávamos uma casa para alugar. Antes mesmo de vir, ele tentou nos ajudar nos colocando em contato com uma imobiliária. A casa é exatamente como está nas fotos, muito aconchegante e confortável, e ela estava especialmente decorada com flores e com uma linda árvore de Natal natural. Muito obrigada por tudo! Pelo vinho, pelos deliciosos biscoitos e pelo dia inesquecível de brincadeira que o Gabriel teve com Cash e suas amigas no quintal... Indicaremos com certeza para nossos amigos que vierem a Seattle!  Michael and Jean Louise made every effort to make our stay over the holidays a wonderful one.  The apartment was exactly as described, in a good location, with yummy homemade cookies and a great bottle of wine upon arrival.  Plus beautiful little flower arrangements all over the apartment.  Oh, and the bed is very comfy.  We were traveling with a toddler and converted the walk in closet into his \"room\" and it worked perfectly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would definitely stay again on a future trip! Highly recommended My family and I had so much enjoyable experience. They are great host and we would love to stay here more later. Such a wonderful place and great hosts. We felt like home which is so rare when you travel. The apartment was cozy, cute, clean and with so many wonderful amenities we really didn\\'t need anything more. It\\'s very conveniently located close to everything you\\'d want to do in Seattle...highly recommend it and will stay here again.   Great place. Just as it was listed, actually even better.  Lots of small touches that made the stay exceptional, whole bean coffee, kitchen supplies, comfy bed, soft linens.  A wonderful location between two fun neighborhoods-- great food, microbreweries (Mike even provided an updates list of those in walking distance) farmers market, unique shops. So much better than a hotel, loved the space to stretch and hang out.  The fresh flowers were a lovely touch! The listing description was 100% accurate! Michael left us a wonderful list of breweries in the area, an empty growler, and a very helpful booklet of restaurants and things to do around town. There was also a delicious bottle of Pinot Noir and cream cheese-filled chocolate muffins - yum! We were very please with our choice and would stay there again.\\r\\n\\r\\n Michael\\'s place was the perfect place to stay. Not only was it clean, quiet and comfortable, but the location can\\'t be beat. The hospitality was off the chart with fresh flowers in the bedroom, freshly baked cookies, and a guide to local breweries in the area sitting on the kitchen table. I\\'d highly recommend staying here. My (long-term) stay at Jean Louise\\'s and Micheal\\'s place has been a consistently great experience. They were helpful whenever I needed anything and always made me feel welcome. The apartment itself was very comfortable and conveniently located, highly recommended! We had a wonderful stay with Michael at his apartment. First of all the location is killer. We are coffee lovers and slate coffee is a handful of blocks away. You are right between ballard and fremont so you\\'ve got lots of amazing bars, restaurants and retail within 5-10 minutes drive. The street was quiet. The place is big as described. Full kitchen and well appointed space. Who doesn\\'t love to be greeted by fresh baked chocolate chip cookies!!!! Such a sweet and thoughtful touch. MIchael  was an extremely knowledgeable and friendly host. Warm genuine welcome for us. It\\'s always nice to be greeted that way. You will not hear these guys at night but if you sleep in you will most likely hear them in the morning as the review states. But it\\'s really just like having an apartment above you and hearing people walking. Did not bother us at all. The space is clean and tasteful. It gets plenty of light. Full tub shower - it was great. It was all very private and very welcoming. We would highly recommend staying here.  Both Michale and Jean Louise made everything possible to make us feel welcomed. They went above and beyond in their hospitality efforts.\\r\\nThe place was good choice for a family of 3 people. You\\'ll find everything you need in the kitchen and bathroom. We even had a chance to enjoy their lovely backyard.\\r\\nThe communication with Mike was awesome - very quick and efficient.   We found this apartment to be just as was pictured. Very comfortable, quiet and clean.  We were greeted with a bottle of wine and cookies and made ourselves right at home.  The neighborhood was great. Lots of fun places to eat.  Easy access to public transportation (with easy instructions on finding routes left by our host.)  If we find ourselves headed back to Seattle we would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to you family and friends. Michael and Jean were fantastic hosts. They made us feel welcomed and at home. The apartment is better than pictures and in a very nice neighborhood. I would definitely recommend them to anyone and would go back there next time I visit Seattle.  Great apt - in Seattle\\'s heatwave it was lovely to come home to the cool accommodation. Street parking was good. Convenient to everything - such as shops, restaurants and breweries and a bus stop downtown at the end of the street.  The apt was kitted out with everything you could possibly need and Michael was very responsive from the beginning of our enquiries.  Absolutely fit my criteria of clean, comfortable and convenient.  Thanks for the welcoming wine, cookies and flowers.  We Had a wonderful Time in Seattle at Michael\\' s Place. The Apartment was spacious and well eqipped. The Location and the neighbourhood Ballard is Great. Getting dowtown by Bus is very easy. Michael and his family are very friendly, Helpful and easy-going.  A+++++\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was 3 of us. Here are our collective thoughts. So its like 2 reviews in 1…\\r\\n\\r\\nF - Great host, waiting for us by the door, he gave us a tour of the basement. Explain everything, left us some local amazing ice-cream in the freezer, a list of local restaurants and breweries around. The master bedroom is dark in the mornings so, if light bothers you in the morning this is perfect. Your own washer and drier is handy, everything is super clean. Super quiet house, no noise from the owners upstairs, the street, planes… Perfect place to rest. Quiet, comfortable & chilly. They have a frosted window on the bathroom, some soft discreet light trimming around the house entrance, to make it easier if you are coming late or leaving early. Nice open kitchen, you can tell they spend money to make this comfortable for guest and is not just a basement… Some board games and Netflix available as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nM - Michael, greeted us upon arrival to give us the tour. He was even gracious enough to surprise us with a locally made Blueberry Ice Cream, that was out of this world. This lovely basement apartment was actually larger than we anticipated. They pretty much thought of everything one might need while away...and they made it available to you. This place was very centrally located to the areas one would come to Seattle to visit.  We had a great time. The apartment is downstairs in a leafy and lovely residential neighborhood and about a 10-15 min. Walk to Ballard or Fremont, plus an easy bus ride into downtown. We really enjoyed the location, and Mike and Jean Louise were very friendly and helpful when we had any questions. Very comfortable and spotlessly clean place. My husband and I loved our 2 night stay in Michael and Jean Louise\\'s home in the Ballard/Fremont neighborhood.  Their place has everything you need to make you feel right at home! We absolutely loved checking out the local area- many amazing local restaurants and breweries.  Very accessible to nearby city attractions. Thanks you two for such a comfortable stay!! Michael and the family were wonderful hosts and I would absolutely recommend their place to anyone. They were very accommodating, as we had a 3.5 year old and a 1 year old travelling with us. They were so kind enough to even provide a pack and play crib and a baby gate for the stairway :) As for the place itself, it was very clean and well kept. All the common amenities you would have at your own home (kitchen, refrigerator, clean bathroom, etc) would be available to you. That is especially a huge plus if you if are travelling with kids or you simply wanted to stay and eat in.  Their place is in a wonderful community within Ballard, as there are many great breweries within walking distance (No need to Taxi or Uber!) , great places to eat around the area and you are only a very short drive to get to Downtown Seattle. The bus line #28 is literally a two minute walk away if you wanted public transportation to get directly to and from Safeco Field or Century Link Park if you are catching a Mariners game, Seahawks game or any event there. This bus line also gets you to Downtown.  We had a blast and you can bet that on our next trip to Seattle, we plan on reaching out again!! This place is exactly as described, and the location is hard to beat! It is close to several local breweries, and my favourite espresso bar in the region. Our hosts were very gracious and accommodating as well. If I come back to Seattle, I will definitely book this space again.  This was our first Airbnb experience, and everything went perfect. Although we didn’t get to meet Michael, Jean Louise and the family, (Hey, we were on Vacation and there’s so much to do in Seattle!) the place was just as described, and Michael was extremely helpful each time we did speak. We arrived to freshly baked cookies, a bottle of wine, and an empty growler to use, which we thought was a fantastic idea! Though we were too busy to make use of the full kitchen, it was complete with coffee and pretty much everything one might need to make homemade meals. The bedroom had a large closet for hanging up clothes, as well as an iron for those tough wrinkles. The bed was very comfy and relaxing, and as a huge bonus, we were able to make use of the Jacuzzi tub after a full day hiking Mt. Rainier! We took the bus (Route 28 being so close and convenient) or Lyft while we stayed, and the location was easily accessible no matter where we needed to go. All in all, we don’t have anything negative about our visit, and when we return, (there’s still so much to do in Seattle!) we would definitely stay here again! Michael and Jean Louise\\'s flat is spacious, clean and provides everything one needs to even spend a prolonged time there. The interior is nicely arranged, pictures, flowers and lots of other items make the flat feel cozy. We felt welcome right from the start and truly enjoyed our stay. I arrived very late; all the lights were on; very welcoming.  Warm cookies are a delight. Neighborhood is quiet. Very nice place. It has everything you could want. Couldn\\'t have been happier.  My mom and I had a great time at Michaels place! The hosts were welcoming and friendly, and left homey touches throughout the space. They also have a handy binder with information about the area and tips about the space. It\\'s obvious they put effort into to creating a warm environment for guests. The space is clean, attractive and comfortable and was perfect for our stay. I would highly recommend this place to others! Michael and Jean Louise\\'s apartment is great! It\\'s warm and inviting. When we arrived, there were fresh cookies in the fridge and a bottle of wine waiting for us. Even though there were 3 of us staying there, it was spacious and comfortable. There is a private entrance to the apartment which made it feel like our own. We did manage to meet Jean Louise and their friendly dog Guinness one day and they were both a pleasure to talk to. The location was great for us, very centrally located to everywhere we went.\\r\\nWonderful stay, we would recommend it to anyone looking for an AirBnb in Seattle. Very comfortable, little basement apartment with all the amenities you could want. Mike and Jean Louise were very friendly and welcoming, but respected our privacy.  Felt so good to be back in our old neighborhood and within walking distance of all Ballard has to offer. Our stay was incredible at Michael\\'s house. We especially enjoyed the wine, homemade cookies, and coffee (Seattle really knows their coffee). \\n\\nIt was very quiet and peaceful, we would recommend to anyone! Michael\\'s place was exactly as described, very clean and with all of the comforts of home. Fresh organic cookie dough, wine, and a log in the fireplace awaited us. \\nMichael was very accommodating with our late arrival time and early departure. This space was exactly as listed. The pictures absolutely do it justice...plus it has a whir pool bath! Very cozy, homey and soundproof. In a beautiful part of Seattle between the neighborhoods of Ballard and Fremont, easy access to everything. Wifi excellent, tv excellent, bed super-soft and warm colors all around. Michael met us, gave us a bottle of wine and there were three organic chocolate chip cookie dough patties waiting in the fridge. Really...what a great stay! Michael is a accomodating host.  The apartment was clean, as described, with room enough for the three of us.  Thoughtful touches included coffee beans w/grinder, cookies dough in the fridge - ready to be baked, a jacuzzi, and a extra foam pad for the living room futon.  Our host was very responsive on any questions.    Michael\\'s place\\'s located in a cute/quite neighborhood. The apartment is very clean and thoughtfully decorated. Really enjoyed the jacuzzi tub and the fire place. Michael was very good with commutation and we came there to some delicious homemade cookies. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone.  gonna miss the room in Seattle, which is nice and comfortable. Mike is the best host. WOW!!!\\r\\nNot only is it an amazing little quest house. Charlotte and Larry are perfect hosts. If you pay $150 per night you still got a deal. Best stay in Seattle!!!\\r\\nThanks guys we loved it and have never been so comfy... Charlotte and Larry\\'s guest house was fantastic.  We stayed with our three-year old son and had a wonderful, relaxing stay.  Not only was the house comfortable and stocked with everything we needed, they went above and beyond, providing us a stroller for our son, and toys and books.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location was perfect: a quiet residential neighborhood only 20 minutes walk from downtown Ballard, with easy car access to Downtown Seattle, and area parks.  If you need a friendly, convenient place to stay in Seattle, this is the perfect place. I loved staying at Charlotte and Larry\\'s garden guest house. Their  is their house is centrally located in Ballard, which is super fun, their backyard is beautiful, and I felt very comfortable and at home- particularly safe with Kaylee diligently watching the house, too! Thank you so much for your hospitality!  I can\\'t say enough great things about Charlotte and Larry\\'s guesthouse.  They are located in a great, quiet and cool neighborhood that is within walking distance of coffee shops, restaurants and bars.  The guesthouse is in a beautiful garden with several different sitting areas.  The guesthouse itself is compact, but comfy and has everything you need (including a nicely stocked kitchen with breakfast items).  Charlotte was out of town the days we were there, but Larry was warm, inviting and easy going.  He gave us some great tips of good things to do around town and fun places to eat.  Would 100% stay here again next time we are in Seattle. Charlotte & Larry\\'s Guest Cottage is comfortably nestled in the back of their lovely garden.  It is both private and tranquil, whilst simultaneously being located in the convenient and central neighborhood of Ballard in Seattle. While our interaction with them was limited, they greeted us with kindness and were attentive to our needs during the time of our stay.  The great care that they took in the provisions that were provided really spoke volumes about their concerns for our comfort. The cottage interior was peppered with very appealing and organic art that was both attractive and stimulating, yet relaxing and neutral.  Street parking was ample and the neighbors that we encountered were friendly.  Overall, our experience was a pleasant one and we would highly recommend this quaint cottage for a short stay. Had a great time at  Charlotte and Larry\\'s.   They were helpful when I needed it and let me amuse myself when I wanted.  The cottage was great with a hip Asian decor and lots of extra little touches.  Charlotte was excellent at encouraging me to take off on my bike availing myself of the close proximity to the designated bike routes.    I have no complaints and would happily rent this space the next time I\\'m in Seattle. Thank you! We loved staying here.  Charlotte and Larry we very welcoming and answered our questions about the area, brought us each a glass of wine, helped us with navigation and site seeing, and the Garden Guest House was totally comfortable, arty, and quiet, in a great, quaint, walkable neighborhood. We would stay there again! My wife and I stayed at the garden guest house and couldn\\'t have had a better time. It was tucked away on a quiet street, and felt very private the entire time of our stay. The house is only a couple blocks from some pubs and eateries. We also walked to downtown Ballard a couple of times as it was only a 15 minute walk. \\r\\n\\r\\nLarry and Charlotte made us feel very welcome from the instant we met them. The room was clean and was filled with almost every amenity. They even had a chocolate bar, yogurt and granola, and orange juice for our stay! The outside patio with chairs and tables make for a wonderful breakfast spot!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was our first Airbnb stay and we will definitely use it way more thanks to our great stay with Larry and Charlotte! Charlotte and Larry were very welcoming.  The guest house was as described, lovely, funky, artsy.  Its a short drive to Ballard, I always found parking.  Every thing I needed was provided, oj, coffee half n half, there were lots of teas, spices, dry food, granola, yogurt.  I plan to stay there next time I am in Seattle. This is a very special space that Larry and Charlotte have offered. Aside from all of the little personal touches, such as finding coffee, half and half, granola, organic dark chocolate bar, etc. already stocked, as well as the helpful and welcoming atmosphere, their little garden guest house was like a little peaceful sanctuary with access to downtown Seattle within a half hour or less, and within walking distance of the zoo and Green Lake. We had a wonderful time at the guest house. It was clean, cozy and had everything we needed. The gardens were beautiful and location was great. Larry and Charlotte were quick to respond and able to accomodate our (very) late arrival. Will definitly stay here again when we are back in Seattle. Charlotte and Larry provided us with a wonderful experience in Seattle. They were very welcoming, and their guest cottage is absolutely lovely. Would overwhelmingly recommend to anyone visting the Seattle area.  The Garden Guest House was a wonderful place to stay and we would recommend it to anyone.  The accommodations were very comfortable and very clean.  The location was fabulous and close to public transportation.  We had a great time and will stay here again when we visit Seattle in the future.  Thank you Charlotte and Larry for making us feel welcome! A beautiful hideaway! Charlotte and Larry made us feel super-welcome. Kitchenette came stocked, and the furnishings and garden setting are beautiful. Great experience! Lovely home and welcoming hosts. Charlotte and Larry gave some helpful trip advice. Short walk to bus line.  This cottage is a perfect little gem.  Very quiet, peaceful garden setting (extremely quiet at night - I slept very well).  The space is cozy and comfortable, and would be suited for 1-2 people. It was well appointed and stocked with essentials like coffee, juice, cereal, milk...  I only met Charlotte, who was very welcoming and friendly, in person, and she and Larry were very responsive and accomodating in both setting up my stay stay at the last minute and extending it for a couple of days.  I had a very nice stay and would recommend the place to anyone. Charlotte & Larry are excellent hosts & the garden guesthouse is perfect - a true getaway in the heart of Ballard - all around - above & beyond! Highly recommended! Charlotte and Larry were welcoming and helpful. The garden studio was lovely, clean, comfortable, and I felt so at home there! I would gladly come back and stay again. The neighborhood is safe and there are a couple of good restaurants within an easy walk.  Great cottage wit everything I could have asked for during my trip. Best experience I have had using Airbnb to date!  Charlotte and Larry have set up a very welcoming, clean, and beautiful detached farm cottage within a very beautiful and peaceful garden at their home.  The hosts took great care from a hospitality standpoint - the little things - great toiletries to use, supplied high quality coffee, milk, and yogurt, as well as a variety of teas.  The interior of the space is very comfortable and clean and well decorated - very cozy.  The neighborhood is close and convenient to everything.  I am excited to stay here again!     Charlotte and Larry\\'s cottage was great!  Very cozy with an abundance of bathroom products and food/snacks. The bed was comfortable and the back yard and neighborhood were peaceful and quiet. We would definitely stay there again! It was a lovely place to stay.  Very quiet and very sweet.  Everything was easily accessible and very peaceful. Charlotte and Larry were fantastic hosts.  They made my mom and I feel extremely welcome and comfortable.   We very much appreciate their generosity. \\r\\n\\r\\nTheir cottage and garden is gorgeous.  It\\'s completely self-sufficient, with it\\'s own kitchen set up, so you can come and go as you please.  East walking distance to shops, cafes, and restaurants in Ballard, a lovely part of Seattle with a rich fishing history.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had an excellent thanksgiving visit and hope to stay here again in the future.  Charlotte & Larry have gone out of their way to provide a splendid retreat in their garden guest house.  They made us feel very welcome, and we appreciated the care and detail that they have put into this beautiful cottage.  Charlotte and larry\\'s place is great, great ballard location, sweet and cozy. It was perfect for my wife and I to visit our son nearby. Great space in a great ballard/fremont location. Charlotte and larry were great host and made us feel welcome, even the nyr bubbly. The Garden Guest House is on a quiet residential street within walking distance of restaurants, shops, and, in fact all of downtown Ballard.  When I arrived at Charlotte and Larry\\'s Garden Guest House, I was greeted warmly by Larry and was shown around.   The Guest House is in the midst of the backyard of the main house, and is done up with lights and seeing areas so that it looked like a fairyland even in the midst of a Seattle winter.  Inside the Guest House the decor is artsy with plenty of space for 1 or 2 people.  The hosts have provided so many amenities:  hair dryer, a tiny kitchen area, even a flashlight.  It was very quiet there and I felt comfortable from the moment I walked in.   To other potential guests: I stayed here for a week and it was a perfect  little hideaway for my trip to Ballard. It\\'s just as charming as it looks in the photos. Clean towels, a comfy bed, a well stocked bathroom, kitchenette with breakfast snacks and cookware. Even in late January, the heaters are enough to stay comfortable. Some other highlights:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Welcome note and a Theo chocolate bar. Which I later learned is local to Ballard on the same block as my company\\'s Seattle office.\\r\\n- Very little street noise at night. It\\'s a few blocks from a main street and places to eat. But it\\'s far enough away from the bustle that you can get a great night sleep, no problem.\\r\\n- Parking was easy. All 7 days there was a spot right in front of the house.\\r\\n- Guide book. So, they have put together this extensive binder that\\'s full of maps, schedules, and personal recommendations for where to go and what to do in Seattle. It was really thoughtfully done.\\r\\n- Lockable safe. I didn\\'t have need for it, but it\\'s another extra step they have taken for their guests.\\r\\n- Fresh banana muffins! Charlotte left them hanging on the front door for me on my second morning there along with a note. So sweet!\\r\\n\\r\\nI met Charlotte & Larry the evening I checked in, but after that, they were out of sight. They seem super cool. Thank you Charlotte & Larry!  Charlotte and Larry were great hosts. The little cottage was just how it is described. I stayed there for nine days and it was perfect. I was able to relax, explore and do some work. They left a book with all the bus routes and maps of all the neighborhoods for me which was unbelievably helpful since it was my first time in Seattle. They checked on me every once in a while but let me have my privacy as well. \\n\\nI will definitely stay here again when I\\'m back in Seattle.  We loved the Garden Guest House! It was in a perfect location - we literally didn\\'t need our car at all for one entire day over our weekend stay. The place was very nicely decorated and very comfortable. We\\'d definitely stay there again!  Newly rehabbed guest cottage that is outfitted nicely, and very clean.  The kitchen is stocked with the finest goodies. There is a collection of interesting books. Eye-level screens divide the main space of the cottage into living, kitchen and bed areas.  The path from the street leads you past the hosts\\' house, through a lovely garden, a sitting area, then to the cottage\\'s door. Larry and Charlotte are truly thoughtful people and perfect airbnb hosts. Charlotte and Larry were very welcoming. The studio was filled with art and everything you could possibly need. Charlotte gave us a list of recommendations after we expressed our interest in museums and art galleries. She also saved us time and frustration in regards to taking our car on the Bainbridge ferry on a weekend. We saw Seattle from an insider\\'s view. She was also helpful with bus routes, restaurants and unusual shops. Charlotte also recommended a sidetrip when we mentioned our drive up to Bellingham.  Ballard is a very happening place, and the backyard was a lovely place to retreat to after seeing the sights.  One of our best AirBnB experiences! Larry & Charlotte made us feel very welcome from the moment we arrived. Their backyard studio was extremely comfortable and had everything we needed. They made sure we knew they were available if we needed anything and they provided plenty of great information about the area as well as the Seattle area as a whole. The location of Larry & Charlotte\\'s place was great, too. The shops and restaurants of Ballard are in easy walking distance and downtown Seattle is only a few minutes drive over the Ballard Bridge. We loved our stay and would recommend this property to anyone looking for a fun, cozy place to stay in the Seattle area. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe loved Kaylee, too! Very comfortable studio fully equipped in Ballard. A bit far from Downtown but easy to park if you have a car. Charlotte and Larry are really nice hosts, welcoming us with orange juice, water and milk in the fridge and everything to make coffee or tea. Nice experience.  Absolutely loved staying here! Charlotte and Larry had tons of information and ideas laid out in the space to help us decide the best things to do when in Seattle. Larry was home when we got there so he helped us feel very comfortable and welcome when arriving. Great location, in a quiet neighborhood so easy sleeping but walkable to lots of fun restaurants and cafes. Awesome and beautiful space. Would definitely recommend it!! This was a great stay and the little space was just what I was looking for.  The outdoor area is quiet and and the studio is cozy.  Charlotte and Larry are quite helpful indeed.  You can walk to great coffee food and bars from here as well. Good spot. This listing is spot on.  The studio in the hosts lovely oasis/garden backyard is very comfortable, and has everything needed for a great, relaxing trip.  Kitchen essentials were provided, and important day-starter items like delicious coffee, cereal, yogurt, milk, juice.  The bathroom was modern and clean, stocked with neat local products.  The towels were huge and fluffy.  We enjoyed having morning coffee right outside the door in the garden.  We loved exploring the Ballard neighborhoods and attractions, like the Nordic Heritage museum, the locks, and many of the Ballard breweries. The location is convenient with quick and easy access to downtown Seattle via the Ballard bridge with our rental car. Public transit was available.  There is a grocery nearby, and it was a good neighborhood for jogging. The hosts were friendly and helpful, with a large book in the studio of local attractions and other helpful information.   Charlotte, Larry & Kaylee made us feel very welcome in their cozy cottage, which was a perfect launch point for our daily excursions into the city,  Mt. Rainer and the north for some Whale watching. The cottage is conveniently located in the Ballard neighborhood, surrounded by great eateries, breweries, and nightlife! We would recommend their place to anyone planning a trip to the Seattle area.  The comfortable cottage has a very thoughtful layout, and is equipped with an efficient kitchen - perfect for that morning cup of coffee and tea. Thank you for making us feel at home during our stay in Seattle! Roomy and beautiful space in a private area. The garden was very peaceful and beautiful. Artistically decorated and arranged! Charlotte & Larry were wonderful hosts and left us some breakfast food in the kitchen.   Charlotte and Larry made us feel very welcome.  Charlotte contacted me several times prior to our stay with full details.  We had our dog Abbey with us, and even though pets are not normally accepted, an exception was made.  I appreciated this very much.  Charlotte provided a cover for the couch so Abbey would be able to sit on it.  We were only asked that she not be on the bed which was not a problem as we had her bed with us.  The cottage was just as described...cute, cozy, clean and welcoming.  Breakfast items such as yogurt, cereal, milk, OJ, coffee (Starbucks of course) and a delicious chocolate bar were provided.  Toiletry items, extra towels, sheets, etc. were also provided.  There was no television, but there was a combo CD player/Radio with decent speakers and a nice selection of CD\\'s to choose from.  There was a binder of information on the Seattle area and information on many of the attractions in the area.  Our time was limited and unfortunately we did not have much time to spend at the cottage.  I would have loved to have enjoyed a glass of wine in the garden and linger among the beautiful flowers.  The lights were a nice touch too.  The inside of the cottage was decorated beautifully.  I noticed something new at every turn.  Even though it was small, it was fine for the 3 of us (my husband, my daughter & myself). My daughter slept on the single pull out couch and felt it was fine.  The bed was extremely comfy.  The first night we were able to park in the driveway as Charlotte & Larry were out of town.  However on the 2nd night we had to find street parking.  With a full sized pick-up truck, it was a bit of a challenge.  We did not have time to walk around Ballard, however we drove to and had a great time at The Leary traveler, an extremely dog-friendly pub and grill.  My husband left his hat behind and Charlotte graciously offered to mail it back to us.  I would happily stay at Charlotte and Larry\\'s Garden Guest House again.   Larry accommodate my arrival time and he and Charlotte made sure I felt comfortable and safe during my 2-day stay. Gone most of the day, I enjoyed their nice selection of CDs and books for relaxing evenings. Excellent neighborhood for walking with Ballard Market close by. we stayed at charlotte and larrys\\' place last Monday and Tuesday. their place was exactly as described and they were warm and welcoming. communication was excellent and vibe was laid back. we would stay with them again if we come back to seattle Larry and Charlotte were very nice and welcoming.  The cottage was cozy and had everything you need. The yard was beautiful.    Would definitely recommend staying here! Charlotte and Larry\\'s hafh (home away from home) was truly lovely. A comfortable, spacious, anchor for my visit to Seattle. Everything I could have wished for was there, from breakfast choices to music and wheat bags to bathroom necessities. Thanks for the knowledgeable personal touch.  What can I say to describe how perfect our stay was. We were greeting by Larry who showed us everything and then met Charlotte who went over all the information we needed to tour the city of Seattle. We loved the Guest House, the neighborhood, Ballard and Seattle too!!! Thank you  What a lovely welcome we had to the garden guest house!  Charlotte and Larry left easy instructions on how to access the house if they weren\\'t available, and as soon as they arrived home they came to greet us with friendly smiles and local advice.  The best part, for me, there was a welcome chocolate bar.. the perfect thing to take the edge off my hunger when we arrived!  There was also a fridge stocked with juice, creamer, etc for breakfast.. cereals.. coffee and tea.. etc.  The bathroom had a great selection of lotions and sweet smelling toiletries.  The garden is more lovely than the pictures can show!  All in all, a delightful experience! Great little house and location.  Charlotte and Larry are very kind.  They provided lots of treats as well as toiletries, and information about Seattle.  There is a good working internet connection.  The place is cozy and decorated beautifully. And there is a good library with a lot of my personal favorites.  Charlotte and Larry were both really easy and warm to communicate with. I was up visiting a friend who had a child in the hospital so having a quiet and cozy place to land was important to me. The space had everything I needed. There were thoughtful touches throughout and the location was great too. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle. They were phenomenal! Beautiful private space with yard and an above and beyond amount of amenities / provided extras! I was searching for a place last minute for my three piece band and I after our sleeping arrangements fell through. Varun was more than willing to host us on such short notice, Incredibly kind and easy going. Very clean home ! Overall excellent experience Very nice apartment, clean and quite. Great space in a great part of the city. Only stayed two nights, but would have been comfortable here for a long stay. The space has everything you need, gets lots of great light and is very quiet.  Apartment was great and just as described.  Host was very welcoming upon our check-in and then left us to explore.  The extra touches left in the apartment were a plus (pillows, blankets and chocolates). The neighborhood eateries are wonderful and the trip to downtown Seattle a quick ride away.   This apartment was wonderful. It\\'s in a quiet, nice neighborhood and is well-equipped with everything we needed. Thanks for the hospitality, Lisa! Lisa was a wonderful host. Check in was easy, check out was smooth.  We had a wonderful stay her private apartment.  Perfectly located for easy access to Fremont and Ballard, we really enjoyed our trip to Seattle. The apartment was great and exactly as described. Great neighborhood!  Nice,  clean, safe neighborhood,  and affordable for a short visit.  Basement apartment below Lisa\\'s house with its own entrance and spacious. Very short commute to center city. Cute, clean apartment! It looked exactly like the photos.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends. Lisa was a lovely host. Traffic delayed our arrival, and she was more than accommodating.  We were house-hunting in Seattle, and her place was a perfect basecamp for running around the city.  This private apartment was perfect for my small family.  We were on a family vacation and needed something close to the city but quite enough to relax after our long days of exploring.  Lisa was welcoming and then left us to our privacy.  Check in and out where smooth and we would definitely would stay again. The apartment is on a quiet street near a couple of very interesting neighbourhoods, and is also near bus lines going into downtown Seattle.  My friends and I found it to be a good home base for a short trip. Located in a quiet residential neighborhood with ample parking in the street. Apartment was very clean, open, and well lighted. It was bright and pleasant and very comfortable. Sleeping was very comfortable. Fresh nice towels and linen were (website hidden) area was nicely appointed if you wanted to prepare meals. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe host was responsive to questions by email and text. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe enjoyed our stay and would stay here again if we are in the area.  The apartment was fantastic, exactly as described. A much larger space than I was expecting. With a comfy r table bed and nice living room. Lisa was extremely nice and helpful. Loved the neighborhood. Can\\'t uldnt recommend this highly enough. Very well represented by photos and descriptions. Quiet neighborhood & convenient location. Clean & well kept despite basement feeling entrance. Lisa\\'s apartment worked out perfectly for me on a trip to Seattle for work. I was attending a conference at the Convention Center downtown and, while Lisa\\'s apartment is not within easy walking distance, there are several buses that can get to within a few blocks of the Convention Center or the apartment easily and efficiently. The apartment and neighborhood are quiet and homey after a busy day downtown.\\n\\nThere are a number of good places to eat near the apartment as well. The apartment has a full kitchen, but I only used the coffeemaker to brew up some excellent coffee from Seattle Coffee Works near Pike Place market. Just a note, the one thing fairly standard thing I did not see in the kitchen was a microwave oven.\\n\\nWifi worked well and my cell phone reception was good, so it is easy to communicate while staying at the apartment. Lisa and I communicated mostly by text, but she did show me around the apartment when I arrived. She seems to be pretty available upstairs in the main house, if needed.\\n\\nAll in all, I thought this apartment was a very good value and I would definitely stay here again on another trip to Seattle. A great location from which to explore greater Seattle. This basement unit provided us with everything that we needed, with notable privacy and cleanliness. Lisa was very accommodating and very responsive throughout the process. Her place is fantastic and the pictures are very accurate. The place has everything anyone would need! The neighborhood is extremely quiet and just minutes from downtown. The ADU was warm, inviting and accessed pretty easily by going through Lisa\\'s yard.\\r\\n\\r\\nLisa is responsive and was kind enough to text me a few hours before our arrival notifying us that she\\'s running a bit late. It\\'s the little things that count.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unit was spotless and if you\\'re going through Seattle, I\\'d recommend the apartment again. Lisa was a great host and responded quickly to any questions I had. The space is in a great location, easy to walk to both Ballard and Fremont. The apartment is very well decorated, has lots of light and comfortable to relax in. Great place to stay. The apartment had everything we needed, was clean and comfortable, homely and private. We also appreciated flexibility around arrival time. Stayed a weekend in Seattle for my boyfriend\\'s birthday and felt right at home here after spending all day exploring the city. Extremely clean and comfortable. She even had coffee in our kitchen for us! So convenient from downtown as well. Couldn\\'t have asked for a better stay for our first time in Seattle. Our experience staying at Lisa\\'s house was great.  Our train to Seattle was delayed by 4 hours which put us in town at 1AM.  Lisa gave clear instructions how to access the unit and get settled in.  There was an issue with accessing Wi-Fi which Lisa addressed promptly.   Lisa was very helpful, and went above and beyond to help us have a good stay. (Including picking up flowers for our stay!) The location was great, with bus stops and shops within walking distance. \\n\\nThe room itself was very clean and attractively furnished. However, the main bed sagged a bit in the middle, and the sofa made a great place to sit, but it was a bit too hard and small when converted to a second bed. Overall we had a great experience, and it\\'s a good place to explore Fremont. Loved the funky neighborhood and Lisa made checking in and out easy.  Lisa\\'s place was very spacious, and in a perfect quiet neighborhood that was only a mile from the best of Ballard AND Freemont. Easily the best location possible, and super convenient if you rent a car to see some wilderness outside the city and need a place that\\'s friendly to park it. She was even great at quickly sending us some items we forgetfully left behind! A nice, clean and comfortable apartment in a good location. It\\'s on a quiet street with easy parking available. Also,  it is very easy to bike to locations in Fremont or Ballard from the apartment. Delightfully quiet neighborhood, this was exactly what I was looking for! Breweries within blocks, green lake and the zoo a few streets away, and an uber within 5 minutes to go downtown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place itself was quiet, secluded, and neat. I couldn\\'t have asked for a simpler stay, and Lisa was perfect in communicating everything I needed to know! Would definitely stay at again, and wished my time in Seattle was longer! Lisa\\'s place was awesome and the perfect place to crash after a day of exploring Seattle. Very chill neighborhood and parking was a breeze. Check in / out was super easy and the apartment was very clean and in tune with its description. Would definitely recommend staying here.  The listing matched the reality.  Nice, clean, cozy basement apartment in a quiet neighborhood.  Parking on the street was always available (which is important in Seattle).  We were close to major streets without having to be stuck in traffic.  It was just right for what we needed.  We even managed to prepare a Thanksgiving meal for our daughter in the kitchen.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn\\'t meet our host in person, but she was always available via text and responded to us right away.  Very nice! Wonderful location, kind and helpful owners, free on-street parking and cool retro décor. I highly recommend this apartment and enjoyed my stay.  Wonderful stay at Rob and Molly\\' house. Everything was super clean and well furnished. It was a lovely stay and we would recommend the place to anybody that is looking to spend a few days/weeks in Seattle. Stayed here while some work was being done at my place. Rob and Molly are super nice. The place is nice and clean. Quiet neighborhood with easy driving access to a lot of things. Excellent communication.  Super clean space to chill for a few days before we made our way into the wilderness of Olympic State Park.  Ballard is a cool town and we enjoyed the Sunday farmer\\'s market.  Though the downtown area is within walking distance, we found the hike in the cold and rain to be a bit arduous (weak Floridians!) so on the last day we rented a car.  Free parking outside.  Do yourself a favor and walk up the hill: on a clear day, the view is amazing!  Rob and Molly are super kind and courteous hosts.  Thanks for the coffee!! \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVery comfortable, clean and conveniently located. The home was well stocked. It was like a home away from home. Rob was a very accommodating and pleasant host. He was quite attentive and made sure any needs were promptly met. The location was ideal. Ballard is a great town to walk around in the big City of Seattle. In addition, the duplex was on a main bus route to downtown Seattle. I only wish we had more time to stay there. \\r\\nVery highly recommended.\\r\\nBob Peddicord, Ph.D.; Bangor & Sullivan, Maine\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n My family and I had a fantastic stay at Rob and Molly\\'s place.  We got the baby/toddler package, which was super convenient - no need to find a pack and play, lug a stroller cross-country or pack an extra suitcase for our son\\'s books and toys! The Ballard cottage was cozy, clean and conveniently located. The well-stocked kitchen, quiet bedroom, and a great radio made our stay comfortable and relaxing. Thanks for the kid-friendly restaurant rec - we had a great meal at The Phinney Market! My boyfriend and I stayed at Rob and Molly\\'s place in Ballard and had a very good stay. The house is very cute and clean and has a great location and is close proximity to shopping, restaurants and other neighborhoods. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'d recommend to anyone coming to Seattle and is looking to get a feel for what it be like to be a local!  We loved the location of Rob and Molly\\'s place.  In a residential area with easy parking, the apartment is centrally located between three great Seattle neighborhoods (Ballard, Freemont, and Phinney Ridge).  It\\'s also only ten minutes by car to downtown across the Ballard or 99 bridge.  We didn\\'t use public transportation, but there seemed to be bus stops less than a block away.  The apartment itself is simply furnished with a hip, thrift store style.  We were able to sleep four, with our teenage daughters using an inflatable mattress in the living room.  Check-out and check-in was simple.  Overall, a great experience and a good value for a traveling family.  Thanks Rob and Molly.  If we visit Seattle again, you\\'ll be our first choice for accommodations.  We really enjoyed our weekend at Rob & Molly\\'s cozy Ballard cottage! Great location, amenities & easy communication with our hosts. What a great stay in beautiful Seattle! The house was clean and perfect for my husband and myself. Just a short walk to downtown Ballard and goodwill! I would definitely stay again! Had an amazing time at Rob and Molly\\'s place. Ballard and Phinney are really great neighborhoods to hang out in, R& M\\'s place is super comfortable and well located. We were able to walk to lots of restaurants and shopping. The Ballard neighborhood in Seattle has pleasant, quiet streets, and it is reasonably accessible to major thoroughfares that connect to the rest of the city. If you want a discreetly managed place to stay, this may be your best bet.  It is a separate cottage down the street from the proprietors (Rob and Molly) who keep the premises neat and clean and provide the basics to make your own breakfast (i.e. coffee, a grinder, and a good French press). You may even find a locally brewed beer in the refrigerator. Rob and Molly are helpful with directions and such, if needed.  If not, they stay out of your way.  Their cottage was well suited to my needs, and I enjoyed my stay.  Loved it! Great retro decor. Really liked the old school radio. Friendly & helpful hosts. Easy Parking. Close to Ballard shops & restaurants. Ballard Market was just a few blocks away. Slate coffee and Veraci Pizza extremely close and fantastic. Tried to eat a slice of Veraci pizza each day - didn\\'t quite work out.  We stayed here during our move back to Seattle, and it was a great landing spot for North Seattle.  There is a downtown bus (#28) right out front that also takes you to downtown Fremont, or the #44 bus takes you to downtown Ballard or, in the other direction, Wallingford and the University District. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was nicely decorated and had enough amenities for our week-long stay.  Good wifi, a kettle, and a toaster are all we really need, but the house also has a washer/dryer, kitchen utensils for making a meal at home (but why would you when you\\'re so close to all the good things Ballard and Fremont have to offer?), and magazines and books for perusing.   We really enjoyed our stay in Ballard. It was a perfect neighborhood for our young family, very walkable, and close to public transportation. We found the house to be very charming and accommodating for our week stay. We used the air mattress provided, could not find it right away, and I called Rob with a really quick response and he was willing to come over to help if needed. Thanks for a wonderful place to call home for a week. Cheerful, clean space in a great location. We especially liked the cool books and retro decor. Very convenient to some of Seattle\\'s coolest neighborhoods (Fremont, Ballard, Wallingford, Green Lake and the U district). Highly recommend this place! Rob and Molly responded promptly to all of our communications. They gave suggestions for places to visit in Seattle and were available if we needed anything. (Thank you!)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duplex was exactly what we expected. It really looks like the photos and description! And it\\'s very eco friendly = seventh generation cleaning products. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is definitely a neighborhood. There was a bit more traffic on the street than we expected (less traffic at night) but don\\'t worry about it unless you are super sensitive to noise. There\\'s a great pizza place (Veraci Pizza) a couple of blocks from the apartment and many more restaurants and shops a couple of blocks in the other direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe ended up spending most of our time in downtown Seattle and near the Space Needle (EMP and Chihuly museums are amazing). The apartment was surprisingly close to the Space needle (10-15 min by car). I\\'m pretty sure there are buses that go downtown as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nThings we loved!\\r\\nthe closet space\\r\\nthe vintage decor, glassware, shower and kitchen tiles\\r\\nhow close it is to Seattle Space needle/downtown\\r\\nfree wifi\\r\\nfree beer\\r\\nparking in front of the apartment Rob and Molly have a wonderful place, even roomier than it looks in the photos. Highly recommended! Area was great, close to Trader Joe\\'s and the amazing Ballard area. Super close to the zoo too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bed wasn\\'t too comfortable, which was a bummer, and kind of loud when you turn in bed. We were very happy during our stay in Seattle. \\r\\nRob and Molly\\'s cottage is ideally located in a nice, quiet neighborhood; \\r\\nClose to downtown Ballard, with a great selection of restaurants and its fantastic farmer\\'s market.\\r\\nExcellent response time from Rob to all correspondence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Charming, clean, and cozy in a central location. Lovely experience, this home truly had \"vintage Ballard charm\". In a city that has grown tighter and tighter it was nice to have a landing spot with some elbow room and a sense of \"home\". We were able to park right in front every time. The space met  and exceeded all of our needs and expectations. We were very grateful for the washer and dryer downstairs. Everything we needed was there or accessible nearby. Our girls camped out in the living room on the queen size air bed and enjoyed watching the world go by out the tree shaded front window. The bedroom was quiet and the firm mattress was perfect for our road weary backs. If we ever get back out to Seattle, we would definitely stay here again.  We enjoyed our stay in your \"Vintage Ballard Charm\". Bright and clean. A perfect home away from home. Wonderful vacation. Very prompt response to any questions I had. The house was clean and super comfortable. We will definitely stay here on our next Seattle trip! A good stay. A few items were needed and they brought them right over.  The house was clean and cute. Everything worked well especially the kitchen. The location was great for walks and shopping. Ballard is fun. We had a great stay at this place! Everything was in place and clean when we arrived. Good location for getting to downtown and to other family events to the north.  We walked to a couple of local restaurants that were pretty tasty.  Nice neighborhood for walking.  The decorative touches were great!  Great little house, close-in location! Sweet hosts left coffee and beer for us! We enjoyed our stay at Molly and Rob\\'s place during our time in Seattle. They set us up with some beers in the fridge and great coffee beans from Caffe Vita which was an added bonus. One thing to note is that this place is a duplex and not a detached home. We didn\\'t realize this, but the neighbor was super quiet and it didn\\'t pose any problems. Just an FYI. The location in Ballard is great because it\\'s in one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle and within walking/biking distance to tons of great restaurants, bars, shops and coffee places.  The Vintage Ballard was an older home that completely served our purpose during a recent trip to Seattle. It ha a washer and dryer and a complete kitchen. We enjoyed our stay. It definitely had \\'vintage charm\\' with classic magazines, dishes, furniture etc. The neighborhood is great with lots of food and beer close by. Free parking also saved us a lot of money as Seattle parking can be expensive in certain areas.  Our guest got to the airport in just over 1 hour on one bus and one train. The coffee and beer left for us was also greatly enjoyed. We had a very pleasant time. The house is very charming and we felt at home right away. As a bonus, the bus stop to go downtown is close by. Rob and Molly were very responsive and friendly. We happened to arrive during one of Seattle\\'s few hot spells, and they even offered to track down an extra fan for us to make things more comfortable. As for the location and unit itself, the bed and pillows were a bit hard and the bed had a dent in the middle, and the street was a little busy (though with the windows closed traffic noise wasn\\'t much of an issue).  Cute place in an excellent location to get around the city. The coffee and beer are a nice added touch. Rob and Molly were very accomodating when we had to leave earlier than expected.  Besides the cozy bed with fluffy down duvet, lots of closet space and nice green products (we really appreciated), the bungalow was light, pleasant, simply and artfully decorated as pictured and described.  We noticed some extra goodies in the kitchen cabinets and ample cooking gear.  Loved the press coffee maker and fresh coffee beans with grinder, retro kitchenware and the supply of umbrellas!  We only wished we could have stayed longer. This was a perfect location for us with great access and easy street parking.  We most certainly recommend this unique place. My husband and I especially enjoyed Ballard historic area.  Stores and eateries were all conveniently nearby.  Thanks to you both for a lovely first time stay in Seattle.   What a wonderful home base in a new city!  We weren\\'t home more than 2hrs/day but that is no reflection of this place. We found it very familiar at the end of a day exploring nearby neighborhoods. We loved how it was so close to the bus stops that can take you to almost any part of Seattle. Ballard was a very charming neighborhood with a ton of great places to eat. We can\\'t wait to come back!\\n\\nThanks for being a part of the most memorable vacation ever! Rob and Molly were quick to respond and super accommodating, even letting me add a day to the reservation at the last minute. The house was the perfect, simple getaway:  easy to find, clean, comfortable, and gorgeous. It was a fantastic for our family (including a 7 and 4 year old). It looks like the pictures! The perfect place to spend misty mornings at the coffee table before heading out for a Seattle adventure.\\r\\nSo accommodating, there was even a hair dryer in the hall closet! \\r\\nThe neighborhood is adorable too, if you want to walk through rows of colorful houses, each with an adorable garden. Excellent coffee at Slate is a 5min walk away. \\r\\nReally enjoyed this place, would come back in a heartbeat! Cute, sunny, vintage home. I had picked up some coffee beans so was glad to have the grinder and French press to be able to make a good cup of coffee to enjoy on the side patio. It\\'s a large space, and it\\'s great to have the comforts of home while traveling! We stayed at Rob and Molly\\'s sweet Ballard cottage for 9 days in Sep.  It was perfect for us.  Our daughter lives nearby and it was good to be so close.  The cottage was very clean and we had all we needed for our stay.  The nice touches of coffee and beer were much appreciated as was the candy jar (which our granddaughters loved!).  The cottage was close to all the amenities and it was great to be able to walk to shops and restaurants.\\r\\nHope Rob and Molly will have us back on our next visit!! Rob and Molly did a tasteful job decorating the interior of this dwelling with a retro modern flair, fitting of Ballard. The custom head board and vintage stereo were nice additions. The house is open on 3 sides so there was plenty of light. The fenced side yard was a comfortable retreat to have a drink and soak in the outdoors. Parking was easy and Slate cafe and Brimmer and Heeltap were great places just a 5 minute walk away. Walking to the Farmer\\'s Market and Macefield music festival would have only taken 20 minutes, but we opted to drive with the little one. It was  a convenient home base for Golden Gardens and Carkeek Park as well. Overall a great place to stay in Ballard. We loved Rob and Molly´s place in Ballard! The place felt very spacious with a lot of beautiful light, and the back deck was perfect for having a morning coffee in the sun. We slept very well there! It´s very close to everything you need - just a few blocks away from the Ballard market and the bus station for D-line to Seattle downtown, and if you walk a few blocks further you´re at Ballard avenue with lots of restaurants and bars. Communication and check-in was really easy. A perfect place to explore both Ballard and Seattle - we hope to come back one day!\\r\\n\\r\\n We had a great time. The house was centrally located to everything. Very easy to get to other destinations. The only thing I missed was having a television to watch while trying to sleep. Other then that, great place. We had such a great stay at this lovely and cozy little home. The location was perfect for everything we wanted to do, and the place had everything we needed. Parking was always easy, and being able to do laundry was such a big help. We loved the layout, decor, and being able to listen to KEXP all day! Check in and check out were a snap, and Rob and Molly were very communicative with us beforehand - we didn\\'t end up having any issues at all that necessitated calling them while we were there, but I felt confident that we could have had we needed to. I was about 6 months pregnant while on this trip, and though we didn\\'t need it quite yet, I really liked that they had a baby gear package available. I think just knowing that was a big part of why we choose this place, and I\\'m so glad we did! Can\\'t wait to come back at some point with our little one! My time in Seattle/Ballard was spectacular and a lot of that had to do with Rob and Molly\\'s great house and hospitality! The place was cozy, comfortable and in a fantastic location. Rob and Molly were excellent communicators and very helpful hosts right from the beginning, while I was booking the space. I would definitely stay here again and will recommend this listing to friends visiting the area. \\r\\nThe location is perfect. It\\'s within walking distance to adorable pubs, pizza and coffee [less than 5 minute walk] and, if you\\'re an avid walker [which I am], it\\'s only a 20 minute walk to Ballard Ave and some of the best eating, drinking and shopping establishments in the city. The Seattle Locks park is a short drive away and a lovely spot....just perfect!  Listing was as described, very charming little place and a great home base for us while exploring Ballard and the rest of Seattle. The neighbourhood was quiet, safe and close to what we wanted to see in Seattle. Molly and Rob were exceptionally accommodating and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. The beer, wine and candy were a great touch! I would not hesitate to book this place again. Thanks! This was a great home-base for me and my dog! Spacious, and has everything you need to cook for yourself and feel right at home. Location was very close to downtown and Fremont. We got in late on a Friday from Portland, but the outside light was on and the radio was playing quietly when we arrived. Very welcoming. The place was tidy and there was ample space for the 4 of us to spread out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kitchen was stocked with pots & pans and we were all set to make a quick breakfast before heading out to explore for the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat access to the Zoo and Green Lake Park. Overall a great home base for exploring Seattle. Lovely accommodation and great location!  I really liked the vintage appeal as it made it feel more like home. Definitely plan on returning to Ballard during the warmer months. The host was very accommodating, everything was laid out just as they promised, and the place was great. Perfect location and size, super comfortable, just terrific. Perfect for a writer\\'s retreat, or any kind of decompressing. Would absolutely stay here again. Loved it.  The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting. The place was great and lived up to its description and reviews, we were very pleased with our stay and would love to be back there sometime.  Loved staying at Rob and Molly\\'s place. The location is great, parking is a breeze and the place is exactly as pictured. Very cozy and with any  amenity you might need during a stay. A lot of nice touches (beer in the fridge, coffee in the cabinets) that were welcome even if I didn\\'t get around to using them. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey\\'re also incredibly quick about getting back to you if you have any questions or concerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat property and great hosts. I was disappointed in the rental.  It had no television (my fault for not noticing this in the description) and the furniture was sparse and not very comfortable.  In short, it was not a nice place to relax... We only slept there.  Shower was not hot.  I would not rent again, and will be much more skeptical of AirBnB in the future. The location was perfect and the house was nice. Kitchen was easy to use and had plenty of appliances, just double check before you begin cooking to make sure you\\'re prepared. Plenty of towels and sheets to use. I had a great stay. Loved the location. Really close to green lake and places to eat. The house was just as I pictured it. I will definitely stay here again.  Great location and accurate description. Would definitely stay again if visiting the area. This was a great little spot in the heart of Ballard. It was just as pictured and described. I would definitely stay here again, except the bed was too firm for my needs.  Great neighborhood, neat place. We had a little trouble getting anything for the baby because Rob was out of town, but he was really helpful. The space works well for adults.  The vintage theme is consistent throughout, and we didn\\'t have any trouble with the furniture being uncomfortable as one reviewer had mentioned. It was much bigger than it seemed from the front, and though it was a duplex, we never heard the neighbors.   Everything was great and exactly as the description and pictures describe. The hosts are very communicative and helpful.  Wonderful space. Clean, quiet and very friendly. Would definitely stay here again. Loved the decor.  A true retro feel down to the books, radio & tootsie pops! Adorable little place and easy parking. Rob & Molly were very communicative and helpful. We enjoyed our cozy stay very much! Rob and Molly\\'s place was clean, cute and in a great location. I would definitely recommend staying here!  It was great. Most everything was perfect. Love the house - great decor and feel. Excellent location - near Veraci Pizza, Ballard Market, and much more. \\r\\n\\r\\nHaving local coffee and beer on hand is a nice touch.\\r\\n\\r\\nRob and Molly are always very quick to respond to any questions. We had a great time in Seattle. Rob and Molly\\'s place was the perfect fit for us. Awesome neighborhood, cute house and thoughtful hosts. \\nThe house has everything you could need for a stay in Seattle. It was clean, quiet and walkable to some great stuff. We walked to the zoo, the attached Green Lake Park and to dinner at Phinney Market (highly recommend especially if traveling with children). Rob and Molly also had baby items for those traveling with babies/kids. Molly brought over some toys and books for us as well, my kids really enjoyed that. \\nAll in all, it was an enjoyable time. I would certainly recommend Rob and Molly\\'s home. \\n Perfect size for 4 (college friends). We were visiting Seattle for a conference and spent most of our time away from the home exploring, but the home was exactly what we needed. Not too big, not too small, just right. The area is also great with a variety of food options. Thanks Rob and Molly :)  The house was clean and comfortable. Walking distance to all the shops and restaurant in Ballard. A great place to stay outside of the bustling downtown Seattle area.  We arrived to a very dirty house, all of the trash that was left from the previous renters was everywhere, dirty linens were on the floor the whole house is in disarray. We emailed the owners and Molly showed up saying she was going to clean the house while we walked around town, we gave her the benefit of the doubt and while she was explaining things to do and places to go we witnessed her washing the dishes with hand soap and her bare hands because there was no sponge, it was disgusting, plus we came back and nothing was cleaned. We had to spend the whole next day cleaning the entire house so that we felt comfortable,not to mention we bought our own cleaning supplies because there was none in the house. The only good thing about the whole experience was the location and the neighbor. I also miss placed an item and I emailed the owners in which they never responded not even to tell me they didn\\'t find anything so I would never recommend this place to anybody! The check-in was very easy, and the house was, as advertised, legitimately vintage - in a way that took me back to childhood spent in elder relative\\'s houses - was a lot of fun to see how they preserved that era simply and faithfully. \\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed the short walk from the house to Brimmer and Heeltap, an amazing restaurant / bar, and to the coffee shop across the street from there (Slate). In the morning, Woodland Park isn\\'t too far away if you\\'re up for a beautiful jog through a well-kept neighborhood with scenic views of seattle. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe street the house is on is a busier one, and the house seems to be part of a duplex, but we heard no noise during our stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nRob and Molly were great hosts, leaving the house with magazines and brochures and maps of the area, and even kind enough to offer to send an item I\\'d left behind in the house. Very great time here and highly recommended for those who wish to be in the Ballard neighborhood. What can I say? Your place was perfect for my trip! It was so quiet and peaceful. I would (and will) recommend it to others who are going to Seattle. I love the fact that there was no TV! Sitting in the front room with music softly playing made me feel right at home. Thanks for everything! Steve We had a wonderful stay in this rad little house. It was quiet, cozy, and had every amenity we could have wanted - we loved the vintage radio!  The location was perfect; just a short walk or drive to everything we wanted to do in the Ballard neighborhood.  Rob and Molly were very kind and made the check-in/out process a breeze.  A great experience all around, and highly recommended!   Very cute little home/apt with an authentic style. The vintage style is real and it makes you feel like you travel in time. \\r\\nRob and Molly were great hosts: responsive and helpful, they really made everything easy and convenient. This was our second stay at Rob and Molly\\'s place and it was even better this time. In town for a week for a family wedding, we came home to fresh peonies and a chocolate bar. There was a slight issue with the shower in the middle of the stay, but we were able to reach Rob right away and it was fixed before the day was over.  We were also able to borrow various baby equipment for our 3 month old that made the stay stress free for all of us.  This is a perfect sanctuary owned by a thoughtful couple to use while exploring all Seattle has to offer.   Great place! Just as it was described. The house is pretty and everything worked fine. We didn\\'t meet Rob or Molly but they were really responsive and made sure that we had everything we needed. Location is also very good. Many buses right outside but also an easy walk to Ballard.  We never met Rob or Molly, but the apartment was all set up for us, so we had no questions.  obsessed doesn\\'t even begin to describe how we felt about this little home... we loved staying here + in the ballard neighborhood. in fact, we were able to spend our entire time in seattle just wandering around  the area, checking out all the shops, breweries and happy hour oysters. the home was perfect for our little family of 3, and our tiny especially loved sitting on the front porch + watching the passers-by. we\\'ll definitely be back! The molly and rob\\'s vintage cottage is in a very nice part of Seattle: it is  close to bus stop to downtown, to food market and nice bars and restaurants.\\nThe house itself is confortable; however, it could be better equipped.\\nIn the kitchen, for instance, additional pots and pans would be useful and the refrigerator is quite noisy. Also the house cleaning could be improved. Molly and Rob were really fast to reply to all questions and to provide us with suggestions and pratical information.\\nIn the complex our stay was fine and we really loved Seattle!! Rob and Molly don\\'t take the term \\'vintage\\' lightly...a lot of care and effort has gone into decorating and filling this place with unique vintage and retro objects. Everything from the cool dish ware to the original bathroom tile to the furniture had an old time charm to it. You won\\'t find a microwave here, but the rest of the kitchen basics are there including a funky electric kettle from days gone by. \\n\\nWe were pleased with the value of our stay.  For less than a hotel, in a city that has been reported to be more expensive than New York for accommodations during the summer, we had an entire home in an excellent location. It was great to be walking distance to several breweries and restaurants and just down the street from one of our most enjoyable coffees in Seattle (Slate Coffee). Free street parking in front of the house was always abundant. \\n\\nOther positives: clean, private, quiet (we never heard the duplex neighbours through the walls), comfortable temperatures even in warmer weather but has a giant portable fan if you need it, great shower head, everything worked, etc.  We had such a wonderful experience at this cute little house. Everything was great-- very clean, conviently located , and ample parking. I am originally from Seattle and would not consider staying anywhere else again when visiting friends and family. The hosts were very willing to help us. For us the best part of the home was the location! We experienced Ballard like the locals do, esp loving the restaurants Delancey and Essex, and the downtown parts of Ballard. The house was clean and easy to park at. The listing was accurate, place was clean and welcoming. It felt very homey! The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. I would definitely recommend this to a friend! We enjoyed staying at Rob and Molly\\'s place. Ballard is well located and filled with cool places nearby. The house is small and cute and we were able to do a load of laundry. Every morning we walked up the hill to Phinney for breakfast at a nice Japanese bakery. It was a fine stay. I wish I had drunk more of the beer Rob was kind enough to have left.  This was a great little place! We loved our stay! Rob and Molly were extremely helpful as hosts and everything was accurately described in the information provided! Would definitely recommend others to stay here! Great house, perfect neighborhood. Lovely hosts:)  Grea location!  We were able to walk to great restaurants, coffee spots, and downtown to hear some good music at an open mic night - and caught the fantastic farmers market on Sunday! Plenty of space for what we needed. No problems parking on the street, and coffee available along with a few cold ones in the frig! Molly & Rob were close if we needed - only a text away and responded quickly.  I would recommend this cozy cottage if you were visiting Seattle or Ballard. Great little place! Looks just like the pictures and is very charming, as advertised. We didn\\'t get to meet Rob and Molly in person but they were always so friendly and accommodating when we contacted them by phone/text. Check in and check out were easy and hassle free. Highly recommended! Sweet space in a great location. It had everything we needed and was as listed. Rob and Molly provided a comfy home away from home. Really enjoyed all the amenities that were within walking distance. Loved that our dogs were welcome and it was great having an enclosed side yard for them.  We enjoyed our stay at Rob and Molly\\'s sweet apartment. It was clean and adorable. Rob and Molly were always available by cell or text and helped us out immediately with a few problems we encountered. Thank you Rob and Molly for providing a home away from home while we visited our son! This place is absolutely adorable and was a really nice stay for my husband, young son and I. The location can\\'t be beat. The house is very convenient to the bus, walking to coffee or snacks and Ballard Market or Safeway. Having the kitchen for warming up meals for our 1 year old or making snacks to take with us was a huge help.  The only downsides to the spot is first- the shower could use a little repair. While it was clean, it is peeling paint and showing wear. Second, we found the couch in the living room to be unusable for sitting (we did not roll it out), it was just too worn out to be comfortable. Even with these small issues we still found the house to be a great value for the price.  The house was exactly as described. Very clean and spacious. Nice neighborhood and just close enough to downtown. Also lots of things to do in a short drive. Good parking! The place was clean and nicely located. Rob and Molly were great hosts. The home was lovely and well appointed.  We were very happy with the location as well!   rob and molly were terrific!  they were remarkably prompt and wonderfully hospitable.  the house was cozy, clean, well furnished and perfectly located.  it was just what we needed! I took my Mother to Seattle to visit my daughter, and wanted to stay in my daughter\\'s neighborhood The house was exactly like the photos, cute , clean and a little quirky. The location was perfect for us - in Ballard, near shopping, nightlife, main roads to Seattle, and my daughter\\'s apartment! Rob and Molly were prompt to respond, and extremely helpful when we had questions about the house and the area. I would totally recommend Rob and Molly and their properties to any Airbnb-ers.  Cute home, accurate description aside from only one beer in fridge ;-P  We had a fantastic time! Thank you so much for having is, especially on such short notice. The bed was one of the comfiest I\\'ve ever slept in. (: My mom enjoyed a beverage or two from the fridge and the coffee in the morning. It was easy to find, right near the bus stops (like you said) and only a few blocks from restaurants that we really enjoyed! Also, being from out of the States, having access to Wifi was great. Thank you so much again!  My family of 4 stayed very comfortably in this delightful, 1-bedroom, 1-bath, larger vintage home with a really great location and proximity to everything around Seattle. We all really used the home, cooked lots of meals and used the pull-out sofa bed every night. Everything included in the home works fine, and we even did several loads of laundry which was located in the older basement, but all was functional. \\r\\nIf you like the charm of an older home, you will love this unit just fine. \\r\\nThere is also a side yard for our boxer to hang out in, but might recommend more chairs if you have more than 2 staying. \\r\\nWe also loved the fact that you can walk to really nice grocery stores full of organic foods. \\r\\nHats off to Rob and Molly for a really nice stay :) \\r\\n Our stay with Rob and Molly was perfect.  It was a cozy, convenient place to stay.   The location is unsurpassed.   It felt very welcoming and had some wonderful amenities (coffee, beer, laundry).  It was great for my family and my 2 large dogs.  Rob and Molly were available, but unobtrusive.  I would definitely stay with them again on future visits.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Very vintage, as described.  The place was easy to find and parking was always available.  Lots of hot water. Very close to wonderful central Ballard hipness.  Neighbors very quiet and friendly. Thanks for the fresh coffee and the colas. A cute, nice spot! We didn\\'t meet Rob & Molly, but everything was simple & straight-forward.  The description of the amenities were very accurate .\\r\\nThe host was right there upon our arrival and helped us immediately to find the key and left clear instructions if we needed any help \\r\\nWe liked the little apartment . It suited our needs.  Very good wifi\\r\\nCouch in living room is worn out \\r\\nHouse has a worn look from outside Loved our stay at Rob and Molly\\'s place!  It\\'s cute, clean, comfortable, and in a great neighborhood - close to many restaurants and breweries!  It was exactly as I expected, and I cannot wait to come back again for another visit! Rob and Molly left us a warm welcome of flowers, local chocolate and wine. Immediately upon arriving, it felt like home, which is a great comfort when traveling. \\r\\nThe house was clean and neat with plenty of clean towels and linens for our use. There was a stack of tourist guides and local news sources to give us great ideas of sites to see, food to eat, and places to go.  \\r\\nDespite being in a major traffic artery, the noise of cars was minimal and not disruptive, and the convenience of being near a great grocery, local restaurants and walkable breweries far outweighed the minor noise. Parking on the street in front was always a breeze, regardless of time of day or day of the week. \\r\\nI would stay here again and again.  The place was perfect for my work trip. Cozy, comfortable and the hosts were very attentive. Our weekend in Ballard was superb!  The house was adorable, exactly as described, very charming and \"retro\".  Close to all the action, we were able to walk all over the place in spite of the famous Puget Sound rain.  And the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  Seriously, I would come back just for the bed!  Advice to any out-of-towners, make sure you visit the Chittenden locks while you are in town, very interesting visitor centre there. lovely and clean, and I found all i needed,\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are so many good things about this place including ease with parking, a place for my dogs and close to downtown.  Though the house is on a main road, it was quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\n We absolutely loved our stay in Ballard! Rob and Molly were very accommodating with our check in and check out times and their place was exactly what we were looking for - vintage and charming. Even though the cottage is older it seemed very well insulated and the heat warmed the place up quickly enough for us thin-blooded southern Californians. I especially appreciated the list of nearby recommendations provided and the treats of coffee and beer left for us. Our first visit to Seattle was a wonderful one - thanks Rob & Molly!  I needed a quick place to stay for one night while some construction was done on my home in Ballard and this was the perfect spot. A sweet little vintage duplex, with a lovely kitchen and plenty of space! It reminded me of my first apartment in LA! Rob and Molly were very responsive. I\\'d definitely recommend the place! Rob and Molly are spot on when it comes to the description of the place and it is an amazing vintage Ballard throwback (but with good taste). They were super responsive and check-in was a breeze, and they allowed my dog to come! More importantly, they left local coffee and beer in the fridge upon arrival .... I felt very at home. This is an adorable house less than a mile from Ballard\\'s main drag. It was extremely clean when we arrived, and had everything you\\'d need while away from home. Fixtures are definitely vintage, but they all work, and it adds to the charm of the house.  Rob and Molly\\'s Ballard beauty was truly wonderful to stay in. Spacious, comfy and perfect for a nice weekend in Seattle, so nicely set up we could have stayed much longer in comfort, alas time was short for this visit to Seattle.  Love! We really enjoyed our stay at this great spot. Adorable, quaint, and just the place we were looking for!\\n\\nRob and Molly are awesome hosts! From booking, and all the way past departure; we had a great experience. \\n\\nCute setup, as the decor was totally fab!  So many of the items, down to the toaster, glassware, tables, chairs, original wood floors - all totally circa 40\\'s-1950 - you really are walking into a historical flashback.\\n\\nSomething particularly enjoyable (iop) is you\\'re a bit off the \"tech\" grid, if you choose to be. While there\\'s excellent WiFi, you\\'re blessed with no TV, no micro, no need to \"sit around online\" or laze away with Netflix. \\n\\nCan\\'t say enough about how super amazing Molly and Rob are as hosts. Great hosts always makes a difference. I\\'ll def check their calendar again when back in Seatown... We so enjoyed our stay in this accommodation.  Susan was great, and we loved the house; the kitchen was so nice we entertained there instead of at our son\\'s apartment.  Close to two bus lines.  And a neighborhood cat wandered in twice for a visit.  The bed was good for us.  Definitely will make this our home away from home in Seattle in the future. Susan was very helpful since we weren\\'t sure when we would arrive. She had yummy pastries waiting for us.  The listing is accurate.  The house is beautiful and we really enjoyed cooking in the bright and airy kitchen. Susan was very accommodating and the apartment was fantastic! We were able to check in a little early with no issues at all. Susan had some snacks and coffee available for us in the kitchen and left a nice welcome note in the bedroom. The apartment itself was beautiful, extremely clean and spacious. The location was great for us as we wanted to explore Ballard and Green Lake. Perfect stay!  Lovely treetop view of Ballard and --in gorgeous sunshine-- the Olympic mountains! Cute and eclectic decor, a bright and welcoming home to stay in. Susan met us and explained the few things we needed to know. She left us delicious pound cake for our breakfast and vanished away. :)  Comfortable neighborhood close to Ballard, Fremont, and Queen Anne. Easy to find and minutes from where we needed to be. What a lovely place! It is beautifully and creatively decorated, comfortable, and well-situated. Susan was a generous host to us, providing an extra air mattress and ensuring we were all comfortable. When we locked ourselves out of the house, she was there immediately to let us back in!  Her two sweet cats guarded the house well. \\n\\nHighly recommended, we\\'ll definitely be back again! We loved staying here!  The home was beautiful!  I was recovering from jetlag and was so happy to find a deliciously comfortable bed to rest my weary body.  The place is full of natural light, which I loved.   Street parking was available right in front of the home and everything we were doing was just minutes away in Fremont.  I would definitely stay here again.  It really felt like home! Susan\\'s beautiful late 1920s character home is in perfect condition with a gorgeous skylit kitchen and a lovely bath. Susan takes great care of her guests providing coffee, tea, a great bed, books,  games galore and more. Her home is on a great block, walking distance to Ballard and Freemont. I had such a restful, relaxing stay that i plan to return.  Susan\\'s Seattle Charm was a delight to stay in. Its very spacious with perfect amenities for a vacation in Seattle. The location is unbeatable, with bus stops near by as well as grocery stores. Ballard is a fun neighborhood with an awesome restaurant and night life scene to explore.\\nSusan was beyond accommodating and she was a great host to work with. If we come back to Seattle, we\\'ll definitely stay at her place if it\\'s available!! Susan was a great host with a lovely home.  The space was exactly as described and truly charming!  We were delighted to receive a home baked treat several times and we were made to feel at home.  Great quiet neighborhood; walking distance from Fremont and Ballard.  Easy street parking, plenty of books, games, kitchen supplies, bedding, and towels, plus a comfy bed.  We hope to come stay again next year! Susan met us and made us feel welcome at once.  We had to move out of our condo which is only about 2 miles away as we were having the upstairs bedrooms recarpeted.  Susan\\'s beautiful rental was a \\'home away from home\\' for us.  She has thought of everything.  The bed was extremely cozy and comfortable, nice shower with lots of lotions and toiletries for our use.  The kitchen is large and very well equipped with a nice patio to sit outside. Lovely wood floors and lots of natural light.  It is exactly as the photos show, but even bigger than we expected. The location is fabulous.  Loads of excellent restaurants in nearby Ballard.  If you don\\'t want to drive you can ride the bus or take Uber. You can also take the bus downtown Seattle, it takes about 25 to 30 minutes depending on time of day. \\r\\nWe would highly recommend renting from Susan.  You won\\'t regret it.  We are experienced AirBnb renters nationally and internationally(15 with this one). We would consider this to be in our top rentals. Susan is very good about communicating with me prior to my arrival.  We text each other and she responds very quickly. Our first airbnb experience was better than expected. The location was perfect. Everything was as advertised and a bit more. Homemade muffins, coffee and goodies in the frig for breakfast. The view on the little deck in the evenings and early morning was a treat. The bed was wonderful. Although we never saw Susan as we slipped in and out for the weekend, she was gracious and quickly answered our questions via text and the airbnb app. We\\'ll definitely stay in the future when visiting our daughters in Seattle. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Susan,\\r\\nBeth & Jeff Susan was great and her home is beautiful. When I arrived, she showed me around the apartment and provided many great suggestions for places to eat in Ballard. She\\'d provided coffee, tea, milk, snacks, and tea cakes, which I enjoyed in her huge kitchen and out on the patio. Susan is welcoming, the place is perfect, and you\\'ll not be disappointed. Susan was such a great host! Made us feel at home. We couldn\\'t be more thankful. Especially being there for our wedding & never visiting the area before. Her house was absolutely beautiful. We had a great experience staying in Ballard. Her home is located at a convenient location to everything. From finding amazing places to eat, parks, grocery stores. Downtown Seattle is only a 5 minute drive.  The listing is accurate, yet the description doesn\\'t capture the full charm of the wonderful heritage home tucked away on a quiet street in one of Seattle\\'s eclectic neighbourhoods. The unit was very clean, with a large living room for reading or watching the modern television setup, and a kitchen well-lit with natural light tucked away for dinner and coffee. Coffee, tea and pound cake were provided, which I thought was a nice touch. I loved the wooden ceiling in the living room and the wooden window trim.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was very prompt and professional in her correspondence with us, and we were able to book with ease. Very happy to have stayed with Susan and look forward to doing so again.  We spent a lovely night in Susan\\'s place.  It\\'s charming, cozy, eclectic and felt like home within about five minutes.  She left us yummy baked treats, which we enjoyed in the morning with coffee on the deck looking out to the mountains.  There were so many lovely touches--interesting books, slippers, killer coffee, flowers--and Susan herself could not have been more helpful or welcoming.   We could have stayed and stayed! Susan\\'s apartment is a true gem! I feel so lucky to have found it. The apartment is very spacious and decorated in a relaxing, homey style. The neighborhood is very quiet and in a central location. I highly recommend it! Susan\\'s place was a lot more \"charming\" than we expected. Really nice spot. The place was clean. The neighborhood seemed pretty laid-back. The only things that may be negatives for some is that you can hear through the walls a bit, and that it\\'s a fairly long walk (~20 mins) to the main streets of Ballard. But we really enjoyed it. Thanks, Susan! From the moment we entered the suite, we were awestruck by the beauty and home-like ambience of Susan\\'s accommodations.  Susan\\'s thoughtfulness in stocking the kitchen with all the necessities left nothing to be desired.  The neighborhood was very quiet and we had a most restful sleep.  We would definitely stay in this suite again on our next return to Ballard.  Thanks again Susan for providing us a home away from home! Susan was easily to contact. Everything we needed was available to us. The neighborhood was quiet and close to many stores.  I couldn\\'t have asked for a better Seattle apartment for our stay. Susan immediately made us feel welcome and greeted us at the door. The sun filled apartment contained all of the amenities we could have wanted, and Susan provided baked treats for breakfast. She also stopped by on a particularly hot day to offer sunscreen. The apartment was comfortable and clean,  well decorated and conveniently located. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone and will consider staying here again on my next trip to Seattle.  Seattle Charm is certainly charming. The apartment is even larger (and sunnier!) than it appears in photos, which was a pleasant surprise. We never met Susan during our 5 day stay; though we were aware that she was around the property occasionally. \\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was a gracious host... the apartment was clean, (it was like staying with a friend or relative - don\\'t look TOO hard for dust/cobwebs); and she left some small baked goods for us, as well as coffee; which was greatly appreciated. We did use the kitchen several times, and found everything we needed to prepare our meals. The local Trader Joe\\'s is 4 mins away by car. \\r\\n\\r\\nBe aware that there are tenants living on the ground floor of the house, as well as someone (it changed) staying in the apartment above. The walls/floor/ceilings are rather thin, and you can hear quite a lot of the goings on (music, conversations, footsteps, etc).  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe absolutely loved the area (nestled between Fremont/Wallingford/Ballard/Phinney Ridge), but feel it is definitely suited to having a car (we had a rental while there). Parking was sometimes tight on the street, but always available. As for the neighborhood itself, there isn\\'t much in the way of food or entertainment. It is very residential, as expected. We spent a lot of time in nearby Ballard (5-10 mins by car), which we adored.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe WiFi was problematic for us... (my brand new iPhone 6+ would constantly get kicked off). It wasn\\'t worth the frustration to reconnect every 3 minutes. If WiFi is extremely important to you, that would be a consideration.  Though we didn\\'t ever use it, we appreciated the availability of the Roku/TV. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cats were shy, and didn\\'t bother us in the least. (I\\'m allergic, so I wasn\\'t looking for them to be underfoot while outside). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe small back deck is completely lovely. We spent a lot of time out there in the evenings, having a glass of wine, and watching the sun set behind the rooftops. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, we definitely recommend staying at Seattle Charm if you\\'re looking to experience the non-touristy side of Seattle.  Thanks Susan!\\r\\n  absolutely enjoyed our stay, comfortable and tastefully appointed accommodation, close to Ballard restaurants and night life. Susan is a delightful host. Absolutely a showcase airbnb experience. Highly recommend & intend to book next time in Seattle.  Susan provides a delightful stay in Seattle. She\\'s a helpful, informative and friendly host, and her apartment has so much character and charm. It has a great kitchen and comfortable living areas. Ballard is a cool neighbourhood -- Susan\\'s suggestion of local eateries (we\\'d recommend Bourbon & Bones) were all within walking distance. The Fred Meyer grocery store was a short drive (though you could still walk) but has everything you need, plus more. It was easy to catch the bus into the central city, and the apartment\\'s location meant you were away from the inner city traffic mayhem. We\\'d highly recommend the apartment. Thanks Susan for a wonderful stay. Susan made us feel very welcome.  It was easy to get into the apartment and it was furnished with everything we needed, and more.  She was very quick to bring us an extra fan to help with the unusually hot weather we experienced.  The 3rd bed was a small chaise lounge that folded down flat and she brought us an extra foam padding for it.  It was the perfect size for our 11-year old - - who declared it the most comfortable bed \"ever.\"  The view from her place was great and felt like we were at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, Susan! Our visit to Seattle was wonderful and care free. Susan made the stay easy and hassle free. Her place is described perfectly on the site and was great for the 4 of us. The location was nice and all of our needs were met. Susan was a great host and we\\'d happily stay there again.  We were visiting from Vancouver for a concert in downtown Ballard. After being stuck in a 3 hour border wait in the hot sun, we were tired, hot and hungry. Walking into Susan\\'s lovely apartment we found a beautiful breeze wafting through the open windows, a fan in both the bedroom and living room and some snacks in the fridge, including a little banana loaf. All were very appreciated. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment is gorgeous and clean. We were traveling with my Mother-in-Law so she sleep soundly in the queen sized bed in the bedroom and my Husband and I slept on the futon in the living room. Susan left us clean sheets, and there were extra blankets in the bedroom. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn\\'t spend a lot of time in the apartment during our stay, and we didn\\'t meet Susan, but all our needs were met. We wanted to be able to walk to and from downtown Ballard which were able to do easily in about 20 min. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs mentioned in another review, the walls are thin as is typical in a character home. If you are sensitive to noise you may want to stay in a newer home. We are musicians so for us the character and proximity were worth a bit of noise. \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite not meeting Susan, we found her gracious and accommodating. We enjoyed our stay.  Susan was great and accommodating, we loved our stay! Susan was a very gracious host and made us feel welcome and at home. The pound cake, yogurts, and presence of other kitchen staples (nice tea collection, coffee) were appreciated. The house is lovely, tasteful and comfortable. It was quiet and we were undisturbed. We walked to Ballard and had a delicious dinner one night, but otherwise were glad we had a car to get around the city. I would recommend this home to anyone who wanted a serene and beautiful place to stay in Seattle. Great stay. Clean, private and well appointed place to rest and visit a couple craft beer locations in Seattle. I would recommend Susan\\'s place in Ballard to anyone! Thanks Susan. We so enjoyed our stay at Susan\\'s place -- it is absolutely charming.  I am aesthetically-oriented, so really loved how the house is decorated and all the artistic touches.  We were visiting for a wedding and had come off a 3 day whirlwind of social activities, and Susan\\'s place was a calm, peaceful and welcoming environment.  Susan was a great host -- very accessible, responsive and thoughtful.  The place was spotless, the location quiet but convenient to the Ballard business district, and the overall experience just delightful.  We will definitely try to stay again on our next visit to Seattle. First sorry for the delay, we just finished our trip and came back home. Susan\\'s house was so pretty and clean. The community was quite and safe, also it\\'s easy to find food nearby. Susan is very nice and communicative, she left everything clear. We definitely had a great time there. Susan is such a hospitable and accommodating hostess. We wanted to check in earlier than 3 to get ready for the wedding that evening and she was more than happy to welcome us to her place as early as 1 pm. As we arrived and checked in to her lovely house she even informed us ahead of time about the possible road closure and traffic jam that weekend due to an event downtown. Her house is beautifully kept and everything we needed for the stay was provided. My family had such a lovely stay and rest in Seattle at Susan\\'s. Definitely will recommend Susan\\'s place to our friends and family and looking forward to another visit. Thank you.  A group of 4 of us (2 couples) stayed at Susan\\'s home in Seattle. It was in a beautiful location and the home was very well maintained even though it was an older home. In fact, we wouldn\\'t have wanted it any other way. The home was stunning, and it was obvious that Susan took great care of the place and wanted every guest to feel at home, which we did. \\n\\nEverything we needed to know was provided to us either in the airbnb page or her personal binder present in the home. We had a great experience and highly recommend this getaway to anyone interested. \\n\\nThanks, Susan! \\n\\nLauren & Tim We found Susan\\'s place to be exactly as described in her listing. It was comfortable, spacious and well appointed.  The neighborhood feels rural for being in a city and we were always able to park our rental car right in front. The heart of the Ballard neighborhood is a short drive (or 20 minute walk) away, with lots of interesting shops and restaurants to explore. We were able to get to just about everywhere we wanted to visit with a 15 minute drive. Susan was a great host and responded immediately to any questions we had. She also provided us with fresh baked goods almost every day of our stay. This is a great place for a relaxed stay in Seattle. Seattle Charm is an apt description for this lovely place. As others have said, it\\'s even better than the pictures, which can\\'t fully capture the views of mountains, big trees, and fun little backyard garden. We stayed for 6 nights during our first trip ever to Seattle. It was a great place for an extended stay--nicely decorated, very clean, and well outfitted with everything we needed. A friend joined us for part of our stay, making us 3 guests, and the place was spacious enough to accommodate all of us. The kitchen/eating area is especially nice with lots of windows and light--a great place for breakfast before our days in the city. The apartment is in a nice, quiet neighborhood and is pretty conveniently located. We were carless and managed fine taking buses. I highly recommend Susan\\'s place and would definitely stay there again if we return to this beautiful part of the country! Susan\\'s apartment provided a lovely stay for my family of four on our trip to Seattle. The space was clean, warm and inviting, very generous in size, and beautifully decorated. Susan provided lots of options for breakfast, which was so nice after spending so much time in restaurants over the previous several days. The location was very convenient to downtown Seattle, but there were also great options in the neighborhood of Ballard. I would definitely recommend Susan\\'s place and would stay there again in a heartbeat. Susan was a great host for myself and my dad on our very first trip to Seattle. Her place is very similar to the way it is described on her page, and suited us well for our needs. It was clear that a cat lived there, so if smell or dander bother you, I would recommend taking that into consideration. We didn\\'t overlap with Susan very much, but she would text me to check in and see if we needed anything. The area was very quiet, which was nice, but we found that we definitely appreciated having rented a car for our trip. There was plenty of on street parking right in front of the house. Overall, we had a great trip and would definitely consider staying with Susan again! This is the first time that I have stayed at an air bnb, and it definitely will not be the last. Susan is a very attentive and welcoming host and we had a most excellent stay.  She brought us milk and creamer for our morning coffee when we arrived & we did not have to go to the store. Her home is very cozy and charming indeed, we felt at home right away.  There are books everywhere, antique postcards, animal-shaped candle holders, and lovely throw pillows. The neighborhood is quiet, safe and close to the best of Ballard.  It was very nice to have a kitchen to enjoy breakfast in pj\\'s and make late-night popcorn.  A true gem, mostly because of Susan, would stay there again.   We had a completely charmed experience that was unfortunately only one night as we journeyed on from Ballard to the San Juans. Susan\\'s place reflected her own fine taste, with everything from furnishings to pillows to books (copious numbers of them, strategically placed so you\\'re never not running into a book!) carefully chosen and rendered. Though only one-bedroom, it has a sense of spaciousness in room size and layout that made it appear anything but cramped. Lovely little deck out back, window seats, quiet street, close to Ballard\\'s many downtown delights. Major LIKE from here! We really felt at home at Susan\\'s.  The place is lovely and immaculately clean.  Susan thoughtfully provided all the goodies for a nice breakfast the first morning.  The book selection was amazing and we really enjoyed hanging out and relaxing \\'at home\\'.  The location worked perfectly for us: quiet neighborhood, near public transport & walking distance to Ballard. Also convenient if you have a car as there appeared to be ample parking on the street. Would definitely like to come back. Susan was quick to engage me through a text or phone call, provided accurate details about how to access the house and where keys were left. The home was incredibly beautiful and I\\'ve already suggested her Ballard location to my family members. Other have mentioned the faint smell of cats; while some may have felt it important to note this as a nuisance its more important to note that for two extremely allergic guest this cat thing was not a problem. There are outdoor cats at the property, but with 100% certainty I can say that this charmer is fur free and exquisitely clean.  I would definitely stay again.  What a great place! Perfectly situated to get to all that Seattle has to offer, Susan\\'s wonderful cottage has everything you need. And what a great host. Super friendly, super helpful, we\\'ll definitely be back. Thanks Susan! What a beautiful home! It\\'s rare to find a house like this with so much history, and yet so well maintained. There was an amazing attention to detail, and yet the home felt very comfortable and cozy. \\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was a great host, and was quick to respond when we needed anything. We really enjoyed Ballard as well, with all of it\\'s great shops and restaurants. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, a wonderful experience.  We were in town to see some friends, but I was just as happy to spend all weekend reading in this wonderful home. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis beautiful apartment occupies the bottom floor of Susan\\'s house. (Your entrance is separate.) It\\'s welcoming, spacious, and lovingly decorated, with high ceilings, comfortable furniture, an eclectic selection of books to borrow, and nice wide window seats. We got a great night\\'s sleep in the supportive bed. I especially loved the bright and generously proportioned kitchen, with its basket of interesting teas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s an older house, so expect creaky floors when your hosts are walking about upstairs. (They\\'re not at all loud; it\\'s just the nature of the house.) If you don\\'t mind that, Susan\\'s apartment is the absolute perfect place to stay in Ballard. We certainly hope to be back! Susan had great communication and was flexible with check-in and check-out. The house was lovely, clean, and perfectly Seattle (as advertised) This place is fantastic and my in laws really enjoyed it here. Really no complaints at all. We actually stayed at another Airbnb rental down the block but I preferred this place. Ballard is great area with some really good restaurants nearby like brimmer & healtap for a higher end dining experience and veraci for some excellent pizza. One of the best coffee houses, Slate is nearby as well and worth a visit. Safeway nearby, about a 10 minute walk. Also some nice craft beer joints with food trucks. We went to Stoup and Reuben\\'s. I will definitely come here again as it would be fine for family of 4. Seattle Charm is a lovely quiet home in an equally quiet neighborhood.   Susan\\'s welcoming baked goods are nice after a long day of travel.  A variety of reading material, board games, and an extra down comforter round things out if you have any time for lounging at her place.  Susan\\'s apartment is as beautiful as it looks in the photos; it was a very comfortable place to stay. One of the best airbnb experiences we have had. Minor (but important) things: the heat worked really well, and it\\'s very easy to park on the street. Highly recommended!  Our host had wine and flowers waiting for us. We felt very welcome. Alan and Katence really made us feel welcome and at home. The guest house was exactly as described. Every email and question was answered before and during our stay. The Ballard neighborhood was fun and we explored Fremont by bus too. Wonderful restaurants within walking. We appreciated information brochures and maps on nearby neighborhoods. We recommend this great place to stay. What a great get away! Located in the very fun and adorable Ballard neighborhood, this listing was absolutely perfect for our long holiday weekend in Seattle. \\r\\nThe house is so cute! Extremely clean and well appointed, it was exactly as advertised. Definitely enough space for ourselves, another couple, and their toddler. The kitchen came in extremely handy for early morning breakfasts, snacks, and a final night of easy dinner. It was clean and had all the creature comforts of home (comfy couch and beds/towels/full kitchen/great shower). Parking was not a hassle at all and we were easily able to park in front of the location all weekend.\\r\\nLocated just 15 minutes from downtown Seattle, this place allowed us to get to all the touristy spots quite easily while also letting us explore the charming Ballard neighborhood. Alan & Katence were kind enough to leave us with a very extensive list of recommendations as well as a great brewery map. Extremely helpful!\\r\\nAlan & Katence were extremely communicative and very pleasant. Although it turned out that we couldn\\'t check in until late in the afternoon, they were kind enough to recommend a great seafood spot as well as provided updates on the availability of the place throughout the day.\\r\\nHaving such a nice, cozy place to come back to really helped us rest and relax in between adventures. My husband and I would definitely come back here again. Thank you, Alan and Katence!    This little house is simply well appointed and charming!  We had a great long weekend stay.  Not only is the house comfortable but it also has everything you need if you decide to stay in which is a hard decision to make considering the location.  Great restaurants and pubs lie within minutes of the house in either direction although you are nestled in a quiet little neighborhood.  Additionally there is a great Sunday farmer\\'s market on Ballard Ave.  Wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay at Alan & Katence\\'s house again! Alan and Katence were wonderful hosts.  Their house was in a perfect location for our stay, charming and very comfortable.  Even better than the pictures! The kitchen was well equipped and they provided us with a list of personal suggestions of sights to see and yummy eats to try as well.  The location was perfect for walking into Ballard restaurants and coffee spots. It was easy access to all other major Seattle activities as well.  We would definitely stay here again!  Thanks! The house is lovely, light and spacious, and beautifully decorated.  Check in was easy and communication with the hosts fast and simple.  The house is in a great neighborhood--safe, well maintained houses. We walked everywhere (we did not have a car). Easy walk to grocery store, coffee shops, and restaurants.  I took public transportation form the airport and the house is located 3 blocks from the bus stop.   This was an attractive and comfortable place in a great location for my family and my sister and niece. Alan and Katence left a nice personalized note for us, and a thorough list of local restaurants and bars. We had great privacy and didn\\'t see the downstairs renter at all. We were able to walk to Ballard restaurants and shops from the house. Parking was easily available in front of the house\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not as spacious as some other places that sleep six, so for a group that size, you may feel a bit on top of each other. They provided a few snacks and beer/wine for an extra charge, but you\\'ll want to bring things like coffee or tea if you want to have those on hand.  We love downtown Ballard as one of Seattle\\'s most walkable and charming neighborhoods offering a Farmer\\'s market, pubs, jazz music on weekend nights, gelato, and a well equipped local Ballard grocery store. Alan and Katence\\'s house is about a mile from my favorite Ballard pub. The upper floor where we stayed for 3 nights, was clean and decorated tastefully with an eye for detail, local artifacts and catering to the needs of visitors. I was thrilled to find local beer in the fridge which I could either restock at the market or pay for at pretty much the same price.\\n\\nAlan and Katence checked up on us the day after we arrived to make sure we had all we needed.\\n\\nHighly recommended! Alan & Katence were very responsive and helpful at confirming our last minute day of request to stay. The house was super cute and exactly what my friends and I were looking for to accommodate our vacation / tour of the Seattle neighborhoods. Full kitchen perfect for our purposes. Location wise the house was great and walkable to Ballard Ave. and restaurants. The Phinney Ballard Retreat was very nice! It was a great location close to restaurants and convenient to downtown Ballard and Seattle. In a very quiet neighborhood! Alan and Kadence were very accommodating! Thank You! This was a perfect place for us to stay while visiting Seattle.  We enjoyed a wonderful tapas restaurant right in downtown Ballard and we were able to use convenient public transport to go downtown Seattle to see the sights there. The house was very clean, well furnished and inviting. Alan even brought us an additional fan/AC unit because the weather was extremely hot when we were there.  We would definitely go back if we are in the Seattle area again.\\r\\nDarlene & Phil This Ballard Retreat was very clean and cozy with comfortable furniture throughout. The notes throughout the house were a nice touch. The highlights were the comfy beds and games in the living room. Great rental to feel right at home! I would definitely return if I\\'m in the area again. Thanks Alan and Katence! Alan and Katence were great. Good communication, lots of great relevant information to the local town. Great experience all around Alan and Katence made us feel welcome from the first contact. I live in Idaho and had family from Norway passing thru Seattle. The beautiful phinney ridge home was perfect for the 5 cousins (2 adults, 3 teens). Everyone was very happy to be staying at Alan and Katence\\'s home and not a hotel, the space is prettier than the pictures, spotlessly clean, comfortable furniture, beds and linens.  The location was also perfect for all the popular Seattle sights to see in such a short visit, and was extra special to be so close to Ballard (little Norway) I would highly recommend this home. Thank you so much Alan and Katence, sorry not to meet you! And thank you for your great communication from start to end, happy you and your place are in our happy memories! Alan and Katence provided an excellent Seattle experience for my family.  The house is well located in Ballard, near the locks, zoo, and the restaurant areas of both Fremont and Ballard.  There are solid local restaurants and grocery shopping within walking distance of the house.  The layout of the house maximizes space really well and can suitably accomodate a family of four.   The hosts were very responsive to our requests. For example, we were hosting some friends for dinner and we realized that the propane tank in the grill was empty.  A simple text and thirty minutes later the propane tank was filled!  We had a neat experience with a neighbor, when we asked him for directions to a store to buy a nighlight for the kid\\'s room, the guy just gave us a spare one from his own home. Seattle at its best! We just got back from our stay and LOVED the house! It\\'s the perfect location--a laundromat right around the corner, great pizza and coffee a block away, and tons of great restaurants and grocery stores 2-3 blocks further. Alan and Katence made it very easy to check-in and out, and the house is beautifully furnished and decorated. Also, I\\'ve stayed at many rental homes over the years, but this ranks as one of the cleanest I\\'ve ever been to. I especially appreciated the anti-allergen covers on all the mattresses and the snowy white linens! The kids loved playing in the front yard and my husband and I enjoyed dessert on the porch every evening after the kids were in bed. Parking was always easy, even when our cousin or friend visited us. We plan to return to Seattle and definitely hope to stay in this charming home again. We arrived at our Ballard home late(ish), and were SO happy to find 2 bottles of hand picked wine waiting for us (you could just leave $ in exchange).  We stayed there with 4 of us, we have 2 little girls.  The place was just the right size for us, more would have been a bit crowded.  It was perfectly appointed, fans, soft sheets and towels, all the dishes/cooking tools we needed (and we even cooked up a feast after the Ballard market).  It was truly a home away from home- very clean and in perfect condition.  We could walk to everything-- it was the right spot for us, and we can\\'t wait to return!!!  Thank you so much!!! We were exceptionally pleased with our stay in Alan and Katence\\'s home in Ballard.  The house and location were perfect for our needs.  We were in Seattle for our son\\'s wedding which was at the Ballard Hotel only a few minutes away.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe hosts were gracious and responsive; answering questions and assisting if needed.  The house itself was lovingly cared for and tastefully decorated---a little gem and just the right size for us.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe layout of the inside was just right too.  Bedrooms in the back were quiet and private and the front kitchen/dining/living area was open and airy--with plenty of room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bathroom had essentials like towels and hair dryer and the kitchen was outfitted with plenty of cooking ware, coffee maker, etc. We greatly appreciated these amenities during our 8 day stay since we cooked quite a bit--making several trips up the street to the local Town & Country grocery.  (Tip:  Their fried chicken is very good, my husband quickly discovered.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn between all of our activities, we relaxed often on the front porch with a glass of wine enjoying a few minutes of quiet.  And good news for anyone from the Midwest or the South---no mosquitoes! \\r\\n\\r\\nAside from the wedding, we also did some sight-seeing and the location of the house provided easy access to main roads for trekking downtown; going to the  Ballard Locks, Seattle Ferries, the Beach and even area farmers markets.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all we had a wonderful trip and are confident that it was made more so because of our stay at the\"Beautiful Phinney/Ballard Retreat\"!  Thanks so much Alan and Katence!! Alan & Katence were awesome! They were quick to respond to our inquiries regarding the location, home and arrival details.  The accomodations was perfect for our mini-family get together to watch the pre-season game between Broncos and Seahawks. The bus to downtown (28) was literally two blocks away from us and dropped us off two blocks from the stadium.  The location is central to many breweries (Reubans is our new fav) and farmer\\'s markets!  The four of us slept comfortably in the two-bedroom suite . . . and soundly! It was perfect for enjoying some down time while we waited for the occasional rain shower to pass. The kitchen had all the utensils of home -- which helped with our breakfasts in.  Thank you guys for a wonderful stay!  We really enjoyed staying at Alan and Katence\\'s place.  Thank you so much for having us.  The accommodations were very comfortable and the neighborhood was great! The house was just as described and very clean and comfortable. It\\'s in a quiet area with road parking right outside the front door. It has a large bedroom with a queen bed and the second bedroom has a double bed. We took the #28 bus which is just around the corner into Seattle and its only  20 mins to downtown. \\r\\n Great neighborhood, super clean and bright house, we were comfortable and very happy-!  Great spot for a quick stay in Seattle. The house was clean, beds were super comfortable and we had everything we needed to cook. There was easy parking out front and we were a quick walk from the main stretch in Ballard. Alan and Katence were super friendly and responsive -- we had a great experience! This house was great all around! Great space and great location. We were traveling with our 8 month old and the house was set up perfectly for a kiddo. We loved it! Great place, great location! We had our 8 month old and felt like the place was perfectly suited for a kiddo. Very simple decorations, comfy, and cute. The hosts were super helpful with recommendations around the area and we look forward to going there again soon! Alan and Katence were very responsive.  We really enjoyed staying in the neighborhood of Ballard.  The home was bright, cheerful and comfortable, and we really enjoyed the gas fireplace with the cool Seattle weather.  The location of the home is close to the convenience of main streets (shops, restaurants, breweries, transportation), but is far enough away to be quiet.   Absolutely wonderful retreat in Ballard!   Perfectly located if you want to stay in Ballard or easily get to all of Seattle\\'s best neighborhoods.  House is adorable and well appointed and beds are very comfy:) Excellent, responsive hosts!!  Alan and Katence’s home was the perfect hub for a weekend wedding getaway (a friend’s, not ours ;).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe arrived greeted by fresh flowers and a guide to Ballard. The house is cute, clean and feels like home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks so much for an easy and relaxing experience. Would love to stay again! Reese was a phenomenal host and her apartment was perfect for a quick stay over in Seattle. Though we I did not get to meet her in person, she was in communication as needed and very helpful. I would recommend her apartment to anyone wanting to hang out in the very cool Ballard neighborhood or to have something a little removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown.  Will definitely be staying here again when I return to Seattle.  Reese was a wonderful host, very prompt to answer any messages and inquiries we had. She was very acomodating and sweet. I would highly recommend anyone who wants to see the heart of the PNW to stay here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was beautiful, incredibly well located, clean, cozy, and with everything one might need for a fantastic stay in Ballard.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall a great experience.\\r\\n Reese was extremely good at communicating and provided a very clean & comfortable place to stay in Seattle. I would definitely recommend staying with Reese to all. My stay at Nicole\\'s surpassed all my expectations. Her home is beautiful, super comfortable, and conveniently located in a very safe, fun neighborhood. The guest space comes with an open outdoor patio with a garden. She provides very nice bedding and a Keurig coffeemaker in the guest room with organic coffee (or alternatives if you prefer tea, decaf or hot chocolate). Nicole herself is great: funny, kind, down to earth, and extremely helpful. Nicole was good at commuting before and during the trip. She made me feel welcome and helped me to find great places to go around Seattle. She\\'s a chef and is well connected to the \"foodie\" scene, so has a lot to say if you\\'re interested in finding great spots to eat -- everything from food trucks to french bakeries. This was the perfect traveling experience for me. I highly recommend Nicole\\'s place to anyone! My experience with Nicole was excellent because although she is super busy working in her home she displayed a real sense of calm.  I think what makes her unique is that she\\'s worked with many many people in a multitude of situations.\\r\\nWe did get to have a few moments to talk about some shared interests which  given both our schedules was nice. The neighborhood is a quiet residential one so getting a quiet night of sleep is easy.  Nicole does have a small dog, Louis who is an ambassador  par excellence.  He makes anyone feel welcomed and accepted into the household.   My experience with Nicole was excellent.  The room is private with a private bathroom and is on a beautiful patio.  I understand that future guests will have an even nicer arrangement since Nicole is planning to renovate the bathroom.  The property itself is situated on a super pleasant and quiet street within walking distance of shops and restaurants.  Nicole herself is a highly accomplished and experienced person who is very friendly, easy to talk to and extremely forthcoming with advice on where to eat and what to do in Seattle.  She\\'ll even advise you on other stuff like real estate and how the area compares to other places.  I hope to go back soon! Nicole was a gracious host. She had put a bottle of sparkling water in the little kitchenette fridge as well as a bar of chocolate and some fruit in the room.  The room and bathroom were private, clean, and comfortable.  The patio was a nice place to relax after a busy day.  Nicole has a very sweet dog who will come and visit you if you let him.  I found the neighborhood to be pleasant and safe.  For those using public transport there is a bus stop about two blocks away where you can catch a bus to downtown.  Overall, I had a very positive experience. I had a GREAT stay. My room was REALLY nice. I enjoyed my visits with Nicole and Louie. Will do it again next year. \\r\\nThank you for helping to make my stay a GREAT ONE. Sharon This 6 night visit was my first experience with this sort of accommodation - AirBnb or any other - and I learned a few things: photos don\\'t necessarily represent a part of the house that is available to the visitor; prior to booking ask more questions about amenities; book a room that has its own heat controls and thermostat; try to find out the details of the accommodations before booking.  I say this because though I was provided with a ceramic bowl, I was disappointed that the utensils and the 4\" plates were plastic. I had to ask for a mug which was promptly delivered with a glass as well.  I provided my own flatware.  The food area was dusty but the bedroom and bath felt clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nNicole was easy to communicate with by email during the online booking and in answering a few questions prior to my arrival.  I was out of the townhouse from about 9-9 every day.  Other than the initial brief introduction our paths did not cross.  I had a problem with the heat coming on too often during the first night.  I texted Nicole about it but she didn\\'t respond for 3 days.  Perhaps I should have telephoned though it wasn\\'t as bad after the first night.  The room is on the bottom of 3 floors of a townhouse and is next to the garage.  The heat all goes up of course.  If I kept the bedroom door (which opens to the hallway) closed the room was comfortable.  The hallway has the microwave and the apartment refrigerator, the front door, the stairs that lead up, and the door to the garage.  It was always very chilly.  The room is small but the twin bed was very comfortable.  The attached private bath was very nice.  I didn\\'t spend time in the patio area.  Street parking after 9 pm almost filled up.  It\\'s a nicely quiet location for sleeping.   This was my first experience with Airbnb so I was a bit apprehensive. But my stay at Nicole\\'s was great. Even though it was late when I arrived Nicole was there to greet me. The space is perfect for one person with a bedroom, bath and a patio out the back. Everything was neat and clean with no surprises!  The neighborhood is safe and  quiet. It was a convenient place for me as my daughter lives in Ballard. Much easier than being downtown.  I will certainly stay at Nicole\\'s during my next visit to Seattle! Thanks, Nicole! I had a great time staying in Nicole\\'s downstairs bedroom. It was very private and a small desk allowed me to work and make phone calls. The house is a quick walk to a couple of neighborhood bars and a brunch place with great crepes. An extended walk would get you to downtown Ballard with a much wider selection of dining and amusement venues. \\r\\nOh, the microwave, fridge and coffeemaker were great to have on hand! My stay was wonderful. My room was nice and warm. Love the visits from Louie every morning and when I got home. Nicki is a wonderful hostess.  One of the best Airbnbs we\\'ve ever stayed in! The neighborhood is incredible, exactly where we would want to live if we moved to Seattle! The home was so inviting, and the check in process was so easy. Highly recommended!! 일단 집은 매우 깨끗하고 정돈되어 있으며 마음에 들었다. 하지만 집 찾기가 쉽지 않았으며, 주소가 구글에서 찾을수 있는 주소였으면 좋겠다. \\r\\n사진에 나와있는 집은 301번지 이며 내가 찾고자 했던 집은 302번지 사진뒷집 이어서 밤에 찾아다녀야 했다. 그외엔 만족스러웠으며  10월 마지막주 밤엔 추운데 전기 스토브가 하나밖에 없어 한방은 이불속에 웅크려잤다. 마크와 브라이언은 만나지 못했다.  We had a great stay at Bryan & Mark\\'s place! Bryan is a great host - very welcoming, easy going and insightful. He brought extra fire bricks and a multi-usb charger after he saw we probably have a bunch of electronic devices with us :) The stay was great, the beds soo very comfortable. The home is very nice and cosy, and you\\'ll feel right at home the moment you enter. Highly recommended! We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Ballard Sunset View. They were not kidding about the view through the living room windows! We told our hosts we were bringing our daughter and were so thankful to find a pack n play at the house waiting for us after getting in so late from our flight. That really started our trip off nicely, being accommodated to so well. The house and surrounding area are very quiet (almost too quiet for our two year old). The location was great. We had everything we needed in the kitchen, the most comfortable bed ever, and the heater worked great and quick! I highly recommend this house if you\\'re looking to relax. Sound transfer between the first and second story seemed to be our only issue (the upstairs neighbor hearing us and vice versa). Bryan was great with communicating with us and we all left happy! This stay was exactly as described, and perfect. Cozy, private, and with an unexpectedly great view of the Olympics (on the one day it was clear)! \\r\\n \\r\\nI really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely head back on another Seattle visit. Hosts had great communication and made our stay perfect.  Excellent experience, house was perfect and the location was great! Would definitely stay here again. We had a wonderful stay at Mark and Bryan\\'s! The place was very clean with everything we needed to be comfortable! The location is also hard to beat... Very close to downtown Ballard, Queen Anne and downtown! The parking spot was very nice as well! We were traveling with two toddlers so the two bedrooms were nice for them to nap and sleep in, while my husband and I could enjoy ourselves in the living room and kitchen. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle!  The accommodations were perfect for what we needed and everything was readily available. Mark and Bryan were super responsive and made sure we had everything we needed. I would recommend this place to future travelers.  Bryan and Mark made us feel very welcomed. We had a total of 4 guests and the amenities are perfect for our group size. The beds were comfortable and the interior was very charming. Overall, a pleasant experience with great communication between them and I. Will repeat again. Very spacious flat with comfortable beds. Loved the fireplace! Bryan and Mark were wonderful hosts and very communicative. Thank you for the great stay!  I loved this apartment. It is quite spacious and very clean. I am familiar with the neighborhood because I have family only one block away. The covered parking kept us dry and I really enjoyed the fantastic view from the living room. I did not have time to use the fireplace. The beds were comfy and the bath exceptionally clean. \\r\\n   Mark and Bryan and were excellent hosts and emailed me numerous times to make sure that my stay was perfect. In the kitchen were all the items one could need including ice cream in the frig ! \\r\\n   I plan to use this apartment in the future. We had a wonderful stay for 5 nights, the apartment was extremely well furnished, it looks and feels better in person than in the photos.  The walls had wonderful artwork, and the kitchen was well stocked.  Beds were very comfy, great neighborhood, great everything, best deal in Seattle! Steven was an excellent host. He shared all information I needed early and offered his help and advice if I needed anything else. His house, the bedroom, and bathroom were all clean and comfortable. Great place, would be happy to stay there again. The listing is very accurate.  The room and bathroom are right near the entrance to the house that you see in the photos, and have a lot of privacy from the rest of the house.  The room is small but very nice, with a huge closet.  The house is extremely clean!  The dog is beautiful and so sweet.  Steven was very prompt at responding to all communication and was very flexible on check in and check out.  The neighbourhood is a very safe and nice area, not far to walk to restaurants, pubs, and grocery stores.  Several bus routes are within short walking distance too.   Very nice place, great neighborhood. Wish I had had more time to spend here. Very modern place. Steven was accommodating and understanding of my constantly changing schedule and even made time for me after my stay when I had forgotten something. Great host, great place, cute dog too! This house is in a great location and Steven is an excellent host.  The place is very clean and has all you could need. Steven went out of his way to ensure I had what I needed; he vent supplied a iron and ironing board. He has a great dog that is very friendly; and not a bother at all. I highly recommend Steven and this listing.  My husband and I had a most enjoyable stay. Everything was ready for us when we arrived in this lovely neighborhood. Steven was a truly gracious host and sharing his home was perfect for us. I was having a surgery done at Swedish and this provided a close in respite for us. The neighborhood park was just what our dog needed too. We would stay with \\r\\nSteven again when we need to be in the city.\\r\\nThank you Steven, it was perfect!\\r\\nChristine & David Great location in Ballard. Nice, very clean bedroom and bathroom. I wasn\\'t around much, but Steven was very helpful. Steven was very  welcoming and available to while honoring personal privacy. The space was better than advertised, clean, comfortable, had unexpected extras (large flat screen TV, full pot of coffee in the am), and in a great location for visiting SPU. \\r\\nI\\'ll be back!\\r\\nThanks! Steven made sure the space was clean and welcoming, and had some extra coffee on every morning. I loved the great internet/tv access and the house is really beautiful with great facilities. Plus, dog cuddles! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was not far from services/grocery etc, and an easy walking distance to a number of bus routes which was helpful for me as I wasn\\'t driving while in town. \\r\\n\\r\\nI appreciated the privacy of having the bedroom and bathroom on their own level too. I tend to keep to myself when I travel to rest up so it was nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlexible check-in times were really helpful too, with a late flight arrival on my first day.  Steven was a great host. My partner and I stayed with him for 3 nights. The bed was extremely comfortable and Steven made everything very clear and was great about communicating. Thanks for a fantastic stay. Loved your house! Steven\\'s home is every bit as hospitable and inviting as his listing suggests.  The first floor bedroom is very comfortable, the private bathroom is very convenient, and the common areas are a great perk for moments when you need to just relax for a bit.  The location is a short walk from a bunch of great micro-breweries, and it\\'s not much farther to get to the hip spots in Ballard.  We walked almost everywhere, which was perfect.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSteven is a very accommodating host.  Everything worked perfectly, down to the personalized key code to enter the house.  He even made us coffee in the morning!  As far as shared living situations go, Steven was the perfect blend of hand-on when he needed to be, and hands-off when he wasn\\'t needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would highly recommend this location.  Go for it! Very nice, clean place. Good neighborhood with a lot of street parking.  My son and girlfriend really enjoyed the place that Steven had. He made them feel comfortable and really helped getting familiar with Seattle. great location and great host. Would definitely recommend! The bedroom was cozy, and being on the first floor was quiet and private. Steven was easily accessible when we had questions. Tug is a sweet, sweet pup. Great place to stay if you enjoy the Ballard neighborhood.  Highly recommended.  Steven was a great host & made everything super easy.  The listing is accurate & he keeps the place very clean.  His dog, Tug, is also awesome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is close to downtown, to public transportation & quiet. Steven was very accommodating and we enjoyed staying with him. He has a lovely dog that I enjoyed playing with as well.  Steven was really accommodating during my stay. It was a last minute request and he was able to go out of his way to fit me in so I had a place to stay for the night! It was nice to have a whole floor to myself...my stay felt so luxurious! The bedroom and bathroom were really nice and the TV was huge!! I was able to relax in bed watching modern family on HuluPlus :) the bed was super comfortable as well. Steven was an amazing host...chill, relatable, and friendly. I would definitely stay here again!  Steven oli loistava isäntä. Asunto oli todella siisti ja sänky oli erittäin mukava. Asunnon sijainti oli kätevä sillä sieltä oli helppo kävellä mm. Ballardin ja Freemontin alueille, kuin myös bussipysäkeille. Über -kyyti Downtowniin maksoi n. 12$\\r\\n\\r\\nSteven loi meille oman ovikoodin ja wifin ja antoi hyviä neuvoja siitä, mitä kannattaa tehdä. Huippumesta! Great place and model of hospitality.  Perfect location for restaurants and bars in Ballard.   Steven\\'s place was awesome. Very clean, great neighborhood, would definitely stay again hands down. Steve had everything down to a T. I felt like I was staying at a luxury suite or something it was perfect. Didn\\'t want to leave.  Steven has a great pad in a wonderful part of Seattle, convenient to almost everything it felt.  He was really easy to communicate about arrival time and the room in quaint and very comfortable.  Bonus... the awesome dog that also lives here.  I will definitely be making a return stay here when I can. Great house, great host, great location. Steve provided a clean room with extras including coffee, a great patio and tons of information about the city. The house is walking distance to several local breweries in a very cool neighborhood. Thanks for the great stay! Steven was an excellent host. He was very accommodating and helpful. The house is lovely and should have everything you need for your stay. You\\'ll also have delicious coffee and fresh eggs from his hens! Tug, his dog, is friendly and very cute, but if you\\'re not a dog person he\\'s very quiet and shouldn\\'t bother you. The townhome is about a 15 min walk to downtown Ballard or Freemont, but you\\'ll need to drive/Uber to most other places.  Steven has a very nice and modern house in a lovely neighbourhood in Seattle. He helped a lot when we had questions or wanted to know things. The room and bathroom is like on the pictures: very comfortable and modern! From Stevens house, you could very easy come into town with public transportation.  So all in all, we would definitely recommend to stay in Stevens house! I loved my stay at Steven\\'s great house in Ballard! It was great to be in a real neighborhood with character instead of in a boring hotel. Space was clean and pleasant, and parking was plentiful. Plus, there were tons of great breweries, food carts and restaurants a short walk away. Steven made it really easy to access the space and made us feel very welcome. Will definitely try to book this place again on my next visit to Seattle. Steven was a great host, model of hospitality. The place had everything we needed, coffee was ready in the mornings, and Tug, the pup was super sweet. Perfect location for restaurants and bars in Ballard. Good stay at Steven\\'s house. The home was comfortable, and it was great to be able to lounge in the upstairs living room and make use of the nice kitchen.  We enjoyed walking around and exploring Ballard. Everything was close by. Parking was easy. Steven was working most of the time, but was very responsive via texting and e-mail. would recommend tony friends. Staying at Steven\\'s Modern Townhouse with my very own private floor was a truly top notch Air BnB experience. He had everything customized just for my stay - from the wifi with my own name on it, to the custom four digit lock code that was the last four digits of my personal cell number, Steven went to great lengths to ensure that my stay was as comfortable and easy as possible. It was the first air BnB i stayed at that wasn\\'t completely detached from the hosts main living spaces, but Steven was super gracious and gave me the space when I needed it, but was more than happy to let me sit down and watch ESPN with him over a glass of wine. And his awesome dog, Tug was a pleasant surprise too. If you\\'re looking for a place with hotel-like service, then this is definitely the one you\\'re looking for! Great location!!. Very hospitable hosts. Very friendly greater (dog). \\nWould stay there again anytime!  Steven\\'s townhouse was just as it looked: newish and very comfortable and clean. The bathroom was nice too and completely private.  Getting in and out was easy via a coded lock - no key needed.  The neighborhood is very quiet, and everything you might need is within walking distance: breakfast, lunch, and dinner restaurants, and many microbrew pubs. I took the bus line to downtown for $3.00.  Steven was a nice host - he provides lots of recommendations on where to eat locally, and what to see - as was his dog Tug, who I took for a walk. This was a great way to get to know a part of Seattle that I never would have visited.  Staying at Steven\\'s place was amazing. The house is super clean and beautiful! Steven went out of his was to be accommodating and provide suggestions as to what to see and places to eat and drink. Plus Tug(the dog) is a blast! Super cute with a lot of energy. I\\'m glad my first Airbnb experience was here. Would definitely stay at Steven\\'s place in a heartbeat again! Steven was very responsive with texts and e-mails as we got close to the date of our arrival.  He made sure everything was ready for us on arrival, and we found the accommodations very comfortable and as advertised.  Even though we were only there for one night, we were able to easily access the house and our accommodations and found the location very convenient for our visit. Awesome house in a great part of Seattle.  Super close walk to the interesting Ballard area, and an easy drive or bus ride downtown.  Steven was great. I\\'d recommend this listing to anyone visiting Seattle! Though we only visited one night Stevens house is a great place to explore Seattle from. A bus stop that will take you downtown is only a few blocks away. We followed his recommendation and had breakfast  at The Dish. A delicious and cozy little place.  An overall great experience. Great place! Location was easy to get to, and still close to downtown. Parking was no problem, and the house was nice and clean. The bed was also super-comfortable. Steven made sure my girlfriend and I knew everything we needed to for check-in, check-out, and getting around the house. Him and his hilarious golden doodle were most welcoming! Would definitely stay again! This was my first experience with airbnb and i\\'m happy to say it went great. Steven was very welcoming and his dog Tug was awesome. The apartment was on a pretty quiet street in Ballard but close enough to everything. My bedroom and bathroom were both cozy and clean! I would definitely stay here again. Steven makes it very easy on setting up codes and passwords for coming in and out ,internet, and cable. Wish i could have stayed longer!  \\r\\nMy stay at Steven\\'s house was very nice and quite comfortable.  My cozy bedroom was just the right size for me and had a sizable closet for all my stuff; plenty of room altogether.  My private bathroom down the hall was spectacular.  The neighborhood was delightful and friendly.  I rode my bike through it feeling quite safe.  The perfect spot for us to visit relatives in Seattle for a few days. Steven was gracious and helpful. Thanks for the excellent stay! The place is very nice and clean with 2 great breweries within 2 blocks of his house!  The room is on the smaller side but was very clean and had a big TV mounted on the wall so you can easily hang out on your own if you want.  Steve is a really nice guy and although we didn\\'t see much of each other he was pretty easy going and even made coffee the first morning I was there!\\r\\n\\r\\nWould definitely go back. I like the fully automated checkin/checkout process which made ti very easy to arrive at any time.  Steven\\'s house is very well appointed and just as described.  I found it perfect for my visit to Seattle. Steven made me feel welcome with keeping things simple for me with the door code and wifi password.  The neighborhood was quiet and close to amenities.  The house is clean and Tug is adorable and well behaved.  Overall, a positive experience! Steven was a great host and made our stay super easy. Easy instructions on how to come and go from the condo and the downstairs unit was very private so it felt like having an apartment to ourselves. The Ballard area was perfect for great restaurants and exploring the city both on foot and an easy drive to popular sites downtown.  Steven\\'s Airbnb was a restful retreat--enjoyed the downstairs suite and small garden area. I also used the kitchen on the main floor to heat water for tea and eat meals in a clean and contemporary space. Steven is a gracious, responsive and accommodating host! Steve was very welcoming and even ran  home in the middle of his work day to be certain the space was in good order.  He also responded quickly to all of our inquiries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood was safe and quiet and within walking distance to the Ballard business district where we discovered several wonderful restaurants.  On a chilly, rainy Seattle afternoon we found refuge at the Majestic Movie Theater and enjoyed the BIG screen experience!\\r\\n\\r\\n Steven\\'s home was super clean and tastefully decorated.  We appreciated his detailed instructions and suggestions for local restaurants and activities. Communication was easy, too. Steven\\'s place im Seattle\\'s hip Ballard neighborhood was ideal! His dog, \"Tug\", is very cute & welcoming as well.... Walking distance to several great micro brewery\\'s - One of the most relaxing airbnb experiences i\\'ve had... You really have your own entire floor to yourself, with access to the other floors if needed-- I\\'d stay here again in a heartbeat! Easy to find. Quiet and comfortable. Did not meet Steven, but he was responsive and easy to work with prior to my stay. Thanks for providing recommendations for places to eat - I really enjoyed trying a new place for breakfast (loved the food, service and setting of the Dish). We had a great time! Nice and clean, exactly as it was listed, and the pup Tug made for a great new friend! Steven was even kind enough to get the coffee brewing for us late-ish sleepers. The house is close to a lot of local breweries and stylish restaurants, ensuring that neither the foodie nor the beer-lover will go wanting if they stay here. Highly recommend this place and its awesome host! A hidden jewel of an airbnb located in the pleasant Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, Steven\\'s place is quite charming & relaxing. This was the 2nd time in 2 weeks that i stayed here and, as with the 1st time , i give it 5 stars~  This was my first airbnb experience.  I was a little nervous about being a stranger in someone else\\'s house but Steven made the experience comfortable and easy.  I was out and about most the time so only interacted with Steven once but he was very welcoming and his dog Tug gives excellent hugs.  The neighborhood is great.  I rented a car and found that I was an easy 10-15 min away from everything I wanted to see.  I did a lot of yoga around Ballard, Fremont and Queen Anne.  All the studios were excellent.  Coffee shops in all those neighborhoods are cozy and tasty as well.  It was great having a comfortable place to come home to each night.  Not having to bother with a key was excellent!     Our stay at the caboose was perfect! Super clean and a nice area in Ballard. Parking was super simple each day and Jennifer and her family were kind and attentive! Thanks and hope we get to stay again!  This little caboose apartment is a great place to stay while in Seattle. Jennifer and David are perfect hosts and have made the caboose comfortable and homey. The neighborhood is quiet with mountains in the distance and restaurants and shops nearby. I look forward to a return visit to this inviting space.  Jennifer and her family were great hosts, very communicative and warm. We felt at home with our two small children. Jennifer even bought an iron for the space at our request! They live in a great neighborhood in Seattle, great  for walking around and close to many restaurants and other amenities. The house was exactly as advertised, and was a great place to stay for an overnight in Ballard. The private bedroom and bathroom were extremely clean and cozy. Communication with India was prompt and friendly. She was generous and accommodating when we asked to borrow an iron and hairdryer. It was about a 15 minute walk to the nice shopping and eating zone on Market St. All in all,  if you\\'re keen on the Ballard area, I\\'d recommend staying here!\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes on getting around: it\\'s about a $20-25 cab ride downtown to the bus station. If you use car2go, we found that there weren\\'t many available nearby. I had a wonderful stay at India\\'s house. She met me for check-in and did a great job of explaining the house as well as pointing me in the right direction to local coffee shops, restaurants, and bus line. The room is large with lots of natural light and a very comfortable bed! The house is and yard were well maintained. I enjoyed being in the Ballard neighborhood. Setting up a meeting time with India was very easy. Great host and great house!  I reached India in the morning needing a place for one night. She got backed to quickly. We had a very pleasant stay and would highly recommend her place. India\\'s house is so warm and cozy! The upstairs guest room has a nice bathroom and work space. She left out coffee and all the instructions we needed. The area is super central but quiet enough to relax!  Quick response from India when we contacted her with questions. \\r\\nIt was a charming house in a quiet neighborhood and we enjoyed our stay.   India is a fantastic hostess. She kept in contact with us right until arrival, insuring she would be home to greet us and help with directions if needed. Once we arrived, India gave us a tour, showed us our room (which was VERY large), our bathroom, where the amenities were, and even brought us two glasses of water. \\r\\n\\r\\nHer listing is entirely acurrate. If anything, the space is larger than described and the bed is very comfortable. \\r\\n\\r\\nHer home is located in the best neighborhood in Seattle (Ballard). and is very close to easy public transit and Ballard Ave. Home of the best restaurants in the city.  The host India was very nice and accomodating although I couldn\\'t have a chance to meet her. She was very organized explaining how to use her house and there was no hassle to use it. The room looked same as the picture and cozy. As advertised, the whole second floor was for guests, so that we could easily make ourself at home. The area there was a little bit far from downtown by public transportation but managable; bicycles and car2go can be a perfect substitute.  India was amazing! We booked our stay with one days notice and India responded within 5 minutes. This was our first airbnb experience and it was surprisingly easy. The space was as advertised and looks exactly like the pictures. Location was awesome. Ballard and Fremont are only minutes away.  The room was comfortable, clean and well lit. After a week of traveling all over Seattle and the Olympic Peninsula India\\'s rental was a nice, peaceful space to relax and renew. Highly recommend to future travelers in the Seattle area. Very clean place in lovely Ballard. It was nice to have a back entrance very private feeling and to have parking on the street.  Lovely neighbourhood with some excellent food and shops nearby. The room was quiet and warm and well set up. We really enjoyed our stay! This is a very comfortable spot, private bath with large bedroom. Entrance in the back door and right up the stairs. The directions were great. We did not have the pleasure of meeting India, she was at a workshop but great communication and will be back for sure.  India was very welcoming and made sure we could get into her space at the time we wanted. The upstairs rooms were spacious, bright, clean, and felt very homey. The neighborhood is quiet with the old Ballard feel. We appreciated the hospitality and certainly would come again.  What a lovely, comfortable home in a great Seattle neighborhood. India was away during our stay but the mark of her family life made the place seem homey and welcoming.  Everything was spic and span and well laid out. It\\'s near two other wonderful  Seattle  neighborhoods--Freemont and Greenlake, and,best of all,  near my daughter and her family. Highly recommended. India has a wonderful home and we felt very comfortable during our stay.  Would definitely stay here again. We didn\\'t get to meet India during our stay, but her place was great! It was clean and just like the photos. It\\'s also close to shopping and restaurants in Ballard and Tremont and the neighborhood coffee shop (Slate) is right around the corner. Would definitely stay here again! We felt at home right away. It\\'s a very comfortable space to explore Seattle from. India is a good host.  India was amazing -- friendly, very responsive, and had great local recommendations. Room was super clean, had a large comfortable bed, offered lots of privacy and in a great location! India was a great host and the room looks just like on the pics. All was perfect! It\\'s a quite calm residential area, but a bus to downtown is easy to catch close to the house. India did a great job of providing a clean, relaxing, and enjoyable space for us to stay. We were thoroughly impressed by the cleanliness of the place and we definitely appreciated the privacy and space afforded by having the upstairs to ourselves. The place itself was really beautiful and well decorated. We really fell in love with the neighborhood - it was quiet and had lots of really nice homes and landscaping. And it still felt pretty close to the city. Lots of good food and drink in the area as well.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough we didn\\'t get to talk much in person during our stay, India was great at communicating through AirBnB and answered all our questions promptly. We had no trouble checking in, even though our train arrived late in the night. She was even kind enough to accommodate us leaving our stuff at the place until closer to our departure time on the last day.  We had a very pleasant stay at India\\'s place. We found both room and the whole upstairs quarters that she offers her guests to be clean and comfortable and India herself polite and helpful. Checkin and checkout were easy and the location in Ballard is great. India was very responsive to my inquiries. The location was quite walkable. The accommodations were clean and cheery.  I would certainly recommend it! India\\'s place was perfect for our short visit to Seattle. It was accurately reflected in her post.  The listing was very accurate.  The house was charming, clean and comfortable.  Having the second floor to ourselves made the experience feel very private.  Great neighborhood with plenty of street parking.  India consistently responded promptly and provided helpful tips on local restaurants.  I would stay here again. Place was great. Shawn was very accommodating. Trailer was clean. Great location.  My short stay at Shawn\\'s was fantastic. The space was well maintained, everything I needed was provided and Shawn was incredibly friendly. Also, the location is awesome. I\\'ll definitely be back. Shawn was very helpful, and a great communicator. The trailer was clean and lovely, as well as a great place to stay after the Fremont fair.  The mattress was surprisingly comfortable, and I slept well. Shawn was an awesome host and very helpful. The El Ray was so cosy and clean. Just exactly what we were looking for. \\nThe busstation was just a few minutes away, so we could reach Downtown quickly. Also the neighboorhood was great, we felt safe all the time.\\nWe highly recommend it! Shawn was rad and so was the El Ray! I will most definitely be back! Shawn was a great host, and we loved the airstream. Compact, but plenty of storage space, etc. Shower was on the fritz, but he let us use the one in his house so no worries. Great location, quiet, but close to action in Ballard/Fremont. Definitely recommend.  Shawn is a relaxed and gracious host. The El Rey is clean, comfortable and adorable. It is \"tip top\". The neighborhood is one of the best in Seattle and close to about everything. I have found the perfect little place to stay when in town.  This was glamping at its finest. We wish we could of spent more time in Seattle. The El Rey is a pretty awesome to stay at if you are passing through Seattle. Shawn was awesome for waiting up late for us, and making sure we were all settled in. We\\'ll definitely want to stay again next time we are in Seattle.  Shawn was great! My husband and I were road tripping across the west and knew we wanted to stay in Seattle. We came across this unique opportunity and are so glad it worked out. Shawn is an artist! His backyard was beautifully designed. The El Rey was fantastic! It\\'s super clean and cozy. Loved the shower! Shawn took the time to give us some ideas for dining and entertainment. We were able to walk a few blocks for local food and yummy bourbon! Overall this was definitely a highlight of our trip. Shawn and the El Rey are now a wonderful part of our story.  Nice, relaxing, good (email hidden)rst time using the airbnb system.  The El Rey camper was a delight to stay in, once I familiarized myself with everything.  It was clean, the bed was comfortable, the little bathroom was just like a camper - and totally fine and functional.  The shower was awesome - good water temp and pressure.  Sweet backyard, quiet neighborhood.   \\r\\nI didn\\'t meet Shawn in person but spoke to him on the phone a few times with questions about the camper, wifi, orientation, etc.\\r\\nI would have appreciated printouts of a neighborhood map, and the El Rey\\'s Guidebook, esp. when locking the camper door (which I never figured out on account of a sticky lock.  I couldn\\'t get wifi in the camper during my stay there - my iphone couldn\\'t detect it, though Shawn said it was available. Maybe the router is not close enough?  \\r\\nNevertheless..  those are not big problems.  I didn\\'t have a car, and rented a bike to get around the Freemont and Ballard (Frelard! Now I get it!!) and absolutely loved the area. The camper was a nice thing to \"call home\" for a few days.  Coffee supplied, but I wanted to get on my bike and go find another Seattle café for a great Americano.  Excellent restaurants in both neighborhoods, loved the bike trail, loved finding the beach on the bike, and ripe blackberries along the trail.   Shawn\\'s description was very accurate. The trailer was very clean and was just the thing we needed as a home base while visiting in Seattle. The trailer is located in a private back yard behind his house with access through a side gate. It\\'s located only a few houses over from a busy street but inside the trailer it was very quiet. Thanks Shawn! We had a wonderful stay at the El Rey! Shawn is a great host, very friendly and helpful without being at all intrusive. The el Rey was spotless when we arrived. We had a great nights rest on the comfy pull out bed. Shawn also helped us fit our portable crib for our son inside as well. We loved the location- We took a short drives to both Freemont and Ballard. Shawn also gave us great recommendations for camping in Olympic National Park. High recommend! My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at the El Rey. Shawn was extremely easy to communicate with and recommended a breakfast spot that was right up our alley (Beth\\'s). I kind of wanted to hang out with him more than the friends I was in town to see. The El Rey itself is charming inside and out. All of the amenities are neatly tucked away in the compact yet comfortable cabin. I had a great night\\'s rest and would stay here again in a heartbeat. Everyone feels like a king in the El Rey.  Staying at the El Ray was an awesome experience. Shawn was a great host who was super accommodating and easy-going. He can provide you with some great local recommendations to help you discover the area. \\n\\nIf you\\'re planning to check out the Ballard/Fremont area be sure to make your base the El Ray.  The El Ray was a fantastic place to stay. We truly enjoyed it and can really recommend it.\\nWe did not meet our host, but he made sure everything worked superfine anyway. Will definately stay there again next time we visit Seattle. Very nice experience! The El Rey is great and comfortable. Nice quite area. All perfectly as listed! Shawn and friends are very nice and welcoming.\\r\\nRecommended!! One of the coolest airbnb experiences \\nClean. Comfortable. Great host We stayed in this property for two nights at the end of our US road trip and it was perfectly adequate. This is an inexpensive place to stay but is very clean and comfortable and is located close to some really nice parts of Seattle and also very close to bus routes to downtown. There is also an oven and big fridge which is awesome. Shawn was kind and showed his neighborhood hospitality. We walked down to the local Chinese restaurant.   Easy and smooth booking! The El Ray is an awesome camper in a cool neighborhood. Fremont and Ballard are within walking distance, but it\\'s about a mile either way. Shawn wasn\\'t around, but his really nice friend checked us in and showed us around. \\r\\n\\r\\nLike other reviews, wifi is spotty, but that shouldn\\'t be a priority. The resident kitty, Willy was really friendly and came by to say hi a few times. The shower temperature was \"hot\" and very enjoyable. We will definitely stay again!  Shawn went out of his way to make us feel at home and to ensure we made the most out of our short trip to Seattle. The location was perfect for us. We\\'ll definitely be back!  Shawn was very pleasant and accommodating. When we had to unexpectedly change our plans he allowed us to adjust our length of stay from 2 nights to 1 with no problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe El Rey was as advertised. Clean and compact. All amenities worked: shower, toilet, sink, etc. This was a good experience. First of all, I love his \"Instant Book\" feature. Saves a lot of time from going back and forth. Second, he made it easy for us to check-in without him there. I loved the El Rey. A really cool and unique Air Bnb experience. The pictures are 100% exact. It\\'s definitely big enough for 2 and the bed comes out to be surprisingly kind of big. He has a book full of places and things to do in the area. Really helpful. Had the pleasure of meeting him the next morning. Super chill and made sure we had a good time. Location is good. A few restaurants/bars and breweries nearby and if you don\\'t mind walking a mile, downtown Ballard is there too. The \"El Rey\"was cozy and tidy. Shawn helped us get settled when we arrived. We enjoyed our stay, the bed was comfortable  We did not cook anything but refrigerator kept things cold The El Rey is quite an icon. Lots of character. What you see is what you get: a no frills camper at a great price. Managed to get a hot shower despite the expectation it wouldn\\'t. Enjoyed it a lot. Shawn is a welcoming and relaxed guy. Engaging but never intrusive. The El Rey is very cool, comfortable, and clean. Shawn was very hospitable. I would highly recommend staying here.  What wonderful world indeed. We were legitimately sad to leave and staying in El Rey was the highlight of our trip!! El Rey itself was perfect and Shawn is magically fantastic to say the least. Their location is walking distance to tons of great food/drink and public transport to downtown and surrounding areas was a piece of cake. We will absolutely stay here again and can\\'t wait to get back to Seattle -thank you Shawn (Jango and Milly too!) for such an awesome time!! A fresh experience staying at El Rey – a great combination of urban and wild living styles. The RV is very clean and the bed is extremely comfortable than we expected. It also parks at a beautiful yard with a modern fence designed by Shawn.  He is also a very friendly host who speaks gently. I especially like the booklet he prepared which tells you what to visit and good restaurants nearby.  The only small drawback is that the street was a bit busy at night, but not a problem once you falling into sleep. El Rey was a dreamy oasis in a bustling but calm area. Close enough to downtown Seattle for the convenience and value, but far enough for a quiet escape. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe trailer was clean, spacious, and well-stocked. The bed easily + comfortably slept 2 grown-ups. The bright decor and  amenities made El Rey feel like home. \\r\\n\\r\\nShawn was the perfect host. He was available to show us around and help us get settled, but also gave us space when we needed some rest. Shawn is a great person to talk to -- intelligent, conscientious, and full of amazing tales. He also knows a lot about the local marijuana industry if you\\'re into that kind of thing. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall El Rey exceeded our expectations. Looking for a crash pad for the night, we discovered a cozy, comfortable, and charming gem.  Super cool to stay in an airstream! would\\'ve wanted to stay longer and Shawn was a friendly host, thanks for having us! Shawn was a great host! He has a lot of good neighborhood recommendations and was super hospitable. We really enjoyed our unique experience staying in the airstream and would for sure come back! Fantastic! What a cozy little place. The El Rey was a great home base for our trip to Seattle. There were two of us staying, so we were worried about space, especially since we were coming in for a wedding and needed to bring nice clothes. But we managed quite well - and the El Rey is set up efficiently. It\\'s definitely snug, but the bed opens up to be quite spacious, and there\\'s  plenty of space to store things, move around, hang out, etc. Shawn was a great host and answered any questions we had immediately. He also got us a steamer for our clothes, which was clutch!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only word of warning we\\'d give is that you should stay with someone you\\'re quite comfortable with, as the bathroom doesn\\'t offer much privacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut overall, it was a very fun, unique place to call home for a few days and felt like a glamorous way to camp in the city. We would definitely stay here again. The location is great and close to a lot of great restaurants. We had a car and the street parking was incredibly easy and free. Staying in El Rey was a really great experience. Shawn was nice, and helpful when we needed it. There\\'s plenty of privacy, it\\'s just enough room for two  the camper is very clean and modern looking, with small toiletries that you might forget, like lotion and shampoo! This was our first AirBnB experience, and it was awesome! We were lucky to have Shawn as our host. He even contacted us when we left a few small items behind, and offered to shop them to us for free. Thanks again to Shawn and AirBnB :)  The El Rey was fabulous!  Everything was just as described. The sleeping accommodations were perfect for two and the bathroom/kitchen had everything we needed.  We especially appreciated the coffee and   french press.  \\n\\nWe had a terrific time visiting Seattle and hope to be back soon.  We\\'d love to stay at the El Rey again and would recommend it to anyone we know who wants a fun place to stay in Seattle.  \\n\\nThanks again! El Rey is accurately described as \"glamping.\" A nicely renovated interior space with room for two. There are plenty of small touches which Shawn has put into the camper to make it feel homey. Located between great neighborhoods (Fremont & Ballard); it\\'s worth staying here, a few minutes drive away from downtown Seattle. Shawn was accessible and quick to respond via text. Great spot for an overnight, decent space for a weekend stay.  Great place! This is such a fun camper experience - and it\\'s walking distance to some great restaurants. It\\'s very quiet and really nice backyard area for hanging outside. There is also a heater if it\\'s cold that works well inside. Thanks, Shawn :)  If you\\'re reading this review, you must be on the fence about the El Rey in Frelard.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me just say: you would be missing all of the fun, if you do not camp out in Shawn\\'s backyard. Six out of a possible five stars. Top notch. This is what happens when Airbnb gets it right.   Shawn was an amazing host, totally friendly and welcoming! The El Rey was just as the pictures show, clean and comfy. Unique accommodation. The neighborhood was very easy to navigate and the info in his guestbook and the tips he gave us were great. Easy to get to with public transport from the airport and downtown. Would definitely do it again, thanks Shawn! nice decorations inside El Ray,  you can walk to cool cafes/bars, comfortable stay...Shawn was a super kind and great host!!! Sean was very welcoming and did his best to prepare the trailer before we got there despite our unplanned early arrival. He’s a fine host and the El Rey is truly unique: a classic trailer with modern updates in a good location and at a extremely reasonable price. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was only one disappointment: the propane tanks ran out of fuel before we arrived, so there was no heat or warm water for our 1-night stay. This meant a chilly night and no shower. Sean was apologetic, and offered his home shower to us in the morning. Running out of fuel was an honest mistake for a new host, but I wish he’d offered some discount or compensation for the significant downgrade in the listing. Shawn was a perfect host. He was welcoming, helpful and pleasant. The El Ray looked just like it did in the pictures. It was super cute inside and there was plenty of room for all our stuff, including hanging all our wedding weekend outfits. We also spent time outside relaxing in the Adirondack chairs with a fire going. We truly enjoyed our stay. We especially loved the privacy or our \"own\" place. \\r\\nThe neighborhood was nice and quiet. There were good places within walking distance to eat that had food for most types --  burgers or vegetarian fare at the same places, a great breakfast joint, pizza, etc.. We took the bus once, which was easy, and we used Uber cabs most of the time, which were great. Very welcoming and accommodating host and had a great night\\'s sleep in the El Rey! Only wish I could have stayed longer. Oh yeah...had a hot (not warm) shower! Cheers! Everything we wanted it to be! Thanks Shawn! Staying at \"El Rey\" was a great experience. I arrived somewhat late, but Shaw was extremely accommodating. The room was comfortable, clean and modernized, complete with all you could hope for. If you are staying in Seattle, this makes for a fun experience out of what would otherwise be a boring hotel room. It\\'s quirky and colorful, plus it\\'s in close proximity to a number of restaurants and bars. And if you have any questions about which one of those to visit, Shawn has great suggestions. Shawn was the most charismatic, gracious host ever. A perfect 10 on the personality of the El Rey, Shawn himself and his trusty Milton the cat. 100% recommend. Good neighborhood, walking distance to some really great restaurants and bars. Shawn was a great host. He was very friendly and helped us with everything we needed. The El Rey was very clean, organized and practical. We would recommend Shawn and the El Rey to everyone who travels to Seattle. Shawn was there to greet us as soon as we arrived and was very friendly. The El Ray was awesome and exactly as described. Shower was definitely hot as long as you adjust the taps! The neighborhood was perfect especially if you like beer! Great places to eat, drink, relax, and only a $13 uber ride into downtown. Shawn was a very friendly host. Always available if we needed him. The El Rey is very sharming. We slept very well. Comfy bed, good bathroom with all amenities. Loved the place. We took the bus downtown and took us about 15 min and was just a 5min walk from his house. Perfect location. Quite neighbourhood. Would definitely recommend.  Nicest place in Seattle! Shawn was awesome. He was ready for us when we arrived and showed us the space. He responded quickly when we needed anything! The El Rey was just what we expected from the listing and we had a blast staying there. The neighborhood is beautiful and there are a lot of restaurants, boutiques and bars a short walk away. Definitely recommend if you\\'re looking for a simple base while you\\'re in Seattle. I\\'ve never stayed in a place like this so I didn\\'t know what to expect. Shawn was very accessible and accommodating.  The place is a trailer after all, so you feel every movement.  It was tastefully decorated (just like glamping) with amenities you need including adirondaks and fire pit outside.  My teenager daughter and I slept comfortably and our only wish was for stronger wifi inside the actual trailer.  But if you sat outside, it was great - but we\\'re Californian\\'s so it was a bit chilly for us even with the throw blankets he had ;).  Oh, no little shower mat so be careful coming out but the shower was hot enough, heaters and even french press with coffee beans/grinder.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocation was great - a quick 2 minute drive down to the hip Market street down Ballard but overall, you\\'re in a nice, treelined quiet neighborhood with ample street parking.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, it was welcomed surprise that didn\\'t throw me off on the idea of staying there again.  \\r\\n What a great experience to stay in an airstream trailer! Even thought we only got to talk to Shawn the last day we were there he was friendly and helpful. The place is what we expected as described in the listing.  Hope to come back to Seattle soon!  Shawn provided my first Air BnB experience. The accommodations were delightful. The airstream is equipped with all the modern amenities you could ask for but still holds that charming retro feel. Love his personalized touch of the guest book that answers any questions you may have and provides a list of nearby restaurants and attractions.   We had a great stay in the el rey, Shawn was really nice and helpful.  Highly recommended! Our stay at the El Rey is what makes Airbnb great. A unique experience in a fun city with a host that provides tons of recommendations and suggestions for a fun stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nShawn was a great host, quick to communicate and ease with giving us access to the El Rey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is great -- quiet, close to a lot of fun restaurants, brewpubs and bus stops. \\r\\n\\r\\nI couldn\\'t recommend The El Rey more. Great experience, I love that you dont have to bother the host as you have a stand alone room instead of it being in a shared living space. Shawn was great, he worked with me on my short stay, making it easy to check in and out despite my short notice. El Rey itself is awesome, well kept, practical and story worthy.  Just had a nice 1-night stay at the El Rey. Shawn offered good communication to coordinate our arrival. The trailer itself is small, but - it\\'s a trailer; was perfectly cozy for 2 people. Its re-habbed interior was clean and cute. Shawn had prepared a binder with lots of helpful info about the neighborhood, getting around town, a broad range of eating spots, and more. Neighborhood noise at night was minimal. A French press and ground coffee in the trailer\\'s tiny galley was welcomed in the morning, as was the shower, which offered plenty of hot water. Altogether it was a unique and comfortable (for what it is) place to stay, and a convenience in an otherwise almost hotel-free part of Seattle. Enjoyed staying here very much!  Had a great nights sleep on the pull out bed, and the space didn\\'t feel too cramped for my boyfriend and I.  Very cool place to stay in, and in a cool location and neighborhood. This was the perfect little location for us to stay. Easy and close parking. The place is perfectly stocked with necessities. Ideal for your self alone or a couple.  The description of the place was perfectly right, the neighborhood is great, and being at walking distance from Ballard avenue is nice too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe El Rey was perfectly romantic and well equipped.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe appreciated so much the coffee bean, the grinder, and the cafetière!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks,\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will be back soon! My sister and I stayed the night in the El Rey and it was great for what we needed. We wanted to explore a neighbourhood rather than stay downtown and had a fun night drinking and eating in Ballard area. Checking in and out was super casual and easy. The place was clean and the bed was cozy. We were hoping to google some restaurants and bars in the area as well as access maps but couldnt connect to the wifi unless we were outside close to the house- wouldnt have been a prob on a sunny day but it was raining whilst we were there. Bus from downtown was easy and super close.  Very cozy and convenient. Easy to locate from the bus stop and I was able to access the El Rey without anyone being home. There was a small fridge to put snacks and it was equipped to make coffee in the morning. The space was clean and organized. We loved our stay! The El Rey was so unique and cute! We also did the list of breweries provided by Shawn, which was very enjoyable. We would highly recommend. The bed was also very comfy and we felt at home. Nice place, great communication, fun location. Use a lighter to get the stove top working. If the gas heater is troublesome ask for the electric one. Sometimes the toilet handle sticks open, just push it back. The El Ray was a great home away from home. Simple, clean and conveniently located. We had no problem getting in and out. The bed was comfy and the heater worked great during the cold evening. Thanks for having us! The El Rey is amazing. The inside is quaint and perfect for 1-2 people. Shawn sets you up for success by having a well put together guide book on the kitchen table. I woke up every morning and grabbed a hot chocolate from Java Jahns and usually hit one of the MANY awesome bar/restaurants within walking distance. I found the shower to get pretty darn warm and had no issues with the facilities. As others have mentioned the only snag is that it is hard to get wifi in the El Rey. Overall it was a great experience. We did not get communication lines identified and so missed a couple important messages from our host, but he, Shawn quickly responded when we arrived and we worked things out.  We loved the trailer.   I had a nice stay at Shawn\\'s El Rey.\\r\\nAlthough I did not meet Shawn in person I was able to check in and out without any problems. Shawn prepared everything very thoroughly: there was a binder with helpful information, extra blankets for cold nights, some extra coffee and even shampoo and body wash.\\r\\nAll in all, the El Rey was an awesome experience. Thank you, Shawn!  Shawn was really nice, checked in on us during our stay, and was super helpful. He provided a binder full of personal recommendations which were awesome as well. Our stay in the El Rey overall was really fun but I honestly wouldn\\'t recommend staying for longer than a few days. You have to go outside to access the wifi which isn\\'t awesome in winter weather and, while there\\'s a full kitchen, it isn\\'t equipped to use for cooking. The location was really awesome, a block away from the bus stop which takes you directly downtown in just over 20 minutes. I\\'d definitely recommend the El Rey for those who want something a little different :) Unique and well appointed Airbnb in a convenient location - walkable to interesting spots and buses.  It will put where the locals hang and the trailer is just freakin cool.  Shawn has a good thing going, thanks! * Shawn\\'s listing of the property is spot on-- no surprises\\r\\n* The information binder Shawn provides is comprehensive and a fun read\\r\\n* The neighborhood is friendly and walkable\\r\\n* Would revisit\\r\\n* Highly recommend! The El Rey was exactly as advertised, a funky 50\\'s trailer, nicely restored with care.  A very comfortable place to spend two nights, though we now know that we wouldn\\'t want to live full time in that small a space. We appreciated how well Shawn communicated with us and his carefully prepared directions for life in the trailer.  It was unusually cold for Seattle while we were there but we were pretty comfortable with the heated provided. Shawn was a great host. He met us at our arrival and gave us a quick run-down of the El Rey. The listing is accurate, and the trailer is really cool. The trailer heats up really quick with the small space heater that is provided. Location is primo for an UBER to Ballard or Fremont. Great jumping-off point. It rained like crazy all evening/night and it was really cool to hear it on the trailer. Thanks Shawn, we\\'ll be back. Great stay! Listing description was super accurate, and Shawn could not have been more welcoming. We loved it! Awesome place to stay. Very friendly answered any questions we had.\\r\\n Shawn was an amazing host! There to welcome us and tell us how things worked. Loved his binder of recommendations. The space was perfect and delightful! We had a nice stay in Shawn\\'s airstream! It was a great little getaway for our one night trip up to Seattle. Even in winter, it had a cozy atmosphere - a true \"glamping\" experience. Staying in the El Rey was an awesome experience! It\\'s very clean and cozy and was a joy to stay in. Shawn was really warm and welcoming from the moment I met him. I\\'m definitely coming back for another stay! The El Rey was very comfortable and Shaun was quick to respond every time we contacted him. The restaurant and cafe recommendations included in Shaun\\'s notebook were spot on and it was easy to walk to yummy Seattle food. We\\'d definitely stay there again! Rad stay. Wendy is cool, place is great, no complaints.  Wendy was so great! Her place is neat, tidy and cozy and is located in a cool area with lots of fun things close by. She was incredibly welcoming and accommodating and full of good advice for activities and places to explore. I highly recommend staying with Wendy. She truly did everything possible to help make my trip easy, convenient and fun.  Staying with Wendy Morrison was a very pleasant experience. She was very accommodating and went out of her way to give us advice for our stay in Seattle. The room was on the small side but more than enough. Cute kitchen, even though we didn\\'t have time to use it. The apartment was under renovation but Wendy was kind enough to subsidize our bill in compensation. Great location and great stay! Everything was as expected. The location of the house is very good to get fast to the city centre. Nice quiet and green suburban neighborhood, but still close to good restaurants and parks. Relaxed, friendly place to stay. Nice stay in Ballard at Wendy\\'s place! She was very accommodating with our flight schedules and gave us great tips for finding an apartment in Ballard. The patio is really cute and it\\'s a great location :) Place was very nice & cute and in an amazing location. Slate coffee a real bonus! Wendy was pleasant and communicative although we only saw her briefly a few times. Nice neighborhood and host. Wendy was a great host. Cool location with easy bus access. She also had great recommendations! Cute neighborhood. Accurate photos and description of the apartment. Wendy was welcoming and friendly, but did her own thing which was exactly what I was looking for. We never met Wendy, as she was out of town for our stay. The neighborhood was nice and within walking distance of Ballard. The only downside was that we were asked to bring our own towels which was fairly inconvenient.  Great location and walking distance to many local bars and good food!  Great host! Wendy was super sweet and not imposing whatsoever.  Neighborhood was super central and the deck was so great!  My bf and I were very comfortable.  Thanks Wendy! The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. I didn\\'t get to meet Wendy, but her roommate Kerri was there, and she was awesome! The place was overall very cute and they have a really really nice shower. It\\'s next door to slate coffee, which is one of my favorite places in seattle. 10/10! The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting. Wendy\\'s place was great! The location was perfect, very easy to explore around the great neighborhood of ballard and easy access to downtown and other parts of seattle. She gave us our privacy and was always there to answer our questions!  Wendy was helpful with directions before our arrival. Bed was comfortable, however room was not very clean and the door didn\\'t shut properly. The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Dirk\\'s family home was really lovely.  It was the perfect accommodations for our family gathering.  Lots of space, great kitchen and wonderful outside gathering space.  We spent most of our time on the deck, where there is a terrific grill set up.  We also got a chance to enjoy the HUGE Jacuzzi tub in the downstairs bedroom while the rest of the family took advantage of the two large living room room spaces (one downstairs and one upstairs).  This place is very family friendly and has everything you need for a great stay.  Thanks Dirk! We enjoyed our first trip with 8 adults to Seattle to attend a wedding held partially at a green lake house  and also in the warehouse district for the actual ceremony.We found the neighborhood we rented in  was very nice and it was a good location to be in for Seattle. We were close by to a few stores ..Walgreens and the Foodstore was a few blocks away.    We did have a car but my son and girlfriend  took the bus often to get  around to green lake,  downtown and Discovery Park.  He said it was very easy and inexpensive.  The owner Dirk provided some nice things such as coffee and soaps and shampoos  and paper products for the bathrooms which we did not expect .  The house fit our needs wonderfully with four nice bedrooms with queen or larger beds and fans were also provided for the bedrooms since when  we arrived in a Seattlethere was a heat wave 90 % every day.   We were traveling with 8 adults so all the rooms and bathrooms got used daily. They were all quite nice.     We got great use out of the kitchen and back porch that had a grill and large table to enjoy breakfasts and a few dinners. The yard was lovely and private.   We really enjoyed the house and would recommend it highly.  We even used the washer and dryer several times and were thrilled to get to try the jura  expresso machine which we became quite addicted to. Thank you for a wonderful stay!  We enjoyed seeing and attending a Seattle family wedding with our family and even  got some free time to explore the city.   We topped off the whole wedding week with a whale watch trip  off  san juan island,  friday harbor to see the orcas!  It was a great trip and we luckily saw about 25 orcas breaching!  We look forward to our return to this fun city!    What a wonderful stay at a great home! Five of us were in Seattle for a week, recording a new album, and needed a quiet, comfortable, spacious place to rest and (email hidden)e home was clean, private, large, light-filled, and so comfortable! The neighborhood was also lovely--the Ballard/Phinney area is very village-like, it\\'s easy to walk to great restaurants and shops, but also a quick drive to the rest of Seattle and beyond. We were greeted with a helpful binder of information, fresh flowers, extra coffee and cream and a few goodies in the fridge. The kitchen was well-stocked. The bedrooms were large and comfortable. The whole experience was excellent! My best Air B n B stay yet!! Thank you, Dirk. Five stars indeed. Cheers...-Sarah Dirk and his family have a wonderful and lovely home.  Great for families for a corporate work week.  Very accessible for getting around and close to Ballard stores, restaurants and bars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe process was smooth and Dirk was quite timely with communications and coordination.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\'t ask questions.  Get this house if it\\'s available.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheers,\\r\\nDamian  We highly recommend the home. It is spacious, tastefully done, warm family atmosphere and in a great location. The host was very responsive to my emails. He even gave us entrance instructions early which we really appreciated. The house was beautiful and exactly how it was described and pictured. They live in a great area with tons of stuff in walking distance and buses everywhere for the other stuff.  I recently moved from LA to Seattle for work and needed a temporary place to live while finding a permanent home.  I took a chance on Julie and Jeff’s studio apartment as the Ballard location and pictures were enticing. I was a little hesitant at first since there weren\\'t any reviews yet as they had just launched on airbnb, but my hesitation quickly diminished upon arrival. Julie greeted me warmly and the apartment was incredibly clean (a must for me), decorated well, and stocked with a ton of goodies a corporate apartment does not have (snacks, drinks, fresh towels, 3 kinds of coffee pots!, cleaning supplies, and more).  The location is close to the Stoup Brewery for craft beer fans, near the beautiful Burke Gilman Trail which is great for bike rides, and in walking distance to downtown Ballard.  Downtown Ballard is a great area with many charming area with many restaurants, cool little shops, and their famous farmers market.  Street parking was readily available in front of the apartment (and it’s free parking!).  Julie was also very on top of making sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed.  Overall, my stay here was very pleasant and helped ease my transition to a new city. A bonus, I got some great decorating ideas as the apartment has a great blend of colors and decor. We had a great time staying at Julie and Jeff\\'s little studio. The space was really cozy and very clean.  The space was really nicely put together with great attention to detail. Really nice towels, bathroom and amenities. The bed was super comfy. I especially liked the nice coffee and sparkling water in the fridge. The space was pleasant and had nice light.  Also, great snacks! The location was excellent for walking and easy to get to and from. Julie was great to communicate with and very flexible to our needs. We felt they really cared about making the space as comfortable as possible. A very sweet family and lovely experience. I would definitely recommend their space to a friend! Julia and Jeff have a wonderful little spot in a really fun area of town! My husband and I only stayed for a short time but it was comfy, private, and clean. I would recommend you stay with the Angeleys for both long term and short term stays. Thanks for the hospitality!  Jeff and Julie are great hosts. Communication was easy and everything is just as described. I loved this space and I loved the location.\\n \\nThe space has 12 foot ceilings and concrete floors with radiant heat. It is well equipped including washer/dryer which came in very handy on my 2 week stay. Jeff and Julie left out fruit and other tasty snacks. Lots of options for the coffee lover.\\n \\nLocation is easy walking distance to the center of the very popular Ballard area. Lots of great options for eating, drinking and live music. I hope to stay again on my next trip to Seattle. Our stay with Julie and Jeff was a dream.  They are such a cool family and the suite is spacious but cozy, clean and well styled with an eye for design.  Location is excellent for Ballard explorations, with Ballard Ave shops and restaurants a walk away, but still in a quiet peaceful (website hidden) lovers, there are a number of microbreweries within stumbling distance, some with rotating food trucks parked nearby.  Julie and Jeff were easy to communicate with, wonderful resources on the area, and just really awesome people.  We were sad to leave our new Seattle getaway but look forward to staying with the Angeleys on our next trip down! This is my first time booking on Airbnb and I could not have had a better experience! My partner and I stayed at the studio for a weekend; we were thoroughly impressed with the space (clean, inviting, and stocked with delicious snacks) and it\\'s close proximity to breweries, restaurants, and shops. Julie and Jeff were great hosts and made sure we have everything we needed. I would definitely book with them again on my next trip to Seattle! I don\\'t even know where to begin!  We had such a wonderful stay at Jeff and Julie\\'s place.  They really have thought of every little detail in order to make you feel at home.  We visit Seattle about twice a year and will definitely be choosing their place again next time around!  The location is perfect, walking distance to the heart of Ballard where we generally spend alot of our time.  Street parking is easy and we loved the brewery across the street.  My fiance even found the amazing breakfast taco truck in the area, thanks to a very helpful guide they left in the apt for us.  The snack, drinks, coffee and tea was such a nice touch too.\\r\\n\\r\\nJulie even went beyond the call of duty by helping me orchestrate a surprise third guest (my fiance\\'s friend who showed up as a surprise in Seattle).  She hid the bedding for the futon so that my fiance wouldn\\'t suspect anything.  And the place was very comfortable for three people, so if you are debating that, trust that it will work just fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan\\'t say enough great things about this place!  My only fear is that the word will get out and they\\'ll be booked solid next time we want to visit! :)\\r\\n\\r\\n Julie and Jeff have created a fantastic place that I hope to have the pleasure of staying in again the next time I visit Seattle.  You will find details everywhere that show how much thought has gone into preparing the studio for guests from snacks, drinks, toiletries, more.  It felt like the roomiest studio I\\'ve ever stayed in, certainly the biggest bathroom!  Everything was spotless and the radiant heat was incredibly pleasant.  I also loved the location as it was super quiet(the chickens didn\\'t bother me, I found them entertaining) but easy to get around, either by bus or walking(close to Walrus and Carpenter!).  I was sorry to leave so quickly but will definitely return! Great apartment in an awesome neighborhood. The studio had everything I needed and more. Definitely one of the most comfortable beds I\\'ve slept on. Thanks for the great stay! Staying at the studio was a dream. The place is immaculate, stylish, quirky, and the hosts thought of everything! The location was perfect, you can walk to shops, bars, and awesome restaurants. They let us borrow bikes, visit their chickens, and even loaned me a yoga mat. Next time I\\'m in Seattle I\\'m definitely staying here again! We had an amazing time staying here. We had a few requests (due to a 2 year old) and they went above and beyond making sure our stay was comfortable. We would highly recommend staying here. We hope to stay again! I had a wonderful time staying in Julie and Jeff\\'s charming space. I loved the creative spirit of both the studio and yard beyond, and especially the quirky mix of backyard chickens in this hipster (but quiet) area. The space itself is extremely well appointed with thoughtful items that may (and do) come in handy, the bed is wonderful and Julie and Jeff are kind and gracious hosts. I\\'m a regular traveler to Seattle and look forward to staying again with Julie and Jeff.  First things first, Jeff and Julie are wonderful hosts.  Super friendly and very cool people!  They had snacks and coffee stocked in the kitchen and toiletries in the bathroom just in case you forgot something.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the place, it was perfect!  Amazing overhead door that is perfect for a sunny day.  Bed was really comfortable, and the place stayed nice and comfortable with the radiant floor heating system.  Loved it!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to Jeff for showing us the chickens and to Julie for the local knowledge. Julie has a super adorable studio, perfect for a girls trip to the city. Walking distance from downtown Ballard and several 24 hr grocery stores. Easy to pick up the Burke-Tillman trail and walk or bike all the way to Fremont. Quieter part of town (which we loved) and easy parking, but close to all your amenities. Had a fantastic time, and the snacks Julie left for us we\\'re great for our excursions and hike! Only thing to note, though, is that there isn\\'t a stove, but there is a microwave and toaster oven. Otherwise, everything was great. Thanks, Julie!! Jeff and Julie have a great place here!  It was very clean, organized and well decorated.  This is a great location, right across the street from a micro-brewery and a short walk to downtown Ballard.  We appreciated the delicious organic snacks.  We highly recommend this loft for a Seattle trip!! We had a great time in Seattle. The studio was roomy and light.  The bed was very comfortable. It was an easy walk to get groceries and to restaurants and bars.  Julie and jeff had a book of walking tours and maps to help find your way around.  We had friends in the neighborhood,  so we didnt borrow the bikes that they had for guests to uuse.  Julie was even nice enough to let us stay a little later in the afternoon so we didnt have to haul our stuff to lunch or downtown while we waited for our train back to portland. We would definitely stay here again and will suggest it to our friends . Thanks again, Julie! Amazing place. The reviews and photos are spot on. Julie I the consummate host. She helped with directions to the place and to local eateries. \\n\\nThe studio had great decor.  There was also a huge basket of granola, Organic snacks and fruit. Plus the fridge was packed with great water and other refreshments. \\n\\nSkip the hotel, stay with Julie & Jeff My boyfriend and I stayed at Julie and Jeff\\'s studio over a long weekend at the end of April. We loved our time there. The apartment is in a great location--you can walk to a variety of restaurants, cafes, breweries, and stores with ease. The apartment itself is lovely. It had everything we needed and the bed was one of the most comfortable we\\'ve ever slept on. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone going to Seattle.  I don\\'t have much to add, mostly echoing the positive reviews here! The space is good sized, nicely appointed, and we loved the big garage door to open up on a nice day, not to mention the cool brewery across the street. Took public transportation our whole time there and easily ventured to/from the airport as well as into nearby Ballard and Fremont, Greenlake, downtown, West Seattle, and down to SoDo for the Sounders game. Nice location, kind and accessible hosts. If we weren\\'t moving into town, we\\'d surely think of this spot for another visit, and may well direct friends/family this way when they come into town. Thanks! We had a wonderful experience staying with Jeff & Julie.  They did an amazing job setting up the studio.  We loved the modern, light filled space.  Even though it was a small place, there seemed to be plenty of room for our stuff because of the smart choices in furnishings and utensils made by our hosts.  The neighborhood is a vibrant mix of residential, workshops and breweries.  Grocery store is close too.   We opted to rent a car and felt it was a good decision.  We loved the way the apt. can be opened up to the outdoors.   This is a great place to stay! The studio was more than we had hoped for, and in a better location than we expected. It was easy to get to and we needed to go back into Seattle several times, which was very easy. We appreciated the snacks, since we were on the go. My experience with our stay was positive! We stayed here for three nights and loved the area. It is around the local breweries (across the street from Stoups!), near excellent food options (El Camión, anyone?!), and just a hop and a skip from downtown Ballard. Fremont is quite near as well. There are close shopping areas and local public transit is just two blocks away. My husband and I made use of the bikes and that really helped us get around (usually on the Burke Gilman bike trail). Jeff and Julie were very helpful and kind. They stocked the refrigerator with milk, soy milk, snack cheese, and cream. There were selections of wholesome food and gummy bears in the kitchen! It was clean and adorable. Definitely has activity going on around it though, so helps to maintain your own privacy and just enjoy the sounds of life and activity!  Julie and Jeff\\'s place was amazing, the studio was just perfect and loved the snacks they left for us in the studio. Well kept and very clean, the area was in a perfect location close walk to all Ballard Shops and we took uber, and the bus to get to other places, but the commute was not long. The bikes were also nice to have to ride to grab coffee or crepes near by! Definitely coming back to Seattle and staying at this amazing studio!  We had a terrific stay at Julie & Jeff\\'s. The room was adorable, very clean, and they even left out some snacks. Very accommodating hosts, too, and easy to work with. The studio is in Ballard close to the main street, which is a very fun neighborhood (though a 10 min Uber from downtown). Julie and Jeff\\'s place was absolutely great. Location worked out well: it\\'s just a couple minute walk from Ballard Ave. And the unit itself is great. Has everything you need (even a brand new washer and dryer), and Julie and Jeff provided a bunch of snacks, drinks, etc.\\n\\nHighly recommend, and would definitely stay again.\\n\\n This was such a wonderful place to stay! We could not have asked for a more beautiful and well-thought out apartment, nor nicer hosts. We arrived in Seattle after camping in Olympic National Park without running water for three days, and were greeted by a quirky, comfortable place, incredible amenities (including washer & dryer for which we were humbly grateful) and a well stocked pantry & fridge. Julie and Jeff were so welcoming, thoughtful and great people to chat with. The apartment is in a really fun neighborhood in Seattle and we enjoyed going to the Ballard farmers market, trying the micro-brewery literally across the street and riding the two cruiser bikes around the city. I could not recommend this place more highly!  We had a really lovely stay at Julie and Jeff\\'s place. They were very welcoming, and everything was set up so nicely. Ballard is a really fun area to stay in, and we would love to stay at the studio again if we are ever back in Seattle!  We are so grateful to have chosen to stay at Julie and Jeff\\'s studio for our 5th anniversary.  Their hospitality exceeded our expectations - they were attentive but gave plenty of space and autonomy.  We kept saying that they were \"our kind of people\" in so many ways.  The studio was was just as it appeared in the pictures - beautiful and a great amount of space for two.  Loved the location - really convenient for getting all over Seattle.  We\\'ll be spreading the word and would happily stay at the studio again if given the opportunity.  A great first experience using airbnb. My husband and I visited the Ballard studio while on vacation, and we really enjoyed our stay. The location is great; very fun neighborhood with cool restaurants and bars and only a short bus ride to downtown Seattle. The studio itself is perfect for two guests. The hosts really thought of everything in provisioning the studio, with coffee, tea, local magazines and books, snacks, etc. Also, it was really nice having a washer and dryer on site to do laundry. We would definitely stay here again on a future visit to Seattle! We had a wonderful time staying in Julie and Jeff\\'s loft-like apartment.  I absolutely loved how it was decorated and they thought of every amenity one could possibly need.  We felt very comfortable there for our week stay.  And the location was amazing- we could walk to Safeway, restaurants, a drug store and the brewery directly across the street.  I would stay here again in a heart beat.  Thanks again.  :)   We really loved staying at this cool studio in Ballard. Super cute decor, plus it\\'s really spacious. We were so happy to be able to do our laundry (after many days of camping.) Also, it was so nice to borrow the cruisers and bike all over Seattle. Highly recommend staying here! We had a wonderful time staying here. The apartment is comfortable and has easy access to both Fremont and Ballard. Plus, the fresh coffee, snacks, and brewery across the street offer everything you could need. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  We were very comfortable in Julie and Jeff\\'s loft. It\\'s a beautifully designed, light-filled, and clean space. Our hosts were hospitable and attentive and the studio came well stocked (with snacks and plenty of local info). The location was ideal and convenient. We highly recommend their place and hope to return again someday soon. This little studio was perfect. And exactly as described. Maybe cooler actually. Located in industrial Ballard surrounded by breweries. Spacious, clean and convenient-we had been on the road for 3 weeks already and having powerful washer and dryer was very welcomed. High ceilings. Comfortable queen bed and couch. The modern industrial garage door is fun and practical. They compose. If you like urban loft living this is your place. \\r\\nWe met Julie and Jeff and liked them immediately. Jeff has a big workshop in the back and chickens. Yes, chickens. And a turkey-and a chicken that thinks he is a turkey. We will be back for sure.\\r\\nThank you! Julie was great!  She was available to answer questions and give suggestions when we needed them and we really appreciated that!  The flat was clean and cozy, the bikes were a super fun addition and the neighborhood was happening!  Overall a great stay!   We LOVED our experience at the Ballard Studio. The space is wonderfully decorated and has everything we could need (including coffee, tea, snacks, etc.)  The location is great as well-- within walking distance to many great restaurants, coffee shops, breweries, and an easy bus ride into downtown. We would love to stay here next time we come to Seattle! Julie & Jeff were great hosts and provided clear and easy directions to the apartment.  We really enjoyed staying at Julie & Jeff\\'s apartment.  The apartment was just as described. Food items and drinks helped us get through first hours of settling in and their coffee beans provided us with great morning coffee. The warehouse/factory nature of the area gave us some concern but it turned out to be quite and safe. Car parked on the street around the corner with no problems. Julie and Jeff are personable people who made sure we had everything we needed - didn\\'t really need anything as the apartment met our requirements. We enjoyed their little farmyard with chickens and a turkey in a fenced area next to the apartment.  All the local tourist info in the basket was also very helpful. We would stay their again except that our son and his family moved to another area of Seattle while we were staying at Julie & Jeff\\'s. We had a great time staying at the studio in Ballard - great area to explore with fun shops and restaurants.  We loved the nearby neighborhood of Fremont as well.  The studio was CLEAN, comfortable and Julie and Jeff made us feel very welcome with everything we needed in the studio. Thanks!  If you want to stay in Ballard, I\\'m not sure why you would stay anywhere else. The location is awesome; we could have thrown a rock and hit Stoup Brewery, walked around to the corner to another, and then another. Not to mention you are walking distance away from Ballard shopping, restaurants, Percy\\'s cocktails, the locks, etc. We were coming from staying in downtown Seattle, so I can\\'t answer the accessibility to downtown from Ballard, but we were able to drive to our reservation in Capitol Hill with ease (about 10 min). But aside from how great the location is, the space itself is wonderful. Very cool decor, very comfortable, and Julie and Jeff have thought of every amenity that one might need while traveling. There was soy milk and regular milk, excellent coffee, and a plethora of healthy snacks laid out for us upon arrival. Robes, slippers, washer and dyer, extra pillows and blankets, and the option to take out their cruisers while you\\'re there. We showed up on a Thursday and the street was a bit crowded with brewery goers, but our hosts were kind enough to let us park in the driveway until the crowd died down a bit. Julie checked in with us when we first arrived to make sure we were comfortable, and assured us we could contact her or Jeff with any questions we might have. If you\\'re looking for somewhere to stay in Seattle, this space and the host are legit, and I highly recommend it! We will be staying here next time we\\'re in Seattle. We had a great time at the apt!  Very clean, very industrial and in a great neighborhood close to Ballard.  We would definitely stay here again.   Couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to stay. Julie and Jeff have thought of everything to make staying at this Ballard gem the ultimate experience! Healthy snacks when you need a pick up? Check. Bikes to get around the coolest parts of town? Check. (Though do be warned-cruisers are a bit tough to ride on the Seattle hills). Central to two of the best breweries in Seattle? Check. This place is like home away from home. We loved it and didn\\'t want to leave!  We cannot say enough great things about our stay at Julie and Jeff\\'s! The studio was a fun, convenient location. The interior was beautiful and perfectly accommodating. The offered bikes were a fun change from public transportation. And while we didn\\'t meet Jeff, we very much enjoyed our conversations with Julie, she made herself easily accessible if we needed anything. \\n\\nThank you so much Jeff and Julie! Our stay at private studio in Ballard was more than perfect! Julie was there at our arrival and gave us good tips for our stat! There\\'s great restaurant on Ballard Avenue at 5 min. From the studio. It is also really easy to go downtown using the bus, it\\'s a 20 minutes ride. The studio was really clean at our arrival and the mattress is really comfortable. Julie left a basket full of organic snack that was really convenient after a long day exploring the city!!  We really recommend this studio!  They set up a pack n play for our 9 month old with some toys in it.  When they saw that we liked to dine al fresca, they set up a table with two chairs for us. Had a great time in Ballard! The location was perfect and all it took was a little drive to get anywhere in the area. If we didn\\'t want to drive a quick walk would result in great food in different Seattle districts. The location allowed us to absorb \"real\" experiences of how people in the area live. My partner and I arrived to the space later in the evening than we expected, but all was just as described- and beautiful to boot! It was a perfect space, chalk full of anything one could want or need to make their stay comfortable. I really feel like the hosts didn\\'t over look a single thing when preparing this property, and I would happily have friends/guests stay with them in the future! The garage door was so nice to have open on the main day we stayed here (we were prepping for a wedding), it made life so much easier in general as well as added natural light galore! I truly appreciate airBnb hosts who have properties this lovely, and happily recommend Julie and Jeff to all! Endroit extra, les hôtes sont génial tout était parfait.Un grand merci. I unfortunately was not able to stay at Jeff and Julie\\'s due to travel plans being canceled last minute. It is important to note though, that throughout the communication during booking process was well above any of my expectations and the next work trip I have out to the west cost this will be the first place I try to book. Really great place to stay in the Seattle area, little breakfast snacks, shower stuff, and heated floors. The brewery\\'s are super close. Jeff and Julie will lend you some bikes if you need it. They give you your space when it comes to hosting. I\\'d say their studio is an ideal place to stay for anyone looking to tour Seattle, off the tourist path. (Plus you can bring your dog) Julie and Jeff\\'s place was perfect for our weekend away. They left really detailed info about the apartment and area around so it was easy to get settled in and feel at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s just a quick walk to downtown Ballard and there\\'s a neat brewery right across the street. Jeff & Julie\\'s suite in Ballard was great. It hjd all the amenities you could need and more; as good as staying at a hotel but with the comforts of home. The location in Ballard is also great; tucked away in a cool industrial/residential area, but walking distance to shops and restaurants. The Trader Joe\\'s a few blocks away was also a plus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only downsides would be the noisy chickens in the yard and but nothing that would deter me from staying again. This is a great place to stay.  It is immaculately clean.  The amenities are excellent, including: snacks, washer/dryer, kitchen with refrigerator, microwave and dishes.  It is well located near stores and downtown Ballard.  It is exactly as presented in the Airbnb posting. We were in town for Thanksgiving so never got to meet Julie and Jeff in person, but that didn\\'t stop them from making us feel welcome. The studio is in a great location (across the street from a brewery), it\\'s well stocked with basic amenities and offers three different ways of making coffee. Despite the driving rain, we had a couple of great days. We\\'ll definitely try to rebook for future visits. Amazing stay, the location was simply perfect (and with so many breweries nearby how can you go wrong). Really short walk to so many transport options as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe studio was just as advertised, neat and tidy, all amenities which was so helpful, and wholesome snacks on our arrival which was most generous, and most appreciated. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe loved our stay, no hassles and would highly recommend. My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Julie and Jeff\\'s studio. The place was perfect -- nice kitchen area, washer/dryer and a spacious bathroom too. Plus, coffee, tea and snacks were left out for us which was really nice. Julie and Jeff were lovely people. I highly recommend their studio. The most awesome of spots! They leave awesome snacks and great instructions on how to get around in the area. \\n\\nWould visit again! \\n We stayed at Julie and Jeff\\'s studio over the Christmas holiday 2014.  This place worked very well for us.  It is very clean and well designed. Nice bathroom and new washer/dryer.   Comfortable bed. Nice and quiet. They are great hosts.  We had a wonderful experience throughout our stay at Julie and Jeff\\'s home. Their location is close to a ton of places in Ballard and Ballard itself is a beautiful community. We highly recommend staying at their place when visiting Seattle. The home is very clean and comfortable and supplied with everything one may need. Having a washer/dryer in the unit was also a nice extra. They even set up a pack and play and left baby books and toys for our new baby! Julie and Jeff were also readily available when we had any questions. From our family to theirs we are thankful. :) what a gem!  adorable space - they\\'re lucky I left because I legitimately want to move in.  Great part of town, easy to retrieve lock, good communication by hosts.  Thoughtful touches in the kitchen as well.  Would absolutely stay again & recommend to friends.   Cute space.  Yummy snacks.  Great location.  A+. Would stay again.  The listing was as described-very industrial feel, yet warm and cozy. Julie was very accessible and I was delighted to stay-my boyfriend loved the birthday surprise trip! Thank you for the warm welcome and for the travel maps you provided-very helpful. I\\'ve stayed in a few Airbnb\\'s and this one is my favourite. Great space, perfect location and Jeff and July are always easy to deal with and very helpful. This was our second stay with Julie and Jeff.  The place is terrific.  Ultra clean.  Everything is as stated in the description.  Hope to stay there again on our next visit. This place is awesome. Excellent price and the coolest neighborhood in Seattle. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in a hip neighborhood with tons of amazing restaurants and bars in walking distance! Julie was great with communication from the very beginning. We did not get the pleasure to meet her or Jeff, but instructions were very clear and helpful. Ballard is a great neighborhood. I\\'d say it\\'s important to know that this place is in Industrial Ballard and is a little walk (15 minutes or so) from the main Ballard area, which has an awesome record store (Bop Records) and a lot of restaurants. This listing is very close to a bus stop (3 blocks or less) that will take you downtown in 20 minutes with no transfers. It\\'s also a bonus to be close to the Fremont area via bus. It\\'s full of boutiques, bars, and restaurants. Thank you, Julie and Jeff for being great hosts!  These are a few of my favorite things about the stay at Julie & Jeff\\'s:  fluffy white robes in the bathroom, an abundance of clean linens, a well-rounded snack bar, including fruits and coffee fixings, in a well-equipped kitchenette.  The bed is sooo comfortable, and the apartment is situated in the back of the well-insulated house with a lot of privacy.  Ballard is an interesting mix of industrial, residential and commercial that is quiet at night and is just a short drive or bus trip to Seattle.  I was completely happy with this, my first Airbnb experience, and can highly recommend Julie & Jeff\\'s.   Although I was not able to personally meet Julie and Jeff, I still felt very welcomed and at home during my stay in Seattle! Their studio was the perfect size; comfortable and well heated for us Californians who were not used to the Seattle cold weather. We also really appreciated that you kept in contact with us throughout our stay and the snacks that you provided in the kitchen! The place was also conveniently located near public transportation, which made it easier for us to travel around the city. Thank you for the wonderful stay, Julie and Jeff! We hope to come back again!  This little spot was lovely: equipped with snacks, maps, soaps and towels and a very comfy bed. Julie gave us great info prior to our arrival and we found the spot with no problem on our own. We did arrive when Julie was there to personally give us her take on the neighborhood and its breweries (Ballard is the burgeoning \"brewer\\'s district\" of Seattle and my husband is a big aficionado so this was a highlight for us). Nice brewery directly across the street, easy access to multiple supermarkets (there is a toaster oven, fridge, and microwave in the studio) and bus lines into downtown Seattle. We would definitely stay again on our next trip. The studio was great! Beautiful, clean space; hotel-like fluffy towels & bathrobes; a basket of treats to warm the kitchen; etc. A wonderful starting place from which to explore Ballard. We arrived very late after a crazy flight delay, and it was so great to arrive at a place of our own that felt like home. Julie & Jeff were wonderful hosts - great communicators & very friendly.  What a great experience! Julie & Jeff have really thought out this space to make it super accommodating for short or long stays. We were there for two weeks and it was just about perfect - esp. having access to a washer/dryer right in the studio and three different ways to make coffee! Julie was always very responsive to any requests we had throughout our stay - bringing some additional supplies to us, etc. I worked part-time from the studio and the wireless was very good (if that is a consideration for anyone).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe space is as pictured, some of the furnishings are slightly different than the pictures, but nothing shocking. It\\'s really just a cool little studio, very functional and very well thought out - I\\'m a fan of the industrial look so I loved the aesthetic along with the functionality. Really just overall a great experience. We\\'ll definitely recommend to any friends going to the Seattle area looking for a comfortable place to stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the Ballard area, it is super convenient too - we walked to a new restaurant (~15 minute walk from the studio) every night. You can (almost) literally throw a stone in any direction to hit a brewery in the area. Stoup is right across the street and has a delicious food truck outside on most nights (making it easy to grab a bite if you\\'re tired from exploring all day). Our favorite brewery in the area was Peddler Brewing, a short walk up the way. In addition to easy eating and drinking, the studio is a short walk from several bus stops that will connect you to different parts of town and a short walk from convenience and grocery stores. Super easy to get anywhere you want from here (bus timeliness is another story, but unrelated to the review of this space).\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all - awesome spot. Highly recommend. Thanks! This studio is a wonderful spot to stay at! It\\'s clean, super cute, functional, comfortable and located in an ideal location (right across from a great local brewery). I had a terrific experience and would highly recommend the spot!  I almost don\\'t know where to begin! \\n\\nBetween the Ballard Farmers Market, Stoup Brewery across the street, and the worlds most comfortable bed---we cannot express how much we loved our stay with Julie & Jeff. \\n\\nEverything was beyond wonderful & it gave us a chance to explore as if we were locals. \\n\\nThe robes, welcome basket & quick responses only made our experience even more seamless. Thank you so much!  Julie and Jeff\\'s studio was spacious comfortable and quiet. All the logistics went very smoothly and they were very welcoming. The location is in the heart of industrial Ballard, a safe an walk-able area with new businesses popping up every time I visit. Including some of the best nano-breweries I have found in any city! I had a lovely experience with Julie. She was very welcoming and understanding. The apartment was in a great location and it was nice and clean. There was enough room for 3 people. Will be back again for sure in the future! Thanks Julie!   We absolutely loved this studio. We were in town for a few days to explore the area and this was a great home base.  The area (Ballard) is beautiful and interesting.  Great restaurants all within about a mile. Breweries and food trucks also super close. And even though everything is so close, there is no noise pollution at all.\\n\\nThe studio itself is stocked with so many thoughtful details: snacks, coffee and tea, water, maps and guides, robes and slippers. My husband and I were very comfortable and we will definitely love to stay there again when we are next in the area. We had an amazing experience at Julie and Jeff\\'s studio.  It was one of the best stays we have had in our time with airbnb.  Check in/out was smooth.  Julie and Jeff were easy to communicate with and were accommodating with anything that could have come up during our stay. The studio is cozy and has everything you could need for your stay.  Julie and Jeff had a variety of tea, coffee and snacks set out for us and had clearly put a lot of heart into making it as comfortable as possible. There is a fridge in the studio as well as a washer and dryer.  The bed was comfy and had plenty of blankets and pillows.  Everything was neat and clean.  The location was great!  You could walk to some of the nearby breweries as well as to the shops and restaurants in the Ballard neighborhood. We would highly recommend it! This cozy place is an absolute jewel located in a great area. Julie and Jeff are the best hosts - they have put so much thought into every detail in this wonderful space. We were so comfortable and appreciative.  The neighborhood is great -  we walked to breweries, restaurants, and parks with our dog, and there are lots of public transportation options to get downtown or elsewhere in the city. There were snacks and detailed information on the studio and neighborhood waiting when we arrived. Julie and Jeff checked in on us over the weekend to make sure everything was okay and see if we needed anything. The space is very creative and perfect for our stay. We would definitely stay there again!  This place was awesome! Great location, plenty of privacy, and we felt so cool about ourselves waking up here :) Julie and Jeff\\'s place is awesome. I want to move in. They have taken care making it gorgeous, cool, comfortable, and totally travel friendly. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey went above and beyond to stock little treats for us, multiple methods of brewing local coffee, bikes, everything. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe loved opening the glass garage door wall in the morning and getting ready for our Seattle day. \\r\\n\\r\\nJulie was amazingly accommodating - letting us check in early and out late. She quickly responded to every question. A great host. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe area is industrial as advertized but there\\'s tons to walk and bike to. Some of the nationally recognized restaurants that we\\'d read about and wanted to visit were located right near by.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had an awesome stay and would definitely stay again.  Julie & Jeff\\'s studio was a great home base for us to explore the Ballard neighborhood and the rest of the city. Bonus: the studio is walking distance from several breweries. The studio is comfortable, very nice, and had more amenities than expected (snacks, maps, bike rental). We\\'d definitely recommend staying here!  This apartment is located in walking distance many shops and restaurants in the Ballard district. Apt was clean, quiet and comfy. The only negative is the washer wasnt working. They left little snacks for us and there was a small fridge for us to use. It is directly across the a nice brewery. We never saw our hosts but they were friendly via email. I would visit this apartment again.  We absolutely loved everything about our stay: the location, the apartment, Ballard and the ease of communication. Julie and Jeff really went above and beyond to make this place a gem, providing a hip, well-designed and CLEAN space with lots of snacks and extra amenities. We took advantage of the cruisers and LOVED exploring the city. You can\\'t beat the location if you want to be close to restaurants, cafes, breweries and/or the water. We would recommend this to anyone!  The studio was more than I could have hoped for. Julie and Jeff did a great job setting up the place for our stay. The studio is very spacious and chic. They provided plenty of great amenities (for example: bikes, snacks, maps, neighborhood guides, coffee and tea, bath robes, etc.) The surrounding neighborhood is great. It is within walking distance to grocery stores, coffee shops, breweries and is only a 10-15 minute drive into downtown. There is plenty of street parking right in front of the house and is not a problem at all. Communication with Julie and Jeff was easy and responsive. the next time I\\'m in Seattle I would love to stay here again! We really enjoyed staying at Julie and Jeff\\'s Ballard studio. It\\'s in a great location, walkable to the main Ballard strip and very easy to get downtown by car. The unit was very cozy and Jeff was very helpful in answering any questions we had. We also appreciated the snacks they provided. Fun and funky space with charming touches wherever you look. The apartment is small but doesn\\'t feel that way- every bit of space is used efficiently and effectively. Jeff and Julie left snacks and drinks for us which were much appreciated upon arrival. Comfy bed, luxurious shower, plush robes and towels, a generous kitchen sink... highly recommend. Jeff and Julie are friendly and helpful. We got a private tour of the chicken coup. This is a terrific place to stay in Seattle- and Stoup brewery is right across the street. They have delicious beer and a food truck is on site every night. Highly recommend! Julie and Jeff were wonderful hosts, and this studio was perfect for our stay in Seattle! It is located within walking distance to downtown Ballard, where there are plenty of shops and restaurants to hang out in. We also biked to Freemont multiple times using the cruisers they provided for us! Downtown Seattle is easily accessible by bus. Julie and Jeff were very accommodating and provided us with plenty of goodies upon our arrival. They were super flexible as well, and even allowed us to store our bags there after checkout for the day until we had to be at the airport. Really the only less-than-awesome thing was the fact that we were there during a heat wave (early July) and there was no AC. However, from my knowledge, most of Seattle has no AC due to the usually fabulous temperatures. Overall, our stay was absolutely perfect in this modern, industrial, wonderfully-decorated studio! It is ideal for a couple and was plenty spacious enough for my husband and I. We fully intend on coming back to Julie and Jeff\\'s soon! We feel so lucky to have found the listing for Julie and Jeff\\'s studio! The house and studio were very cool-looking, and it was kept up very well. I had no problem communicating with Julie about our arrival, and she was very nice in person. The space was very clean,  larger than an average hotel room, and included everything we needed. It is obvious that great effort has been made to make guests comfortable here. The snacks and information provided were very helpful, especially since our 8 year-old twins were with us on this first trip to Seattle. A short walk to the park kept them busy between activities. We would definitely stay here again! I want to live here. Seriously. This well designed contemporary space has all the necessary comforts (ok, if I lived here I\\'d add a wardrobe and a stove), and lots of tiny details that made it even better. The roll up garage door and fan made an unusually hot summer in Seattle easy, and the deliciously comfortable bed and linens made for wonderful sleep, until the friendly chickens nudged me awake with their clucking. The washer and dryer were handy. \\r\\nI was expecting an even more industrial area, and didn\\'t realize it would be such a quick and easy walk to Market Street and central Ballard with its shops and restaurants. Julie was quick to respond to texts an emails, which made check-in and out easy, and the water and yogurt and snacks in the perfectly equipped compact kitchen were a sweet touch. I\\'m hoping to stay here again.  This is a great little studio - clean, comfortable and private. In addition, Julie and Jeff\\'s hospitality was fantastic!!! We really enjoyed our stay and hope to visit again.  Accueil très agréable , logement conforme à l\\'annonce. Appartement très propre et très bien équipé avec pleins d\\'attention de la part de Julie ( corbeille de fruit yaourt chocolat....). Très bon lit y compris le lit complémentaire. Accès facile à Seattle et supermarché à coté. Bref un  très bon choix au calme!  The studio was perfect.  Very clean, modern and they thought of everything.  They left treats, neighborhood guides, had robes.  Let\\'s just say, they were speaking my language.  Located in a really cool neighborhood with ample parking and things to do walking distance.  There even is a brewery across the street.  I never met them but I appreciated being left alone as well at times.  I would stay here again for my next visit to Seattle. This is a great little space, that makes good use of the industrialized space it is built out of. It was cozy, pet friendly, and served it\\'s purpose well. Be aware that their is no oven/stove or A/C, but otherwise, has everything you would expect in a small studio apartment. We just had a wonderful visit in Seattle visiting our grown children and thought the airbnb experience might be more authentic than a large hotel. Although the unit is right across the street from a great brewery (Stoup) the neighborhood was quiet overall. Yet only 2-3 blocks away are restaurants, unique shops, live music, groceries, food trucks and the bus line. Julie and Jeff have created a charming functional space with all the right details. Loved having the washer/dryer in the unit, fresh coffee beans, robes, books, and fresh fruit! We would definitely stay here again.  This was my husband and I\\'s first airbnb experience. Julie and Jeff made it perfect! We lucked out and choose the best in the area! Close enough to walk to restaurants, breweries, and shops. They had the studio perfectly set up and unique! It was roomy enough to stay in all week. We even had my brother and wife over to hang and there was plenty of room for that. Everything that we needed was there, from coffee to towels to robes to snacks. Couldn\\'t have asked for a more amazing first time! Highly recommended! This was a really fun spot to stay in when visiting Seattle. We loved the neighborhood and the studio was fantastic. Julie and Jeff are great hosts and checked in regularly to be sure we were ok. The space was super clean and quiet. There were snacks, coffee and water available in the kitchen, which was a very nice touch. We would definitely recommend this studio to others. Julie and Jeff were excellent hosts! This space was clean, well stocked, and tucked away in on the perfect street in Ballard.  We had everything we needed for our stay and more.  I would definitely come back here for my next Seattle adventure! We were thrilled with our short stay at the studio. Every detail made us feel welcome: the style, the snacks, the robes and slippers, great towels... All perfect. It was equipped with everything we could think of, and was immaculate! Three of us fit comfortably, and never felt like we were on top of each other. The neighborhood was convenient to the more bustling part of Ballard, while also being quiet. We even loved the occasional, friendly cluck of their chickens... So charming. Hope to return soon, and will recommend zebus spot to anyone we know planning a trip to Seattle! Julie and Jeff\\'s place was great. Very cool studio in a nice location. We were in the area to look for apartments and had no trouble finding free street parking for the rental car. Across the street is a very cool brewery/bar that\\'s perfect for an after dinner drink. The restaurant strip with Walrus and the Carpenter, etc is just a short walk away. Highly recommended.  We had a really great stay at Julie and Jeff\\'s place in Ballard which was superb. A great area with loads to do, and all in a walking distance. Would definitely recommend. The studio was everything we needed. We had a wonderful stay. The neighborhood was easy to find and parking was easy. The studio was tucked away toward the back of the property. Very spacious and inviting. The laundry was a huge plus for us as we had been traveling. We loved the snacks and coffee. \\r\\n\\r\\nBreweries, bars, restaurants, and all of the downtown nightlife was in walking distance. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall our stay was top notch. As one of our first Airbnb rentals, we were very impressed with Julie and Jeff\\'s industrial studio. Julie made us feel very welcome upon arrival and even provided us with a nice assortment of snacks and drinks. The studio itself was spacious yet cozy, providing for a very relaxing experience. We will definitely be staying here when we visit next year.  The room was cozy and welcoming. We loved that Julie and Jeff provided us with some snacks in the kitchen (and coffee)! Everything was very clean and comfortable.  We loved this place! The bed was comfy, the towels were huge, there were snacks and coffee!...the brewery across the street was awesome- I only wish we hadn\\'t waited until the last night to try it out. An easy walk to everything Ballard has to offer and a quick uber ride to everything else. Our hosts were very accommodating and super laid back. I would most definitely stay here again! Awesome Julie and Jeff were great hosts and super accommodating! My girlfriend and I wanted to visit Seattle for her birthday and didn\\'t want to stay in the typical touristy locations. This place has everything you could want with a more \"local\" vibe while not skimping on great places nearby. The studio space was exactly as described in the listing and we were very satisfied with our experience staying there. I am a little disappointed that we did not have time to meet our wonderful hosts however our trip to Seattle was not huge on downtime. The studio itself was fairly spacious and comfortable for two, however I would not recommend additional guests staying in the space. Everything about this place felt easy though, from finding the unit to check in/check out and requesting additional items. The location of the studio was a huge selling point on this place as well. Located across the street from a great brewery and in walking distance to many others, there was no shortage of high quality beverages nearby. Also in short walking distance were grocery stores, excellent restaurants, boutique shopping, a spacious park, and access to several public transportation options. I would highly recommend this studio not just based on comfort and convenience, but also on excellent location and superb hosts. The next time I visit Seattle I hope this place is available.  The studio is even more charming than the photos show and provides a peaceful respite for guests at the end of a busy day. Well decorated with a fun vibe and all furniture is extremely comfortable. I enjoyed the tasty treats Julie left in the kitchen/fridge and got a few more from the local grocery store only a few blocks away.  Julie is very easy to reach and full of positive energy.  Ballard is filled with great little venues for shopping, eating and drinking. The beer at the taproom just across the street from the studio is some of the best I had all season. I would love to return someday in the future.\\r\\n We had a wonderful experience here! The studio was down right dreamy. We loved all of the small, thoughtful touches like coffee beans and fresh cream, extra towels, and fun decor. Would definitely recommend grabbing a pint at the brewery right across the street-makes for a very convenient night cap! Don\\'t know what I can add to all the great reviews already in place.  It is a very nice place. Great location. Brewery across the street with a food truck every evening. Try and beat that!  I use airbnb for business yet so far this is the only place I have stayed at, where I would come back to just hang out. The check in and checkout experience was super smooth. The place itself is very stylish and cozy. Julie was super accommodating and even brought down a steamer for me to use. Excellent place, will definetly book again if in the area. So private, so comfortable! I love staying at Julie & Jeff\\'s. The kitchenette is well-equipped, fluffy white robes and towels are provided (love!) and the bed is curtained to feel cozy and secure. The studio has plenty of lighting, room to settle in if you\\'re staying for a number of days and parking is a breeze. You\\'re close to Seattle, but it\\'s quiet at night in this mixed residential/industrial neighborhood.  Awesome apartment has everything needed for a visit to Seattle.  It is located within walking distance of at least a dozen breweries (including one, Stoups, directly across the street) and several points of interest. Jeff & Julie left some great info on the surrounding area. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is perfect for day trips to downtown Seattle and surrounding areas, and relaxing evenings in the Ballard/Fremont area.  I have had multiple stays here. Always great, never disappoints. Julie and Jeff were great hosts, communicating thoroughly all along the way. The studio was ideal for me,  and I loved all the small touches that made it feel like my own private hotel. The location was quiet at night, but close to so many things. My co-workers from Seattle were very impressed when they saw it. The snacks were a thoughtful touch, especially the cans of soda water in the fridge. This is a special place to stay, and I hope to come back! My girlfriend and I stayed here while we celebrated our 2nd year anniversary in Seattle. We never met our hosts, but Julie was an excellent communicator and the space was perfect. We appreciated the wonderful snacks and coffee very much. My girlfriend and I felt very cozy, safe, happy, and warm (both the vibe of the space and the temperature). There were plenty of places within walking distance and we never had a problem walking at night together. Everything was excellent and I hope that if I ever need another place to stay that I can come back here.  Eco-friendly has never been so stylish or more comfortable! One look at this house and you can see that being environmentally conscious does not mean you have to give up on style or comfort. The Zero-Energy House is designed to reduce wasteful energy consumption while at the same time create a warm and inviting (not to mention healthy) living environment. From the light-filled spaces to the cleverly designed toilets, this home is a true delight - a perfect reflection of its owners Eric and his wife Alex (and don\\'t forget Beatrice the puppy), who are just the most wonderful and welcoming hosts! Not only are they passionate about sharing their home and building green, but we also came to find we had quite a lot of other interests in common - food, travel, outreach, etc. I dare you to leave this house without feeling inspired!  It was great meeting Eric, although we didn\\'t meet until we were just checking out. Unfortunately we didn\\'t get to meet his wife or their awesome puppy (he showed us a picture) who was totally quiet all night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is amazing. Brand new, clean and very interesting in all of the creative ideas that they used to save energy and materials. We definitely left trying to figure out what we can incorporate into our own home.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will absolutely consider staying with Eric the next time we go up to Seattle!\\r\\n\\r\\n-Drew and Paula\\r\\n\\r\\n I was pleasantly surprised to find eco-friendly accomodations on this site and was very curious to check out the green design of this home.  I fell in love with this place from the moment I walked in.  The house is very spacious, bright, and beautifully designed.  The bedroom was exceptionally large, clean and private, and had it\\'s own bathroom, which featured a water-saving sink connected to an eco-toilet.  Eric and his lovely wife were fabulous hosts, very accomodating, and easy to talk to.  I loved the location and the neighbourhood, it\\'s quiet and close to everything.  I would definitely recommend this place to anybody looking for affordable, eco-friendly, and inspired accomodations! We extended out stay. Glad to have had more time to enjoy Eric and Alex and their quiet, spacious abode.  great location and a great place to stay in Ballard!  Eric and Alex have a super ecco home and it is worth staying there just to get the good karma of living net zero and the health benefits of their conscious design.  Plus the house is very clean and the furnishings are new!  Easy to park your bio-diesel VW or zip-car, but there is no problem if you still own an SUV.  We will stay with Eric and Alex again and we might just stop by to charge our cell phones when the grid goes kaput.\\r\\nfriends of the earth,\\r\\nnancy + mike Though we only were able to stay one night, we enjoyed a spacious and comfortable room and had a great nights sleep. I loved learning about their Zero-Energy House.  Eric was quite responsive and friendly over text and e-mail, though we missed meeting him in person. What a lovely home in Ballard!  We enjoyed the clean spacious accommodations, the quiet neighborhood, and the proximity to all the places we wanted to go.  I wish we had more time to visit with Alex and Eric about the zero energy features of their lovely home - but we had a lot of family to visit.  :-)\\r\\n\\r\\nOur highest recommendations for this Spacious Room! Our stay at Alex and Eric\\'s was delightful. They are a young, creative and absolutely kind couple, and their house is spacious, modern and refreshing. \\r\\nThe neighborhood is very quiet, and our stay quite pleasant. \\r\\nI have to add that while I was there I got a heavy cold, and was coughing all our stay. Not only they did make any comment on my pounding cough, but also while there, they offered my wife the use of the 3rd bedroom so she could sleep without suffering my coughs, with no comments or demands. I thank you guys for that. Staying at Eric and Alex\\'s Zero-Energy House was a tremendous experience. The house itself is beautiful. The photographs do in fact do the house a certain amount of justice but nothing quite compares to actually being in the house. There was a tremendous amount of thought and design acuity put into the making of the house and it was just a pleasure to stay in it. Not to mention, it was supremely clean and just felt incredibly new overall. So it seems obvious that my girlfriend and I were quite satisfied with the bedroom in which we stayed. Lots of closet space and drawer space, and lots of space in general. The windows afforded a nice cool breeze at all times and real nice sheets of fresh natural lighting. And again, supremely clean. The location is tremendous as well. The neighborhood itself is quiet and safe. I didn\\'t rent a car so I didn\\'t really pay attention to whether or not there were any parking restrictions but I really cannot imagine there being much difficulty in finding parking. As for the house\\'s proximity to things to do; my girlfriend was vending at a art/crafts show at Seattle Center and there was a bus stop two blocks away from the house where we picked up a bus that took us to Seattle Center in less than 15 minutes (and once you get to Seattle Center, you can walk, bike, or catch another bus quite easily to other parts of the city like Belltown, Pikes Place Market, the sports venues, South Lake Union, Capitol Hill, etc.). Not to mention, for eating and dining, there are just loads of restaurants and bars within completely reasonable walking distance from the house (5-10 min walks). And finally, coordinating the check-in and check-out with Eric was simple and effortless. Even though we didn\\'t cross paths too frequently, I have no reservations in saying that Eric and Alex are nice, personable people and tremendous AirBnB hosts without a doubt. (I stayed at Eric and Alex\\'s Zero-Energy House for two days and then a day later, for another two days. To help better visualize: I stayed there, Wednesday and Thursday, then found a place to stay in Capitol Hill for Friday, and then returned to the Zero-Energy House for Saturday and Sunday and checked out Monday. So I posted two reviews of Eric and Alex\\'s Zero-Energy House because technically I stayed there on two separate occasions however, for all intents and purposes, my stay on Wednesday and Thursday did not deviate in quality (SUPER HIGH QUALITY might I add) from my stay on Saturday and Sunday; therefore I wrote the same review (see below) for both of my stays just because it felt like one singular experience. Just wanted to post a clarification just in case this review appears twice under the reviews for Eric and Alex\\'s Zero-Energy House. Anyway, the short version is the Zero-Energy House is the best place I\\'ve stayed in via AirBnB.).\\r\\n\\r\\nStaying at Eric and Alex\\'s Zero-Energy House was a tremendous experience.

Eric and Alex were great hosts! Their home is beautiful and our accommodations were very nice. The room was clean, spacious and private. We really enjoyed learning about their sustainable lifestyle, and found it inspiring. It also made us feel right at home to be greeted by their sweet pup! The location was wonderful, close to bus stops and of course the wonderful Ballard area. This was our first time using Airbnb, and it couldn\\'t have gone more smoothly. Eric was very easy to communicate with and responded promptly. I would highly recommend staying at the Zero-Energy House while in Seattle, I know we will keep them in mind for our next trip!  Eric\\'s place was lovely - quiet, clean, and walking distance to everything we needed plus easy parking for Seattle. Although we didn\\'t get to meet he or Alex, he kept in great touch to make sure everything went smoothly. We were in town for a friend\\'s wedding and staying here worked out perfectly. The house and room were lovely. The bed was really comfortable and Eric was very responsive setting up our reservation. I liked all the neat eco-features of the house especially the hand wash toilet. I need one of those. We´ve had a short but wonderful time in this truly special place in Seattle. Eric and Alex are great hosts, especially Alex´s cookies are delicious! We had a fantastic time in Seattle, Alex and Eric were great hosts. Their home is lovely and in an area full of tasty places to eat and drink. They also have a very loveable dog. We would recommend this place to anyone!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Alex and Eric :)\\r\\n\\r\\n This is a lovely and convenient place to stay in Seattle.  The accommodations are simple, clean, quiet and bright and the host is welcoming and pleasant to deal with. It is in the very fun and funky neighborhood of Ballard; easy to travel to and from the airport and downtown.  I spent part of my time as a tourist and part of it visiting nearby friends, so I wasn\\'t at the house except to sleep and shower. Still, it was a place I know I would have been comfortable in if I needed it to use it as more of a home base. I highly recommend this rental. Great hosts, great house, great dog. We have been home for a week and are still telling people about our first airbnb experience. They pointed us in the perfect direction for sunset and dinner, and invited us out to their friends band cd release party. Great Great Great. If you going to Seattle you want to stay here and you want to be close to Ballard.  We were thrilled with our stay. Eric and Alex are super helpful, friendly and responsive, and their house is lovely. The room is bright, spacious and comfortable, and we enjoyed learning about the interesting process they went through to build such a green space.  Eric and Alex were lovely and great in making us feel at home. Their house is very clean and they put so much care into building a very special home. \\r\\nWe were grateful for their accommodating our little dog and his quirks, and we highly recommend them as hosts! What a wonderful house, great neighborhood, and fantastic hosts. Couldn\\'t be better. Absolutely perfect. Thank you so much, Eric and Alex! Highly recommended! Will definitely try to stay there again in the future!  We had a great time staying at Eric and Alex\\'s zero energy home.  We were on a \"stay-cation\" and really appreciated their generosity, friendliness and overall flexible nature!  Our room and the house itself were comfortable and the neighborhood is a nice one: easy going, and walking distance (or by bus) to Ballard and Phinney Ridge, stores, restaurants, movies etc.   We\\'d highly recommend staying with them! I felt welcomed by Eric and Alex.  I would head in or out, meet up with them and touch base or chat briefly.  They were very friendly.  The house was lovely, and my room & bathroom were very comfortable.  Both the house and the neighborhood were quiet.  The neighborhood is residential and within walking distance of bus lines, downtown Ballard and plenty of trendy restaurants.  I would open the windows at night and enjoy the cool night air.  Perfect for sleeping.  To top it off the house is a model in conservation that was thrilling to hear about.  Finally the location was perfect for me since I wanted something near the Ballard area.   Staying in Alex and Eric\\'s environmental house was such a treat. The room we stayed in was awesome and so much bigger than we imagined from the photos and the welcome we received was the perfect start to our time in Seattle. Not only is their house incredible in terms of how it works, but it is also wonderful inside and we wished we could have stayed for longer. \\nCheck in and check out could not have been easier and they were very easy to communicate with. Their recommendations were absolutely spot on and we really enjoyed meeting them and getting to know them and Beatrice, their loveable dog who we wanted to take home with us. We had a great time at Erics beautiful Zero-Energy House, we would stay there again and we can recommend it without any hesitation. Eric and Alex gave us a warm welcome including a tasty glass of wine and a lot of tips, but left us also a lot of privacy throughout our stay. Their house is not just super clever planned and built but very tasteful furnished and decorated with friendly and warm atmosphere. Everything was tidy and clean, the room is bright and spacious, the bathroom is beautiful and was sparkling clean. Ballard is a great and peaceful neighborhood with beautiful little cafes and bus stops in close walking distance. And then of course there was Beatrice, the cute and super friendly dog, we could cuddle when we got up in the morning. Our stay could not have been better in any kind, thanks a lot Alex and Eric for a great airbnb experience!  We felt very welcomed in Eric\\'s house. It looks like on the photos and it had everything we needed. Eric and Alex created a very quiet and peaceful atmosphere. We felt right at home! Great neighborhood and convenient for us. Eric was very welcoming. We didn\\'t spend much time in the house and didn\\'t get a chance to see much of Alex, but Eric was very friendly and we had a great experience. Bea is a wonderful dog. The house is very well-insulated and the quietude helped us sleep well at night. The entire house is comfortable, simple, clean, and clutter-free, though everything you would need as a traveller is accounted for. We enjoyed learning about the home and eco-friendly building practices. The immediate neighborhood is fairly quiet and it\\'s very convenient for public transportation. Love Seattle. We\\'re very happy we stayed here. Alex and Eric set the GOLD standard as Airbnb hosts.  Their thoughtfully designed home is welcoming, restful, comfortable…and spotlessly clean.  It’s a joy to be in the space they’ve created!  They are located in a great walking/running/biking neighborhood, with convenient access to just about any place in the city you might want to visit.  I loved having the chance to briefly get to know them, and their sweet, lovable dog Bea.  I highly recommend a stay in their home. Though we did not have the pleasure of meeting Eric and his wife Alex during our stay at their Zero-Energy House, they were perfect absentee hosts.  Communication leading up to our visit was seamless and we found that everything was as advertise upon arrival.  Though the privacy of an empty house was nice, I would have loved to meet our hosts based on shared interests that were uncovered during pre-stay emails.  \\r\\nThe house is beautiful and the room was ideal for our needs.  Since the \"green\" concept of the accommodations is in line with my fiancée and my personal lifestyles, we felt the house was a perfect fit for us.  The neighborhood is the primary reason we stumbled across the listing and as we thought, the location was ideal.  Ballard has everything we were looking for, but it is also ideally situated for exploring the rest of Seattle.  I truly can\\'t imagine a better place to call home for a few days.   We only briefly met Alex, but our interactions with Eric were very welcoming and helpful. We stayed at the house on the last night of a two week trip so we were pretty tired, but Eric helped us figure out where to eat and how to explore the neighborhood. The space was beautiful, immaculate and comfortable. We lacked for nothing. Eric\\'s home is absolutely beautiful.  He has taken the Airbnb experience to the next level.  On arrival we were greeted by Eric (and his adorable dog, Beatrice) and he made us both feel very welcome.  He had a list of local recommendations, which was really helpful to us.  The suite has been decorated since this picture was taken and now has a dresser and a bookshelf.  It\\'s a rather spacious room, and the bed is wonderful.  We enjoyed having the whole upstairs to ourselves.  We would whole-heartedly recommend this listing and will be coming back ourselves the next time we visit Seattle. I had a great experience at Eric\\'s home. Eric and Sam were very accommodating and helped us with our questions and recommended places for us to go.  Overall it was a great experience! Eric and Alex are very welcoming hosts, able to accommodate us at the last minute. Their net-zero-energy house is both beautiful and inspiring. The bedroom is very comfy, and the neighborhood is very quiet (but close to cool restaurants). Their dog, Beatrice, is a love! Eric and Alex (and Bea) were phenomenal hosts and made our trip to Seattle fantastic.  Their home is absolutely gorgeous and inspiring (with what I think are some of the coolest toilets I\\'ve ever seen).  We loved everything about the neighborhood and our brief time there...it\\'s quite a seductive city!   Our stay was very comfortable, fascinating, and easy.  It\\'s location near Phinney Ridge and Ballard was exactly where we wanted to be.  Loved experiencing a zero energy home and will look forward to learning more about our hosts\\' experience in creating their unique home the next time we\\'re in the neighborhood. This is a lovely quite and cozy room in a very nice part of Seattle. The room was very spacious and comfortable on the top floor, which feels very private and it has its own bathroom just outside the room. It is as nice as it looks in the listing. Eric and Alex are a lovely and very chilled couple and very welcoming. It was my first experience of Airbnb in North America and I highly recommend it! Beatriz, their lovely dog was also very easy going and lovely to have around. Thanks Eric and Alex! This was our first airbnb experience and we couldn\\'t have asked for a better place! Eric and Alex are very welcoming and their dog Beatrice is just lovely. The neighborhood is great (we loved the Ballard Farmers Market) and the house was just amazing - spacious, clean and beautiful interior design with all those details.  We highly recommend to experience this zero energy house! A last minute decision to celebrate NYE with Ballard friends meant I had to rush to find a place to stay. I came upon a zero-energy house listing down the road from where we wanted to be. I contacted Eric and he quickly replied back with a confirmation. Although I didn’t get a chance to meet Eric, he maintained communication with me until we arrived (from Canada) and met his lovely wife Alex and their playful dog Beatrice. We were immediately made to feel welcomed and settled into our very clean and comfortable room. There are no surprises here and although I feel I will only be repeating what has been said before by others, it’s worth saying again. The house is as described. A “green” home designed to conserve energy and leave a very light footprint. This was the first time I had experienced using a grey water basin and was thrilled by its efficiency. Radiant flooring downstairs means my feet are warm by the time we headed upstairs to the beautifully reclaimed wood floors. A warm, bright and big bedroom with strong comfortable bed with a luxurious comforter that kept us warm and cozy throughout the night. The washroom is two steps outside the bedroom door and has all the amenities you need. A relaxed and tranquil environment in a sweet neighbourhood--can\\'t wait to go back. Thank you for the great hospitality! Eric\\'s place was really warm and welcoming. He wasn\\'t home when I arrived, but he made it seamless to get into the home, which was both clean and had everything I needed to get settled in. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe also has an incredible library of hundreds of books with some really cool titles. I ultimately left town earlier than expected, but Eric was really accommodating in adjusting my initial reservation.  Eric was great. The place was perfectly located. Nice and clean. We\\'ll definitely be back.  this home is in a quiet, very walkable neighborhood in northwest Seattle.  I did not have much chance to interact with the hosts as I left early.  I loved their sweet dog, Bea who saw me off early in the morning on my drive back to Vancouver. Eric\\'s Zero-energy home is spacious, comfortable, and extremely clean.  Eric and Alex were gracious and considerate hosts.  I highly recommend this listing, and hope to return!  Eric and Alex were gracious hosts, they made us feel right at home.  Everything was very clean and they made it easy to get into the house.  Their dog Bea was really sweet and welcomed us right in.  The house is in walking distance of downtown Ballard with some great bars and restaurants. I would recommend their house to anyone looking to stay in Seattle. Eric and Alex have a beautiful home with some very neat energy-efficient and environmentally friendly modifications.  Although they were out of town on a trip upon our arrival, Eric made all of the necessary arrangements for us to easily get into the house and settle in.  The house is in a great location, short walking distance to downtown Ballard which has tons of wonderful restaurants/shops.  The house itself is very clean and spacious with a lot of natural light.  I definitely recommend this listing and will be sure to stay here again during future Seattle visits. The listing and pictures accurately describe the home and room/bath.  The neighborhood is quiet yet located 1 block from a bus line and a 15 minute walk to downtown Ballard. An interesting and comfortable space.  Eric, Alex and Beatrice were all friendly, laid back hosts, and gave good suggestions for exploring the area.  I enjoyed learning about their home and future similar projects.  The experience, location and space were a perfect fit for my needs. Thank-you! As first-time airbnb users, my boyfriend and I were lucky to have stayed at Eric and Alex\\'s place. It was very spacious and clean. Also, with all the modern amenities that were available, we were surprised by how there was no difference between traditional and zero-energy house. We had a great time staying at their house in Ballard and it made us re-think about traditional way of using energy.  This was a return visit for us which speaks to our high satisfaction with this home.  Added to our enjoyment this time was meeting Eric, Alex, and Beatrice. We felt very comfortable, had a fun visit and will gladly anticipate requesting staying here for future trips. Eric and Alex were wonderful hosts. We enjoyed sharing clean living experiences.  Access to the house was easy, Eric and Alex were not home when we arrived, but we met up when Miechelle and I returned from walking to dinner. Their dog Bea was really sweet and friendly.   The house is airy, bright and clean.  I would recommend their house to anyone looking to stay in Seattle. Eric and Alex were great hosts! We loved staying in their zero-energy home! They provided us with all the essentials (shampoo, soap, towels, a comfy bed, maps/books, etc.) and they had wifi and a very lovable dog, Beatrice. The listing was very accurate, the house had a great design, and there was an info sheet provided with places to eat and FAQs about the house and area. The neighborhood had lots of great shops and places to eat as well. If you wanted to venture out to another part of the city, there were multiple bus stops close by and it was quite easy to get around also. Overall, we had a great time in Seattle and enjoyed staying in this Airbnb! Back again for a third time. We felt welcome, comfortable and at ease in returning to a familiar place and people. Thank you! Loved Seattle and Ballard was gorgeous. Eric was a lovely host. His place was in walking distance to a lot of breweries. Comfy bed, clean space, friendly dog. Everything was great!  Hosts were welcoming and helpful.  We would have loved to stay longer and enjoyed the extensive library.  Staying in a zero energy house was truly inspiring. We spent 3 nights with Eric and Alex. They were fantastic hosts. The room was very clean and just how they described. They were both very nice and welcoming with clear information and suggestions about the house, neighborhood and city. We would highly recommend them to anyone thinking about going to Seattle.  The room was exactly as pictured - spacious, clean and beautiful! The bed is remarkably comfortable. \\r\\nOur hosts were very welcoming and made it easy for us to come and go for our all of our events and site seeing. The dog, Bea, is a gentle character who simply loves to be pet. \\r\\nWhen we return to Seattle we will book here first.  Lovely home, charming neighborhood, sweet dog, kind and generous hosts made this a delightful (website hidden) was a calm and refreshing experience.Thanks. Eric and Alex are wonderful hosts. We really enjoyed getting to know them. They were very helpful when we asked about things to do in Seattle and Ballard. Everything on the listing is as described. The house is wonderful! Eric and Alex were great hosts!  This was our first airbnb experience and it worked out great!  They were very communicative before we arrived which made arrival a piece of cake.  The house is absolutely gorgeous and very well kept. Our stay with Eric in Seattle was amazing. His home was absolutely beautiful and we were greeted by an adorable dog and friendly host once we got there. Eric was around and eager to tell us about great places to go around town. We would recommend his home to anyone and would be happy to visit again!  We had such a wonderful experience staying at Eric & Alex\\'s place.  It was so convenient and easy.  Their place is inviting, clean, and such a cool space.  And on top of it, they\\'re super nice. Eric was a fantastic host! It was very easy to coordinate our check-in and he was responsive to any questions we had. The AirBNB is probably the nicest house I\\'ve ever stayed at, with a great selection of books to browse and a friendly dog. The house is in a nice neighborhood not too far of a walk from the commercial area in Ballard. Eric\\'s house guide came with a comprehensive list of businesses to check out in the neighborhood. We had a great stay - and would do it again! Eric and Alex have a beautiful, peaceful, very clean home. They were very communicative before our arrival, so we knew exactly what to expect, and what was expected of us as guests. Eric greeted us upon our late evening arrival, and then left us to ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood was very quiet throughout our stay, we woke to almost complete silence! Eric was available for any questions, and we had a nice chat about the home (very interesting!) and their next project.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would highly recommend this home for a stay in Seattle. We were greeted by Alex, who let us in and gave us a quick overview of their beautiful home and city. She was very nice and provided us a great deal of knowledge about the city of Ballard. Their house was extremely unique and really made for a neat place to stay. Would love to stay here again! We had a great time in Seattle and at Eric & Alex\\'s place. It\\'s a beautiful home and they made the stay really easy. Beatrice is a lovely dog too!  Our stay at Eric and Alex\\'s home was very nice. A clean, comfortable room and bathroom awaited us in this contemporary home. Eric was very kind to us and interested in our stay in Seattle. Key box made arrival very easy and convenient.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGreat experience - highly recommend!  Eric and Alex were absolutely incredible hosts! They were responsive, considerate and caring during my stay at their beautiful home. It was a pleasure to stay there and it certainly won\\'t be the last time I visit! We had a very comfortable stay in Ballard at Eric and Alex\\'s home. The house is beautiful and Eric, Alex and Bea the dog were very welcoming. There were nice shops and restaurants within walking distance from the house and a bus stop just at the end of the street to get into the city centre easily. We would certainly stay here again if/when we return to Seattle. Thanks for having us and for the tasty oatcakes! Staying at Eric\\'s place in Ballard was great. It\\'s a very nice, comfortable, and super cool house! The location is pretty walkable too, which was really nice. We wish we had been able to spend more time with Eric and Alex, but we would love to stay again next time we are in town, and we would definitely recommend staying with them to anybody visiting Seattle.  I know I was extremely lucky having such a positive experience for my first Airbnb stay. Eric and Alex were so gracious and their new home is very nice - loved the energy efficient designs! The accommodations were perfect for my needs - private bathroom and bedroom - and the location was close enough to downtown but also offered some great shops and restaurants in close proximity. Their dog Beatrice was quite the charmer too! I will definitely be back with my husband on our next weekend getaway to Seattle! We loved this place and the neighborhood. The house was peaceful, quiet, and super-clean with a great, friendly pet dog who seemed suspiciously guilty at all times. Eric and Alex were excellent welcoming hosts who made us feel at home.  Their restaurant recommendations were top-notch.   Would definitely recommend! Although my partner and I weren\\'t in the house a majority of the time, we appreciated the small notes Eric and Alex left for us when they were gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very welcoming, clean and beautiful house. All the amenities mentioned on the listing were there and their neighbor were very friendly and approachable.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir house had a pretty central location in Seattle and there were alot of great restaurants/cafes in the area. I would highly recommend this place for anyone visiting the Seattle area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you Eric and Alex for a phenomenal Airbnb experience :)! The room and home were clean and very nice. \\n\\nI would recommend this to a friend. My stay at this place was great. Eric responded in a timely manner to all my queries. The place itself was clean, well-maintained and in an excellent location in Seattle. Eric was also helpful in letting us know where to go and what to do. His wife was kind enough to share her food she cooked with us too! Overall, it was an awesome place to stay. I\\'m definitely coming back here the next time I visit Seattle.  This rental was not the neighborhood craftsmen charmer we expected as it fronted a very busy city street.  Consequently family sleeping in bedrooms on the main floor of the house had difficulty sleeping because of traffic noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kitchen on the main floor of the house had one electrical outlet.  It has a dishwasher, but the plates in the cupboard are too tall when loaded normally into the bottom of the dishwasher.  Also the house is listed as having room for twelve, as it does, but there were not enough dishes and glassware for twelve.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main floor of the house is pleasant and the view is stunning.  However sleeping quarters in the basement are less than pleasant.  One bed was simply a box spring and mattress setting on the floor.  The carpet in the basement was dingy. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was great to have internet access and television.  The hot tub was something we did not use.  In fact we turned it off because it had a loud motor running constantly.   My wife and I stayed with friends who were visiting from out of town. Jeanette\\'s place ended up being a great home base for rediscovering Seattle. The place is right off a busy street so be prepared as one room is a little noisy. The grill and hot tub on the deck overlooking Ballard and Freemont easily made up for it! Thanks Jeanette! This was a great house for our reunion. Jeanette was super helpful, would definitely rent again! Nice place. Host was responsive to our questions. House was clean and had everything we needed, accept no toaster.  Would have been goo to know about narrow twisting stairs to the basement, and the downstairs bathroom was quite interesting!\\r\\nNeighborhood was nice but quite hilly.  Good thing grandma and grandpa in their 80\\'s were unable to come.  The rest of us had a good workout coming and going. Ian and Jeanette were communicative hosts who were very easy to work with. They even let us check in early, which was very nice since we had luggage and groceries that we were eager to store.\\r\\n\\r\\nPros: Great location; lovely, sunny deck with great view and a hot tub; Jeanette & Ian are communicative and low-stress hosts.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons: Small downstairs unit with an awkward layout - not the best for privacy or luxury atmosphere; issues with water pressure (maybe because we were using the washing machine at the same time?); on a busy street, so the main floor bedrooms were loud.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall: I recommend this place for a large group of people on a budget, who did not care about having luxury accommodations. The house is clean, and the main floor is spacious enough to have everyone hang out up there. But, if you\\'re looking for a fancy party pad, this is not it. Jeanette and Ian were great hosts, and very communicative. \\r\\n It is our first time using airbnb and we had great time in this cool house!\\r\\nThey have pretty much everything you will need in a house, just very comfortable! We have total 9 people in this trip, and this house have more than enough place for us to hangout&sleep!\\r\\nHost are very helpful and friendly! Overall experience are outstanding:)\\r\\nWill definitely come back again for the next Seattle trip!!! Ian was great! Very responsive to all of my million and one questions. The house was very clean upon entering and had plenty of resources on things to do in the city. The place was spacious and comfortably fitted all of our friends.  The house is on a steep hill in a quiet neighborhood but close in driving distance to get to everything we needed. The hot tub on the patio that overlooks the city is breathtaking - I could spend hours hanging out there.  Ian and Jeannette were great hosts. They were very accommodating to my wedding party of 12 people! I didn\\'t stay in the house myself, but everyone in my wedding party said the house was great - clean, exactly as described. Would recommend it for another large party! This house had ample space, fun games to play, and a great patio with amazing views.  We had small children with us, and the one downside is that it was on a pretty busy street.  However, the area is quite nice.  We were even able to walk to the zoo This home was truly a beautiful home, and was what was described in the listing.\\r\\nThe location of the home, however, left much to be desired.  The street noise was very loud, making it hard to get a good nights sleep.  The stairs to the downstairs were extremely steep and hard to maneuver, if there is someone elderly staying there.\\r\\nOtherwise it was in a great location, and had plenty of space for our family gathering. A truly beautiful place. The views on the deck were stunning (both day and night), the house is charming, and the rooms were all comfortable and clean. We were happily surprised to find more sleeping options than expected, given both beds and futons. This is no small thing, since we had a full crew of 10 people. We didn\\'t do much cooking, but the kitchen was spacious enough for several people to be in at a time to set up snacks and mix drinks. It was an excellent place for our out-of-town guests to get to relax and mingle before heading to our wedding the next day. The house is also  close to fun and walkable area of Fremont, which was convenient.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur hosts were also very accommodating with an early check-in and a later check-out, which was much appreciated! Everything was as depicted in the pictures.  The place was beautiful and the deck had an amazing view.  The owners even texted me to let me know that the house was ready to check in a couple hours before the listed check in time.  The only thing that was a bit unexpected was the layout of the house.  It almost seemed like the downstairs is one long hallway with bedrooms and a bathroom along the way.  I expected there to be a larger common area with a house that sleeps so many.  Overall though, it fit our needs perfectly. Amazing hospitality The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Emiliya\\'s room is very pleasant, very comfortable, and is in a great location. Ballard is one of Seattle\\'s up-and-coming districts and Emiliya\\'s house is a 10/15-minute walk away from dozens of excellent restaurants and interesting stores. Overall, this is very good value accommodation for the price. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe only stayed one night at Emiliya\\'s place, but she did everything she could to make us feel welcome and help us get around. We particularly appreciated the fact that she let us use her parking spot for several hours after we had checked out, so that we could hang around Ballard for brunch before leaving town. The reservation was canceled 33 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Great experience! Host was very friendly and hospitable, and the room was very clean, quiet and comfortable. Emiliya was a great host and the room was clean and nice. It was also in a good neighborhood. Perfect location, lovely art everywhere, private and clean room just as advertised. Emiliya is a wonderful host and I look forward to a future stay.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Emiliya! Was just what I needed. Emiliya was a gracious host to my two out of town guests. They felt at home and loved her morning coffee service. The room was quaint and the location perfect for ease of getting around Ballard. A sweet little spot within easy walking distance from downtown Ballard.  Emiliya was welcoming and kind, and the accommodations were homey and comfortable.   Really nice place to stay especially if you appreciate tasteful paintings. Great location if you like Ballard, have a car (easy and free street parking) or don\\'t mind taking the bus to go downtown - which runs all the time. Great experience overall Emiliya was so very accommodating to my sister and I. We just needed a quick place to stay for the night on our way out to the Cascades and Emiliya could not have been sweeter about our very* late arrival and super early start. Day break french press coffee and fruit!!  It was fantastic and you were a great host. I appreciate you being communicative and all the goodies you left out were very considerate. I can\\'t recommend you more highly. 5 stars.  I was in this cute city for the summer internship at Amazon. With completely zero knowledge of this city, I came in around 10 P.M at night. You got your own room with private bathroom. Everything is just there and I actually like how she put the bed in the corner with windows right next to it. Just image woke up in the charming-May-morning-of-Seattle, the first thing you would ever feel is the gentle breeze! Emiliya is a super friendly and easy-going lady. She helped me with everything I need and explain to me with great patience. I loved this place, right off the intersection of 15th and NW 60th street. I kinda enjoy walk for eight minutes to Leary and hop on a bus #40. I moved out to U district after my lease ends. Will absolutely miss this place! So if you are a future Amazonian or your company is located in the south lake union area, I would definitely recommend this place! Emiliya was a thoughtful host.  It was hot during our trip and she left us water bottles to use while we were out.  The space was as listed and perfect for two.  An added bonus is that her artwork is truly beautiful!  I would recommend this listing for sure.   Emiliya was a wonderful host! She was extremely flexible, allowing me to pick up the key and drop off my luggage for an early check in when I arrived in the city in the morning. Her place is on a quiet street, which I prefer, and bus stops and Market Street were still very accessible. Emiliya also offered to make coffee and breakfast in the morning. My sister and I had a lovely stay in Emiliya\\'s home and would definitely stay with her again in the future. Emiliya\\'s place was very convenient for me to visit family and to visit the Ballard and Freemont areas and to take the bus to downtown Seattle. Very close to bus stops, the Ballard Market and coffee shop, downtown Ballard, and the Sunday Ballard vegetable market. The perfect place to stay while visiting Seattle!  This was our first airbnb experience and it was great! The room was very comfortable and the location was amazing. Our host was great at checking with us through text messages and make us feel welcome. We barely saw her because we came in late at night and left early in the morning, but she was very sweet and we will definitely recommend her :)  Perfect! Easy check in, with no issues. Comfortable place, very clean. Beautiful artwork, too! Emiliya is a gracious, thoughtful host.  Her home is bright & cheerful; she is an accomplished artist and her creativity and talent are nicely showcased in her living space!  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is wonderful. It\\'s a short walk to many of Ballard\\'s fun shops & restaurants, and public transportation is nearby. \\r\\n\\r\\nI had a great stay, and hope to return again!\\r\\nI \\r\\n This was my first experience with AirBNB and I was not disappointed at all. Room was nice and cozy. Had a lot of well done paintings which created a nice atmosphere. Emiliya was a very nice host who was always making sure I was comfortable. Overall a great experience. \\r\\n\\r\\n Our stay was very pleasant! Our room was beautiful! We would definitely like to return. Hey Emiliya,  Thank you for being my first Airbnb host.  Your place was perfect for my needs.  I was able to be located near the venue where my niece was getting married, and also near enough to where the rest of my siblings were staying.  I loved the room, the art on the walls, the fan in the window cooling the room, the private bathroom.\\r\\nYou were a friendly and welcoming host, and making your home available to me was considerate and special, though I didn\\'t really take advantage of the kitchen area.  I hope you liked the tomatoes from my garden.  If I was to come back again, I would definitely call you up and be your guest again.          Dave Berens Beautiful art, a nice clean bedroom with a well stocked bathroom met all our needs for the stay.  In the morning a great cup of coffee was a good way to start our last day in Seattle.  We came in late and left early since we were cramming our time with activities, so not much time to interact with Emiliya.  Her place is waling distance to many good places to eat.  Try Morsel for breakfast on 15th and 60th. Emiliya was a very welcoming hostess & very responsive to any questions that I had. I stayed with her for a few days on a solo trip to the PNW & felt very safe. This was also my first time using airbnb. It was super easy to take the bus downtown & to walk to all of the restaurants/shops in Ballard. I would highly recommended staying here. We had a wonderful stay with Emiliya. We arrived after spending six hot days in Portland (which we loved). We were happy to see that we had our own private room and bathroom attached. The bathroom is fully stocked and the room includes a big closet to hang clothes as well as hide away your luggage. There is also a fan in the window, which made for relaxing, cool nights and evenings. This is a shared space so the rest of the home includes Emiliya\\'s things including tons of beautiful paintings so please be respectful. \\r\\n\\r\\nEmiliya is a fantastic host. She was quite busy painting, but still made time to chat with us and make us feel at home. She made coffee for me that was super yummy. We were allowed to use her kitchen and things to make breakfast and even decided to cook dinner one night after many days and nights eating out. Because of our lengthy travel she was even kind enough to let us do a load of laundry. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of the location, Ballard is a bit of a haul from the downtown area. HOWEVER, exploring Ballard and the marina was one of my favorite parts of our stay. There are so many great restaurants, cafes, and shops in Ballard. You have to check out Golden Gardens!!!!! We ended up using car2go to get around the city a lot. Fremont, Green Lake, Capitol Hill, etc. It was all very beautiful. I really fell in love with Seattle and have Emiliya to thank for a relaxing home base for all of our explorations.  The Ballard Artcove was a recommended listing at the bottom of the screen.  I usually choose \"entire place\" listings however this seemed truly private (located on the top floor of a condo).  Pictures were okay and previous reviews were complimentary.\\r\\n\\r\\nA week or so before arrival I messaged Emiliya to inquire about public transportation from the airport to her home since we were not planning to rent a car.  She did not know the immediate answer and I was able to figure it.  She did eventually message me with a helpful website.  A day or so beforehand I messaged her to clarify check in time.  Contradictory information was listed and I wanted to make sure it would be okay to check in at 1 pm after our long travel time.  Emiliya messaged that it would be fine, the room would be ready and told me how to get the key.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoom was located easily, smaller than I expected, but seemed satisfactory at first glance.  We were exhausted. Unfortunately when I pulled back the bedspread, I noticed a large reddish brown stain.  This led me to take a closer look at the sheets.  Upon doing so I discovered multiple places where a dried mucus like substance was visible and some had crusted onto the sheet.\\xa0 I stripped the bed down to the white mattress cover and decided to wash the linens.  This seemed like a quick and easy solution.  There happened to be a 2nd set of sheets in the wash that fit the bed we had reserved.  I texted Emiliya to let her know that we had found the room easily and that I had switched the sheets due to the condition of the set on the bed.  This led to a number or texts from Emiliya filled with exclamation marks and language that began to attack my character.  \\r\\n\\r\\nKeep in mind, I have never met this woman in person & now found myself in what seemed to quickly be becoming a confrontational situation.\\xa0 This put me under a tremendous amount of stress and we began to notice other things in the room and bath that didn\\'t seem to have been cleaned.  Discomfort doesn\\'t begin to cover the emotions I was feeling.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis trip had been in the works for over 2 years.\\xa0 Very limited funds meant our budget was well thought out.  We planned all of our exploration and sightseeing around the areas we chose for housing, intending to walk or take inexpensive public transportation.\\xa0As a result, our housing and transportation expenses more than quadrupled.\\xa0 What was supposed to be a relaxing start to our vacation was unsettling, unnerving, and filled with anxiety because of a set of unclean sheets that I was happy to wash. \\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very uncomfortable recommending this listing.\\xa0 After my initial request to Emiliya for a full refund, she issued a partial amount.  I declined and made a 2nd request through Airbnb resolution portal and was issued a full refund. We have nothing but kind words for Emiliya. She is beyond hospitable as a host and we loved interacting with her. My daughter can\\'t stop talking about Emiliya and how great she was. The room and arrangements were perfect and the area was close enough to downtown Ballard and away enough from the busy Seattle city life. I can\\'t recommend this enough. Excellent! A lovely room in a lovely house well located in a great neighbourhood, it was exactly what we need.  Emiliya was an excellent host! MY girlfriend and I stayed with her for a month while we searched for a permanent place and jobs in Seattle. She was very accommodating and made us feel very welcome and at home. Her home is lovely and filled with her beautiful paintings. She gave us free use of the kitchen and offered us storage space for our things beyond the room we rented. The apartment is in a very good location with many great local restaurants within walking distance. The bus stop is a 2 minute walk away and its about 30 minutes to downtown by bus. All in all Staying with Emiliya was an excellent experience. We couldnt have asked for a kinder person to stay with while establishing ourselves in a new city. Excellent room, lovely host, great location. Quiet, clean, comfortable. I needed a room near my daughter\\'s house in Ballard and Emiliya\\'s home fit the bill. I had a little bit of trouble with the lock box, but that was my fault and not hers. The room on the third floor was perfect in all ways, very clean and comfortable. Everything was as it was described on the listing. One small issue was that the water in the bathtub drained quite slowly; but that will be easily fixed. The neighborhood was ideal for me. I look forward to my next stay with Emiliya. She is a wonderful host. Emiliya was a wonderful host. She checked in a couple of times to ensure that everything was in order before we moved in. She was very prompt in responding to questions as well. The neighborhood was very enjoyable as well!!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very comfortable experience!! The cottage was very modern and cool. Perfect for my needs and Errin was great. This is a good jumping off point for Ballard restaurant and coffee shop ++ scene and Shilshole touring and excellent transportation downtown. Huge deck and hot tub are a plus for warmer months. \"My girlfriend and I stayed in Errin\\'s Mini-Home for a long weekend and had a great experience. The Mini-Home was very efficient, tidy and well-done. It had nice amenities and was the perfect place for a couple for the weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nErrin was very friendly and accommodating, and made our stay very comfortable. She was ready to answer any questions we had, and she even left some breakfast items for us in the fridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe really enjoyed the Ballard neighborhood as well. Within a 15 minute walk from the Mini-Home, there are lots of nice shops, restaurants and bars. The location is a little bit north of Downtown Seattle, but we were able to take a bus into Downtown and to access other parts of the city.\\r\\n \\r\\nOverall, we had a great experience and would recommend Errin\\'s Mini-Home to future guests!\" Errin\\'s \"Mini-Home\" was absolutely perfect for my stay. Parking available right in front-\"Free\". Walking distance to food or shopping. Only 15 min. drive to downtown Seattle. She was always available for any questions but I always felt extreme privacy during my stay. Don\\'t forget to ask about her Pizza!!! Highly recommend Errin & her \"Mini-Home\" for your stay near Seattle! We really enjoyed Errin\\'s \"Mini-Home\"-- The location is very convenient for us--so close to family for visits.  Easy to use the bus system too!  We really like the Ballard neighborhood--very walkable and friendly.   Parking is on street.\\r\\nEverything you need for a great stay is thoughtfully provided.   The unit is sparkling clean, very well appointed, and you will enjoy the privacy.  Wireless works well as does the TV.\\r\\nThe  unit\\'s double-size bed is located in the loft --which is accessed with a sturdy loft ladder that pulls out when in use--and stacks back against the wall when not in use--a great solution!.  \\r\\nOriginally, I was a little concerned about navigating the ladder--especially for nighttime visits to the bathroom.  However, I had no problems--even with a slightly bad knee.   \\r\\nThe kitchenette was very serviceable--the small (under counter) refrigerator works well and is large enough to easily hold a half-gallon of milk on the door.  The bathroom includes a large neo-angle shower.  Hot water is on-demand and worked well.  \\r\\nWe will definitely stay again!  Kudos to Errin for sharing the Mini-Home--makes staying in Ballard a breeze! I absolutely loved the stay at our piece of Seattle in the mini home graciously hosted by Errin! We enjoyed every aspect of this quaint place. Perfect on street parking, without the hotel prices equivalent to the cost of the stay. We loved strolling the neighborhood and happened upon a perfect pub a block or two away. I recently had to drive through seattle there and back in one day and cried passing the famous exit because I really had wished I was staying the night and especially the memories that come with Seattle Minihome. This is perfect for a couple with a small child or a business traveler. I am so found of this design and even took a tour video for my montage of our trip. We were surprised with treats and greeted by Errin to get the ins and outs of the how to work it. The space is perfect quite and quaint. I do not want you to look for any other rental because Errin\\'s home has it all!   This was the second \"weekend\" stay we made while visiting our kids who live in Ballard.  We came in one weekend, left during the week, and came back the next weekend.  Each stay was three days.  (I reviewed, in depth, the first stay.  Wanted to be as descriptive as possible so that prospective guests would know what to expect from a \"guest\\'s\" perspective.)\\r\\nThis last weekend did not disappoint!  We really love Errin\\'s place.  \\r\\nThe privacy is wonderful--we were only a short walk from our kid\\'s place and being able to park the vehicle and walk back and forth was great.  If one wants to venture further--without a vehicle--the bus line is only steps away. The Seattle bus system is very efficient, in my opinion.  We\\'ve ridden it all over the city--to the downtown--and even used it to catch the commuter train to the airport.\\r\\nA lot of amenities are packed into a small area--perfect for a couple.  Errin is a great hostess.  I would not hesitate to recommend her place. Thank you Errin and Co. For a lovely stay. The time was perfect for our time away in Seattle. We loved the hot tub, the sun on the deck, and coming \"home\" to the little house. You were oh so gracious and welcoming. The bus was very easy to access and we loved the location, which was close to so many activities. We loved eating your amazing pizza on the beach and strolling it off afterwards.   We will come again! We had such a pleasant stay at the Seattle Mini Home. It was very cozy, clean, quiet and in close proximity to everything. Our host was so sweet and made us feel right at home. I will definitely be staying there again when I travel to Seattle.  Errin was a perfect host. My wife and I had a great stay in her mini-home. It was comfortable, private and conveniently located.   Errin was quick to respond to messages about our arrival and was there to greet us when we made it into Ballard. The mini-home is an adorable place to stay and was perfect for our 4 nights in Seattle. The bus stop was so close and convenient it was a breeze going downtown and back. We reserved our last night for Pizza at Errin\\'s business called Veraci\\'s which was unbelievable! We hope to stay in Errin\\'s mini-home if we can make it back to Seattle in the next year or two. The hot tub was an added bonus as well, we were lucky to have such great weather. This is a great place to stay in Seattle.  Very close to fun shops and great restaurants.  The house is small but has everything you need for a weekend trip.  I wouldn\\'t suggest staying here with more than 2 people but it was perfect for my husband and myself.  Errin really makes you feel at home and even provided toiletries.  Although we didn\\'t get time to use the hot tub, it is just steps from the cottage and  on a beautiful sunny deck. We would stay here again on our next trip up north. Errin\\'s mini home is fantastic! Great location, great host, great hot tub with view of Mt. Rainer! One of my best air bnb experiences. Thanks Errin! We absolutely loved Errin\\'s Seattle Mini Home! It was perfect for  our needs. The Ballard area was so great we barely left!  We stayed for a month in the \"mini-home\"--it was a really wonderful experience all around.  Errin made us feel extremely welcome, and she was always helpful with all of the necessities (towels, sheets, directions, ideas for restaurants and things to do).  And, it is true, you can see Mt. Rainier from the porch.  That is not something we will soon forget!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is key to note--Ballard is ideal if you want to be within walking distance to good restaurants and a cool neighborhood--also close to Carkeek, Discovery, and other parks.  Also very close driving distance to downtown Seattle, UW, Queen Anne, and other spots to visit.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had no problems with street parking, though we walked to many of the places we went.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan\\'t say enough good about Errin\\'s mini-home. We were only in town a few days, and had quite a bit to accomplish in that time.  Errin\\'s mini-home was perfect for our needs.  Our flight in was delayed about 14 hours, but Errin took it all in stride, even though she was far busier at the time than she had previously anticipated.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheck-in and check-out were effortless, the mini-home was very well equipped, and when I asked if salt and pepper were already present, Errin bought them for us (in nice grinders) within a day, along with olive oil!  Errin is highly entrepreneurial, which means she\\'s creative, thoughtful, and responsive.  She also provided an electric radiator--unprompted--when she noticed it was a bit chilly for us (we were coming from a very warm climate).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mini-home is in a great location, with easy access to downtown as well as North Seattle and Shoreline.  There are bus lines on the same block, and street parking was very easy to find, usually right in front of the house or a few car lengths up, day or night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a great place, and we\\'d love to come back! Perfect home away from home. everything you need, bus stop nearby for access to downtown. the neighborhoods is charming and a view of Mt.Rainier- if you are lucky to have clear weather which I did! Errin was totally hands off but available via text if needed.I could not have asked for a better place to stay. I could be outside or in beats a hotel room. I would definitely go back if I ever get to Seattle again. My partner and I stayed for nine days in Errin\\'s summer cottage. We had an excellent stay, both in terms of the home itself and in terms of the location. The home was comfortable and equipped with almost everything you could reasonably expect. The location was convenient for Ballard itself (with its plentiful bars and restaurants) as well as other interesting neighbourhoods like Fremont and Green Lake. Downtown is an easy bus ride away, too. Recommended! Errin\\'s house was wonderful and cozy, and she was very helpful and unfailingly friendly. The outside porch is also a huge bonus. It\\'s also in one of the most pleasant parts of Seattle, several good restaurants in the area, and the wonderful Top Banana fruit/vegetable store just around the corner, which is definitely worth a visit. Whole-heartedly recommend this place. \\r\\n Errins place is amazing !  \\nSo private and comfortable. You will find everything you need. We would go back in a heart beat.\\n Errin\\'s mini-home was lovely. It was very clean, comfortable, and well-equipped. The neighborhood was nice to walk around in, and we easily used public transportation to get to and from downtown and the University neighborhood. We would certainly stay there again! We loved staying in the Ballard mini-home! Errin was an excellent hostess, and the space was just perfect for us. We had a wonderful time and we highly recommend staying here - we hope to be back sometime! The location really worked for us - we were about a ten minute walk from the main part of Ballard, and an easy bus ride to the airport and downtown. Errin really took care of us and made sure we had everything we needed. Stay here if you get the chance! This house was great!  It was private, cozy, and very close to so much!  We were there visiting our daughter, who lives less than a mile from the house.  Ballard is a really cool neighborhood, and we found several restaurants and a very nice grocery store within walking distance.\\r\\nErinn was wonderful...she has made this house a true gem, and we hope to stay there again on our next trip out.  The best part was being able to see the mountain from the patio!  I was so excited by that!  Climbing the ladder to the sleeping area made me feel like a kid in a treehouse. :) The only \"problem\" was that the bed wasn\\'t as comfortable as our own...but we run into that a lot.\\r\\nErinn\\'s restaurant, Veraci Pizza, was really good.  The pizza was just like my husband likes it, woodfired with a thin crust.  We will be sure to visit there again, too!\\r\\nThanks, Erinn, for a lovely home away from home.  Errin was a great host.  We were very very happy with this tiny house at an affordable price in a great location, and recommend it highly to those on a budget. Cute, quaint little home away from home. Had everything we needed for a week-long stay in the area and was conveniently a short block from the D-line bus to Seattle Center. Walkable neighborhood with fun shops to browse off Market St. Thanks so much for your hospitality!  The mini-home is so cute and the hot tub was great!  We had a very nice stay there.  Errin was friendly and easy to communicate with.  She got a baby crib for us to use and had a well stocked Keurig coffee maker.  I would stay here again and would recommend it to friends. Overall great experience. Everything we needed was provided and more. Location was a short (i.e. 5-10 min) drive to downtown Ballard and the Locks. Don\\'t hesitate to consider booking with Errin.  The Mini-Home is great! Errin greeted us on arrival and gave some great restaurant recommendations in the area an showed us around. Her place is private, VERY clean, and comfortable. The D line to downtown and Seattle Center really is just steps away, plus just a short walk to all the Ballard neighborhood places. The hot tub was really nice after a long day of site seeing on our feet. We loved it and would certainly recommend it to others and hope to stay there again on our next visit to Seattle.  The mini home was clean and comfortable. The location was really great, just steps from the D line bus stop which goes straight to Downtown in about  20 minutes. It was also a 15 minute walk from the popular bar and restaurant street in Ballard and a 40 minute walk from the zoo.  The crossfit gym is close by too. \\r\\nErrin was really helpful and friendly. We would definitely stay here again.  It is a lot more personal and more practical than a hotel.  This is a great place to stay in Seattle. Errin’s Mini Home is really clean, well equipped and cosy; it had everything we needed for our 4 night stay. The bedroom is upstairs via a ladder which was really cute and fun, although it did make night time trips to the bathroom a bit of an adventure! Errin was a thoughtful host and even left an umbrella on our porch as the weather was really bad during our stay. The house is in a great location for Ballard, it’s a 15 minute walk to lots of great bars and restaurants and about 10 minutes from supermarkets. The neighbourhood is really safe and in a lovely part of Seattle. The house was only a two minute walk to the bus stop into Seattle centre, which ran every 15 minutes and took approx 35 minutes.  We’d definitely stay here again!  This place was perfect! Very small but had everything I needed, and Errin was a great host. She made sure I had everything I needed but gave me complete privacy during my stay. As others have mentioned, the loft would be problematic for anyone with mobility issues, and if you\\'re staying in the winter, bring some warm clothes, as it takes a while for the portable heater to get the place warm. The best thing about the house is that it was absolutely spotless. I\\'ll definitely stay here on future trips! We had a really great stay, unfortunately one of us became ill during our Settle stay and this was the perfect place to stay warm, comfortable and recover. Very good location, I would recommend blue dog diner down the street for massive pancakes and El Camion across the street for incredible mexican! Would definitely stay again :)\\r\\n This is way better than booking a hotel, as the price is much more affordable and in my opinion, you get way more for your money. We loved having a kitchen to keep our leftovers in after eating out and Errin stocks it to the brim with everything you need and more (coffee, tea, snacks, etc.). It\\'s in a great location that felt like we were close to everything and the street parking was always plentiful - we found a spot out front every evening when we returned. It was also great having the privacy of the mini home to come and go as we pleased.\\r\\nThe upstairs bed area is admittedly a bit tight but worked fine for us, as we\\'re on the smaller side (I\\'m 5\\'3\" and my fiancé is 5\\'7\"). Keep in mind you may have to be a bit adventurous to go up and down a ladder every time you want to get in or out of bed.\\r\\nErrin is a phenomenal host. She\\'s friendly and had the place spotless for our arrival. If we ever know anyone visiting the area, we\\'ll definitely be sending them her way. Not to mention we\\'ll be sure to book this place anytime we decide to visit the city again! The mini home in the Ballard district of Seattle is comfortable, has all the required amenities and is conveniently located near a major street.  Additionally, Errin was the perfect hostess.  She was available if I needed but also allowed me privacy.   I highly recommend Errin\\'s mini home. The mini house is great !!!\\nPerfect location , not far from downtown and surrounded with lots of things to see and do .\\nThe house it self is very compact and private with everything you need .\\nYou do have to climb down the ladder in at night to use the washroom :)  I travel to Seattle often for work and Errin\\'s Mini-Home was a great place to stay in one of my favorite Seattle neighborhoods. It is a cozy little place to yourself close to the bus lines to downtown, walking distance to downtown Ballard. It is a few blocks from Ballard Market, the best Grocery store in town, and there are great restaurants within a couple of blocks. Errin had the place all ready for me when I arrived and was quick to respond when I needed something. I plan to stay in the Mini-Home again! Mine and my boyfriends stay in Seattle was great and the mini home was the perfect place to come home to after long days of site seeing. It was warm and cozy and had all the things we needed to make us feel at home. Errin was very helpful and easy to reach if needed. I would definitely recommend the mini home! I was so in love with this mini-home! Cute, clean, cozy, comfy bed, and conveniently close to food and transit to downtown. Oh, and Errin was lovely and helpful. -Angeline The Mini-home was so cute and provided everything we needed.  Errin was very welcoming and helpful.  Highly recommended! We had an incredible time in Seattle and Errin\\'s mini-home was, not only in a great location but also met all of our needs.  We would highly recommend staying at her place if you ever visit the Seattle area.  We brought our daughter with us and Errin went out of her way to provide us with a pac-n-play for our daughter to sleep in.  One place that we loved for local food was Uneeda Burger ((website hidden)).  Fresh, affordable, and a great environment.  Thanks again Errin and Seattle for helping our family make memories we will never forget!!! This place was fantastic, my parents were in town and i chose this place as it was a quick 3 minute walk from my house. \\r\\n\\r\\nHouse: it\\'s small but incredible cozy and comfortable. The stairs up and down the loft was a bit daunting for parents who are in their 60s, but they got over it after a few tries. Kitchen and Bathroom were both very clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nHostess: Errin was a great hostess, i never get to meet her in person but we were in constant contact days before and during the stay, she gave me a great sense of her presence and support during the stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighly recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\n Quiet, clean, and very cozy. Errin was a great host and her place fit our needs perfectly!  I would definitely recommend staying here! The house was wonderful to come back to after each day of touring the city, and Errin provided us with everything we needed. She was easy to contact and super welcoming. The bed was really comfortable too!  This mini-home was perfect for our stay in Ballard. Errin has thought through every detail and she even provided a pack-n-play crib for our infant! The location was easy to access and street parking was easy to find. In addition, Errin was very accommodating to our late arrival time and made us feel totally at ease! We very much enjoyed our stay at the Mini-Home. We loved the space, having our own little kitchen with fully functioning appliances (fridge, stove, coffee maker, microwave, etc.), a living room, and a separate sleeping area. We enjoyed having our privacy but our host, Errin, was always available to answer any questions we had. Everything was very clean. There is street parking, and it is a short car ride to Seattle, downtown Ballard, or Fremont. We hope to be back soon!\\r\\n\\r\\n My daughter and I were very happy in your mini-home.  We had everything we needed.  The place was clean and tidy.  We loved the neighborhood and easy walk to downtown Ballard.  Having the supply of coffee for our morning fix was an added perk. Thank you so much.   My girlfriend and I really loved the mini home. It was my first airbnb experience and it went great. We didn\\'t get the chance to meet Errin but she was available if we needed her. But we didn\\'t! Everything was as described and stocked. We didn\\'t do any cooking but you could easily make a great meal in the kitchen. We loved getting in the hot tub for a few minutes each night. Ballard is a great neighborhood and there was parking within a few houses of the home. I hope my next experience goes as smoothly as this one! Errin is such a great host and her Mini-Home is neat and well-equipped with everything you need. You will find plenty of coffee, tea and other morning treats in the fridge. Nice neighborhood with plenty of parking places on the street. Will come back. Errin and her daughter were friendly but not intrusive. The little house was neat and clean. The bed was very comfortable. Location was excellent. Having a wall clock for those of us who do not wear a watch would have been handy. We definitely enjoyed our stay !!! This place was in a perfect location for us while we were visiting Seattle. We were only a few miles away from downtown Seattle and everything was easy to get to by car. The mini-home was indeed a mini-home, but it served us well for everything we needed. We did not use the kitchen although it was available to us for use. We did use the hot tub that was available to us which was awesome after walking around the entire day. We would return to the mini-home if we visit Seattle again and would recommend this place to anyone! This was our first AirBnB experience and I have a feeling it\\'s going to be hard to beat! Working with Erinn was absolutely fantastic. My husband and I stayed in her Ballard mini-home while traveling to Seattle the week of our wedding. Booking was easy and Erinn was quick to respond to our reservation request and questions. We met Erinn briefly after checking in and saw her once during our stay. Though we didn\\'t find we needed anything, it was great to know that Erinn was a quick text message away. This cozy guest house does offer a surprising amount of storage space. It was a great place for me, my, mom, and my aunt to get ready on the wedding day (with a photographer capturing it all) and a lovely retreat from all of the festivities. Errinn keeps the mini-house fully stocked with towels, shower supplies, coffee, and cooking supplies. Though we didn\\'t find we needed anything during our stay, it was great knowing Erinn was a quick text message away. Staying in Ballard offers a great local perspective with plenty of coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. Major attractions are a quick ride away. I highly recommend Erinn\\'s mini-home and would without question stay here again. Thank you so much for everything!  Errin was a wonderful host. My boyfriend arrived later than expected, and we were able to get into the Mini-Home without disrupting Errin and her daughter. The home itself is as clean as a hotel and as homey as a summer getaway. Errin provides more than enough of everything. It\\'s as if she really spent time thinking about what a guest might need if they wanted to feel comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso the hot tub was exactly what we needed on our final night in Seattle. The small house was adorable, clean and well appointed, and the Ballard location can\\'t be beat. The amenities were exactly as described and everything we needed was on hand. Thoughtful details like shampoo, conditioner, and soap were much appreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nErrin was a fantastic host -- very accommodating and responsive to any needs we had. We had a late flight out on our last day and she let us stay beyond check out time, which was amazing. Loved her recommendations for the nieghbourhood. Would certainly stay again should we pass through Seattle. Errin\\'s Mini-Home was wonderful and we loved staying there. It was very clean, well equipped, nicely decorated and located in a nice and safe-feeling neighborhood that had a good bus connection to the city centre of Seattle. Mini-Home is also in a walking distance from the center of Ballard which is also a really nice and lively place. Errin was very welcoming and friendly person. We really recommend this place and would ourselves go back if we one day return to Seattle.  Errin has done mini-home RIGHT!! Hospitality and amenities make it the perfect home away from home. It\\'s comfortable in every way, and close to anything we wanted during our stay. We small town folk have anxiety being in the big city, but this adorable place definitely took the edge off. Errin and her mini-home were great.  We enjoyed having coffee on the porch and in the sitting area of the mini-home.  The location is only 9 blocks from Market street and a few more blocks to all the excitement in Ballard.  We had a ball exploring the restaurants, shops and coffee shops within walking distance.  (We love to walk) Coffee, a great fruit market and two grocery stores are even closer.  This is a great spot for exploring Ballard.  Errin checked in to ensure we had everything we needed and made it clear she was easily available via text.  We will use the mini-home again when we come out to visit our boys. An absolute joy! The mini-home is exactly as described (even more awesome in real life!) it is kept VERY clean and in a great location/neighborhood - great for strolling or catching an easy bus downtown. Although we didn\\'t have the pleasure of meeting Errin during our stay, she was only a text away for anything we needed. Everything was as described and expected. Errin was a lovely host and even helped us out with a portable crib for our baby. The location of the mini home was perfect for exploring the City and very convenient. Can recommend it.  If you\\'re looking for the perfect place to stay during your trip to Seattle - stop looking. You\\'ve found the best one. Hands down. Seriously. Stop reading. Book it.\\r\\n\\r\\nErrin\\'s mini home is hands down the best place I have ever stayed. It\\'s surprisingly roomy and Errin has seemingly anticipated every need her guests could have as the place is fully stocked with all the details that really do transform the space into a home away from home.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were probably at our worst in terms of being guests since we were getting married that weekend. Since neither of us live in Seattle any longer, this wound up being home-base. Errin was patient, helpful and generally awesome. The porch outside served as a roomy place for our bridesmaids to get ready. After the wedding when we had a million gift wrappings, empty orange juice bottles - Errin\\'s awesome partner was helping to sort it out for recycling.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also got to work with Errin as the caterer for our wedding and holy moly - everything she touches is golden. We owe so much to her for our wedding being pulled off seamlessly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis place is incredible. Errin and her partner (and her super cute cat) are incredible. Clever, conscientious, clean, comfortable. This place rocks. Book it. Errin\\'s place is very cute and in a nice neighborhood. It is close to bus stops to get into downtown. We really appreciated the coffee and bagels she left for us too. And a soak in the hot tub was lovely after long days of hitting the great places Seattle has to offer.  Errin\\'s mini-home was perfect.  The location was awesome, right next to two main roads but still on a quiet, neighborhood street.  She provided everything you could possibly need--coffee and creamer, pots and pans, even extra toiletries.  We loved having the hot tub to relax in after a long day of walking, too.  The bed mattress was heavenly and the air conditioning was very welcome on a 90+ degree day.  We would definitely stay here again during a future trip to Seattle.  We had a wonderful stay at the mini-home. Everything we needed was available and our host was welcoming and accommodating to any needs. Being by the bus was very useful as well. Great location, perfect space , really hope to stay again:) The mini home was very cute and had everything we needed. You can see and feel the host\\'s love for details to make sure you feel welcome. We enjoyed our stay very much. Thanks again! My husband and I were in LOVE with this mini-home, I want my own in behind my house! The place is cute, bright and has anything that you\\'d need. The location is great, we rented a car and could park easily on the street, but could also walk to dinner, bars, coffee, etc. Errin was very responsive and there if we needed her, but she\\'s thought of everything for the mini home.  Would be happy to stay here again and recommend the place to friends.  The mini-home was the perfect home-base for our visit to Seattle. This compact little space had everything we needed and then some! Errin was a great host and very helpful. The location was great, as it was in a quiet neighborhood not too far from downtown Ballard.  We loved the mini-home!  Errin made us feel very welcome and contacted us before we arrived.  Check-in was super easy and Errin greeted us and gave us some helpful information on where to find places to eat and go out, etc., which was very appreciated!  She then let us be to enjoy our vacation but was available for anything we needed.  The mini-home was just as described and met all of our needs.  We stayed for a week and the little kitchen was great and allowed us to cook breakfast everyday and keep some groceries on hand so we didn\\'t have to eat out all the time.  Errin supplied plenty of towels for us and the bed was very comfortable!  The mini-home is in a nice neighborhood and in walking distance to downtown Ballard with plenty of restaurants and bars if you want a night out.  It is also close to the bus line to take you to downtown Seattle.  Otherwise, it was only about a quick 15 minute drive away.  Parking was always available on the street nearby.  We really enjoyed the deck and hot tub to sit and relax after some long days of walking!  This was our first time using Airbnb, and we were a little skeptical at first, but were pleasantly surprised!  I would definitely recommend this service and mini-home if you are visiting Seattle!  We had a great experience and would definitely come back!  Thank you Errin :) We enjoyed our stay in the mini-home so much that we stayed there twice during our honeymoon. Errin was a great host, very nice and always responsive via text message or the airbnb App.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little apartment is exactly as described, so let me discuss some of the advantages of the location:\\r\\n- a D Line bus stop and an an absolute fabulous greengrocer\\'s (\\'Top Banana\\') are right around the corner, \\r\\n- a great Mexican food place (\\'El Camion\\') is just across the street, \\r\\n- a very good laundromat with very friendly people on NW 65th/7th Ave (\\'Lunar Laundry\\'), \\r\\n- and you\\'ll find the best coffee in downtown Ballard on NW Market Street at \\'ballard bauhaus\\', only a few blocks away. Errin was a wonderful and very very hospitable host. I came a little later than expected and she was super flexible about my arrival. Her little home is a wonderful place for a stay in Seattle. It is close to the city and there are some great restaurants nearby. \\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed my stay with Errin a lot!! If I ever come back to Seattle without having a place to stay, I will most definitely choose her little home again. Thank you Errin for everything, it was a pleasure! We really enjoyed our stay in the mini home! Everything was nice and clean and the mini home is so cosy, you feel comfortable at once!\\r\\nErrin was a great host who was easy to communicate with. She helped us where possible and responded very quick to our questions.\\r\\nGoing downtown from the mini home is very easy and comfortable. There is a bus stop only a few metres from the mini home and the bus takes you right downtown (about 20 min.).\\r\\nWe would always come back and highly recommend the mini home!! We had an amazing at the Ballard Mini-Home! The place was exactly what we expected, with some extra amenities we didn\\'t expect (shampoo, and such). The neighborhood was great- fresh vegetable stands, cute shops, and close to the Ballard Locks. We were 10 minutes away from down town Seattle, and it was easy to get there. Errin was a stellar hostess! Made sure we had everything we needed and then some. We would definitely rent from her again if we are in the area!! Thanks for everything!! This was by far my favorite airbnb experience! Errin\\'s place is true to the photos; it\\'s clean, stylish, and comfortable, and Errin was a wonderful host. She gave us great advice on where to go--I don\\'t think we would have seen all of the great stuff in Ballard without talking to her. The bedding and towels were all crisp and clean, and there was coffee and hot tea for the guests. The place is fully stocked with dishes, pots, pan, etc, and it was just perfect! I Highly recommend and I\\'ll stay at the Ballard Mini Home again if I get the chance! Errin was great and very accommodating of our arrival times. The mini-home was perfect, especially in little details that make a vacation great. Like a large refrigerator, a good wine opener, soft sheets, and a large shower. The neighborhood was a great location too-- a quick drive to pretty much anywhere in Seattle and close to Ballard, Golden Gardens, and Discovery Park. This mini-home has everything you need!  The host was great.  Welcomed me soon after arrival and gave me some good pointers around the area.\\r\\nRoom as very much as pictured and the loft not daunting at all.\\r\\nSuch a selection on cable was awesome.  \\r\\nNothing left wanting in either kitchen or bathroom.\\r\\nGreat location close to Ballard (which is awesome) and a short walk to the rapid ride bus to downtown Seattle\\r\\nSeemed to be a good walking area and a couple of good eateries a stones throw away (or just a 15 min walk into Ballard for a lot of options Better than described. Great spot and Errin is really nice. Errin was an amazing host. The mini home was a perfect place for our first visit to Seattle. We loved the cozy feeling and all our needs were met. We would definitely stay here again if we visit. Thank you so much for your hospitality and for allowing us to have a wonderful experience.  The mini-home is a wonderful place to stay!  Very comfortable and cozy and a great location.   Errin was helpful and accommodating.  A great place to stay!!! Errin was a wonderful host and her mini home is perfectly described and shown in the pictures. Errin was very easy to get in contact with and was willing to be as hands on as needed. The home was very clean and comfortable. The location is decent, it\\'s right around the corner from the D Line bus which takes you straight into the city. Thank you Errin for a great stay! The mini-house was a great place to stay and lacked nothing. Everything was precise and on point and Errin left nothing to be desired about her guest space. Would absolutely come back. Thanks Errin! We had a wonderful time. Errin\\'s mini-home is beyond my expectation. It looks just like it shows in the picture (or much better). Everything is nice and clean. I came around 8 pm and Errin was very flexible about the check in time. We didn\\'t have a chance to meet her though but we communicated smoothly via text. The mini-home has complete privacy if you ever concerned about it. There is a small kitchen with pot and pan where you can cook easy meal. Dishes and silverware are plenty. Complimentary k-cup coffee. I couldn\\'t ask for more!! In the bathroom, she provided several cleaned towels, shampoo/conditioner and soap. It\\'s just like you staying in a good hotel. \\nTips:\\nBallard downtown is about 15 min easy walk. There are many good restaurants located in the downtown.   We had a great stay in Seattle in this mini-home.  The location is great for exploring Ballard with lots of places to eat within walking distance (we had a delicious meal at Delancey).  The mini-home is exactly as pictured.  The bed is very comfortable and we appreciated the keurig coffee maker to help us get going in the morning.   My only regret is that we didn\\'t make time for the hot tub...next time!  Thanks for having us Errin! We had such a lovely stay at the mini home. Errin was more than accommodating. The location is perfect, the space is lovely and efficiently laid out, and check in/out couldn\\'t have been easier. We can\\'t wait to come back.  Errin was very accommodating to all of our needs and concerns. She made sure we had everything we needed to feel comfortable and get the most out of our stay. The mini-house looks exactly like the pictures and was very clean and tidy. The mattress was very comfortable and bathroom was stocked with towels and basic toiletries. It is a very convenient location to all the major Seattle sites and had easy access to great food and attractions.  Thank you Errin for opening your wonderful home to us!  The mini-home was everything described and more. The location was excellent and Errin provided us with everything we could have needed during our stay. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on! I would highly recommend the mini-home to other travelers and would love to stay there again during our next trip. Thank you for a great experience during our first trip to Seattle!  My husband and I loved our stay at Errin\\'s mini-home. The place was very clean and cozy. Errin made us feel taken care of from day one and was also very considerate of our space. The amenities were quality and useful accessories.  Having a mini kitchen provided for lots of home-made breakfasts. :)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis location, nestled in Ballard, was great as well since you could walk to most of the local restaurants and stores. It was conveniently close to downtown Seattle too. It made day trips downtown just as easy as outings to visit other parts of the area. We will definitely recommend to friends and family. My friends and I had a wonderful time staying in the mini home! It is perfect for close friends or a couple. The \"mini\" is no lie, but it is utterly charming! The house is well stocked with towels, linens, and has abasic kitchen--perfect for breakfast before a busy day of sightseeing. Errin was very responsive, and a wonderful host. I would absolutely stay there again the next time I\\'m in Seattle.  Our experience in beautiful Seattle & in Errin\\'s lovely mini-home was just perfect. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay & felt we had everything we needed for a great trip.\\n\\nThank you Errin. Errin\\'s Mini-home was an amazing place to stay at on my first trip to Seattle. It is exactly as pictured and the lighting is bright and inviting. Errin left the key and the door open for us and checked in often to make sure we were comfortable. We wish we could\\'ve used the hot tub during our stay... We loved her place and would definitely come back again!   This Seattle mini house is a wonderful spot for couples. It is fully appointed and in a great location. It is clear that Errin has taken care to accommodate any need that a traveler to Seattle might have. \\n\\nThe hot tub is also a perfect relaxation feature after a long, active northwest day.  Staying at Errins was fantastic. :) The place was perfect for seeing seattle. She was communicative which made checking in and out really easy. If your looking for a home away from home in Seattle this is where I would recommend to stay. Thanks Errin for your wonderful hospitality. A great two week stay here in Ballard, Seattle which is a really cool neighborhood especially down Ballard Avenue (20 min walk). Errin greeted us on arrival, gave us some good tips and helped us get our initial bearings (there was also some bagels left for us, which was a nice touch). The tiny home is small as you\\'d expect but perfect for a short stay, plus there\\'s a hot tub too! \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a little way into Seattle city center, although there is a D Line bus around the corner which takes 30mins to get in. There is also a Enterprise car rental just 8 blocks away if you want to take a road trip too. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall there are lots of nice restaurants, cafes and groceries around here and it is a great base for your Seattle adventure. Would definitely recommend a stay here. Our stay in the mini-home was great. The location let us walk to many things in Ballard. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough we never saw our hosts they had excellent communication with us that made us feel very welcome. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe hot tub was a huge bonus! \\r\\n\\r\\n Errin\\'s house is quite cozy. It is clean and almost includes everything we need. It takes about 35 mins to downtown by bus. Will comeback if  I visit Seattle again! What a great mini home. Super neighborhood, well equipped, fantastic deck and hot tub; it was the perfect Spring Break spot.  Perfect spot for a short stay in Seattle, great neighbourhood, easy to get around the city. Fantastic little home, everything you could need. What a cool house and really great alternative to a hotel! Check-in/out procedure was very convenient and the tiny home had everything I needed. I will definitely try to book here again next time I return to Seattle. Thanks Errin! The mini home was all that we expected and more. It was in a great location with easy access to the city and surrounds. Errin met us upon arrival and gave us a rundown of the local area, she was a great host!\\nWe really enjoyed our stay and we would definitely use the mini home again. \\n\\n-Scott & Adelaide The mini-home was perfect for us during our stay in Seattle. Errin was a great host, meeting us as we arrived and offered any assistance with navigating around or recommendations of places to eat. The mini-home was very clean and cozy and was stocked with everything we could need.  The neighborhood was great with lots of places to eat and shop within walking distance. Would recommend for anyone staying in Seattle! This accommodation out far exceeded our expectations.  It was quant and absolutely perfect for a couple and a romantic weekend getaway!  Erinn was extremely accommodating and the neighborhood was located perfectly outside of the downtown hustle and bustle.  Equipped with a mini kitchen, we were able to get our own fish from Pikes Place Market and have a fantastic dinner in our home away from home.  Staying at the mini home provided so many comforts and an absolutely wonderful & memorable experience.  I recommend this stay to any couple looking for an intimate getaway. We were flying into Seattle very late and our host was very flexible about what time we arrived.  She had the key in the house and we were free to let ourselves in.  We never met Errin in person, but she was on the property the entire time and made it known that we could get in touch with her if we wished.  The house looks almost exactly as pictured.  The kitchen was well stocked, there was complimentary K-cups and everything fit our needs quite well.  Errin also provided shampoo, conditioner, body soap, etc.  She also had a ton of brochures on things to do in the area. The bed was so comfortable!  My fiance and I are average size people; I can\\'t imagine a larger person being comfortable in the loft area.  The only aspect that I was disappointed with was the cleanliness of the house.  The house was very tidy but details like cobwebs and fresh towels under the dishes were overlooked.  Off street parking was also tricky at times.  As far as Ballard, we both preferred Ballard over Seattle.  My fiance and I are more outdoorsy people and the city life isn\\'t for us.  Ballard had some excellent restaurants and was close enough to the airport.   Errin was a very nice and helpful host and responded very fast when we had questions.\\nThe mini-home was well equipped and offered everything we needed for our stay. My wife and I greatly enjoyed our time in Errin\\'s mini-home. It makes great use of the available space and is very functional and well arranged. Errin left plenty of coffee and tea for us to drink, and there are plenty of markets within walking distance for anything else we needed. The location of the min-home is perfect, and there are many shops, and restaurants within walking distance. Anything outside of Ballard is only a short drive away as well. We had no problem finding parking while staying here. The deck was a great place to relax and read a book, and the hot tub provided the perfect way to end a busy day of shopping and sight seeing. \\r\\n\\r\\nErrin was the perfect host. We met her on the first day, but otherwise was unobtrusive to our stay unless we needed something.  We will definitely stay here again if we return to the area! We had a great time in Errin\\'s mini-home. It is a thoughtfully-arranged, comfortable space with everything you need! We loved the natural light and the pleasant evening breezes, as well as the spacious and well-equipped deck (with a great hot tub)! Errin is a considerate, friendly, and responsive hostess while also giving ample space and privacy. Don\\'t miss this gem in Ballard! I would like to thank Errin  for completely making us feel at home. We had to call her for directions from the airport and she was kind enough to stay on the phone with us while guiding us in! We were very GPS challenged at that moment. This was our first AIRBNB experience and I can only hope that other sites are as nice and thoughtful for the guest as this one is. Sincerely Jerry and Nancy Odell This definitely lives up to the glowing reviews! I highly recommend Errin\\'s mini-home to anyone staying in Seattle. It has a wonderful, homey vibe and great amenities, including a hot tub, comfy bed and functional kitchen. Errin left lots of thoughtful touches, including guidebooks, toiletries and even an umbrella for us. We also enjoyed being so close to several fantastic restaurants (especially Bastille and The Fat Hen) and to public transit. In fact, you can easily get in and around Seattle just using a mixture of transit, walking and Uber. If we come back to Seattle, we absolutely want to stay here again! This little Ballard pad is super cool. The location is great. The mini house had that comfortable little cottage feel. The loft was fun.\\r\\nErrin gives you complete privacy. The hot tub is right outside the mini house door, all yours whenever you want it. Great Place. Errin\\'s Mini-House is perfect, everything you need in a vacation to Seattle, confortable bed, practical kitchen, great location, close to restaurant and tourist sites. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf we ever return to the city, we not hesitate to stay in Errin`s apartment again. We had a wonderful stay at Errin\\'s beautiful mini-home!! It is exactly as she says, and perfect for two people (although some of my taller friends would struggle in the loft space!). Errin provides her guests with all of the important necessities- coffee, tea, towels, linens, etc. We loved spending our days exploring Ballard and downtown Seattle, and then relaxing for the evening in the hot tub! It is conveniently located near many outstanding restaurants as well as the rapid bus to downtown. I highly recommend staying here! Thank you for a lovely stay!  Our stay at Errins Mini home was really really good. Located in Ballard it takes you about 15 minutes to go to seattle downtown by bus (we recommend the rapid ride. The bus stop is about two minutes away). Ballard itself offers you many possibilities, so as good Pubs and a Lot of good food.  \\n\\nThe Mini home was clean and cozy. Theres a small kitchen with all the things you need to Cook. The bedroom is.located under the roof. \\n\\nErin was a nice host and she helped us whenever we needed something. Def a great air bnb host Our stay at Errins little home was wonderful! It is exactly as described and very comfortable! Thank you Errin for a great stay!  Errin\\'s Mini Home was adorable. My fiance and I stayed for three nights on our visit to the city, and this space was perfect! We fell in love with the area (Ballard), and Errin was very hospitable and helpful in providing information and suggestions for us, as it was our first time visiting Seattle. \\r\\nShe also is very accomodating, and provided all we could have needed during our stay. She keeps the mini home well-stocked with essentials, and the space is clean and cozy. I definitely reccomend this listing if you\\'re going to Seattle! \\r\\nErrin was the quintessential host and her mini-house was the perfect home away from home. Errin communicated all necessary information in a timely fashion prior to our arrival. She greeted us shortly after we arrived and provided us with an overview of the mini-house. Errin was a kind, knowledgable, and courteous host. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe mini-house is just that: a tiny structure with all the amenities a traditional house has to offer. We cooked breakfast every morning and ate outside on the deck. In the evening we took advantage of the jacuzzi tub after spending many hours hiking. The mini-house is located in the perfect location. It\\'s easy to jump on the highway to head to Mt. Rainer or leave your car behind and take the D line downtown. If you are an exercise junkie, there\\'s a CrossFit next door, Ballard High School (with a track) 1 1/2 blocks away, and a Bikram yoga studio only a short drive away. We will definitely stay here the next time we visit Seattle. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for your hospitality, Errin!!! I enjoyed a great stay at the mini home. Everything I could wish for (and more). It allowed me to be self sufficient but with Errin only a text message away. A perfect stay (with just a minor hiccup with the hot tub). The area felt safe to walk around at night and I would even just walk down to NW Market street for some last minute groceries at the Safeway or Wallgreens. Errin was available by email and text before and during our stay and accommodated our late arrival by having the lights and a/c on and they key waiting for us.  We had several friendly conversations while we were there, and she made a point of getting us fresh linens promptly.\\r\\nThe description of the Tiny House was very accurate, if anything the pictures don\\'t do it justice.  The deck is spacious, the hot tub was hot, the drawers in the kitchen and bathroom were filled with helpful items, and the ambiance was just lovely.  My husband was a teeny bit claustrophobic in the loft, but I could stand straight up in the middle and found it plenty roomy.  The wi-fi worked instantly, it was well-ventilated, and it felt private and safe.\\r\\nThe neighborhood was friendly and peaceful, with beautiful gardens, and located close enough to parks and destinations for plenty of jogging choices.  Parking was a bit of a struggle, but we were never more than a couple of blocks from the house, and hey, it\\'s Seattle.\\r\\nWe definitely hope to go back.   Erinn was great about making sure we had all the information we needed to get to the house and to enjoy our stay. The house itself was beautiful, had all the space we needed and the deck outside was a great touch for being able to enjoy the nice weather Seattle had for us. The hot tub was a great bonus, it helped to perk up a rainy day. The house was walking distance from several stores, and a very easy and convenient drive from downtown Seattle and all its sights. I absolutely will recommend this to everyone I know looking for a place to stay in Seattle.  Errin\\'s mini-home was the perfect little oasis after long days of hiking and exploring Seattle. My husband and I went for our honeymoon, and it was the perfect amount of space for us. Errin was very accommodating; she texted to check that we had everything we needed and provided us with new towels, etc. halfway through the week. The house was really close to many delicious restaurants as well as a bus stop to downtown around the corner. We really enjoyed staying here and cannot wait to come back! I would highly recommend this rental to anyone looking for a cozy, conveniently located rental in Seattle. Perfect mini house for a stay in Ballard/Seattle area. The space is cool with very comfy bed and everything else you need with fully stocked kitchen and bathroom essentials all provided. Everything was spotlessly clean. Errin has great communication before and during the stay with good, clear instructions. Downtown Seattle around 20/30 mins on D Line rapid bus. Run all day frequently so no problem at all. Definitely recommend for staying in Seattle area.  Errin was very communicative and friendly throughout. We absolutely LOVED the place! It\\'s really tiny and cute but exceptionally clean and has everything you need, including toiletries and an excellent coffee machine! Bed was really comfy and the neighbourhood was great, lots of great bars and restaurants. Oh, and the hot tub was amazing! Everything was great!  Would absolutely stay again.  The space was perfect for my wife and me.  Thanks! Errin is very caring, and easy to communicate with. She even had a pack-and-play available for our little one. The place itself is lovely - cozy little house in her backyard with large deck and jaccuzi. Well cared for home, clean - plus I loved the smell of the linen. We really felt at home. Great neighborhoud with a lot of nice placey to eat and easy access to downtown Seattle.  Unser Aufenthalt bei Errin war der perfekte Start in eine lange Reise. Das Appartement liegt ruhig ab von einer Strasse und bietet alles, was man braucht. Sogar Toilettenartikel im Bad und Küchensachen wie Kaffe, Tee und Konfitüre liegen berein. Errin ist sehr herzlich und unkompliziert. Gerne kommen wir wieder! Our stay was wonderful! The mini-home was the perfect base camp for all our Seattle adventures. The kitchen was a great bonus as it enabled us to cook meals. A good supply of coffee was always available and the hot tub was the perfect end of the day unwind. Errin checked in with us several times to make sure we had everything we needed and we felt free to come and go as we pleased. The neighborhood the house is in, Ballard, had so many great food and entertainment options. (try the Golden Beetle, Monday is gourmet mac\\'n\\'cheese night!) We\\'ll definitely stay here again if we\\'re ever in Seattle. Thanks for everything, Errin!! Our stay in the mini-home was wonderful! Errin helped me pull of the perfect surprise trip for my husband\\'s 30th birthday. Ballard is amazing in general and the location of the mini-home is very convenient. We spent a whole day enjoying Ballard, and we would absolutely recommend doing the same! Some of our favorite places in the area were: Morsel (coffee/breakfast), Kiss Cafe (lunch), Ballard Coffee Works (mid-afternoon), Veraci Pizza (dinner), Stoup (brewery), and NW Peaks (brewery). It is also easy to get downtown by taking the bus or an Uber. We would also highly recommend taking a $12 tour of CenturyLink Field - so worth it! All in all, the mini-home had absolutely everything we needed for the two of us and Errin was always just a text message away!  Thank you, Errin, for a lovely stay. The tiny house was perfect for one person for a month. It was very private and quiet, yet only one block from a major bus route and at least 5 good places to eat within several blocks. Only 8 blocks from the heart of Ballard. Errin was a great host and provided everything I needed. The weather was pretty cold occasionally, but the heaters kept the house nice and toasty. I\\'d love to stay here again if I have the opportunity. It was really nice. Much better than a similarly priced hotel. The bed was comfy. Great area too. Ballard is a really cool part of Seattle. Errin was very welcoming and personable!  Her mini home has all your needs met and then some!  I enjoyed having more than a bedroom..the little seating area and TV made me feel like I was home...the kitchenette was stocked with everything you might need for a short or long stay.  I would highly recommend! Erin\\'s mini house was absolute perfect! A nice place to get back to after busy days of meetings and traveling. Everything was there and the house is very clean. Erin replied promptly whenever I had a question. She is very hands off, but there if you need her. If I have to be back in the Seattle area I would definitely visit Erin again if possible. We had a wonderful stay with Theodora in Ballard! She was very welcoming and gave us lots of great recommendations for breakfast, (which we were glad we took) and things to do. He also gave us complete privacy. We had bottled water and all bathroom necessities as well as closet and dresser space to put our things. \\r\\n\\r\\nHer space  consisted of two bedrooms and a bathroom on the ground floor. One of the bedrooms had a single bed, which we didn\\'t need, but we used the desk in the room and the space to put our things. The double bed in the our bedroom was very comfortable and we had a great night sleep. The space was air-conditioned, which was very welcome in the heat. We walked to Ballard\\'s shops and restaurants (about 10 min walk) yet were away from hustle and bustle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a nice vacation! We would definitely stay with Theodora again. This home is so much nicer than appears in photos. The two bedrooms were perfect for our stay. Theodora made sure we had everything we needed. Two thumbs up!! Oh and there\\'s an awesome taco shop across the street.  This is good experience for me to first time using Airbnb, i arrive Seattle at early of morning and Thea just wait me at home although normal check in at afternoon. We have 2 rooms with provide bathroom, Thea also give us introduce of the attraction place nearby, thanks Thea. My friend and I were desperately looking for a place to stay during a busy week in Seattle. Luckily we stumbled upon Thea\\'s and Bruce\\'s condo through the website. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condo is structured with the master bedroom/kitchen/living area are on the second floor while two bedrooms and a bathroom are on the first level. We were greeted graciously by the hosts Thea and Bruce and their cute dog Sophie! One bedroom (the one i used) had a twin sized bed, a desk and a tv. The bed was a little small for someone of my stature but regardless i had a great night sleep. The only critique i could have for the room was that this room probably needs black out curtains if you are someone who is easily woken up by the sunlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other room had a double bed, storage/closet space with blackout curtains. Because we came in August the weather was phenomenal and during the night it was perfect temperature for sleeping.The bathroom and bedrooms were all very clean, and Thea provided towels when needed. \\r\\n\\r\\nBallard has to be the nicest neighborhood within Seattle. It had so many foodie restaurants, bars and options for the weekend. The condo was less then a mile away from the main street.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall the experience was amazing, i would highly recommend using Thea & Bruce for your Seattle vacationing!  Our stay at Thea\\'s home was wonderful! She was unable to be there but had Leslie and Jason look after us! They were full of great recommendations for eats and local finds. They even came to our rescue after locking ourselves out! \\r\\nThe home was just as pictured, clean and well kept. Please don\\'t let the twin bed discourage you! It was super comfy! \\r\\nThere is plenty to do within walking distance and we felt very safe just walking around even after daylight hours. The city is just a short ride away! We enjoyed our stay very much and can\\'t wait to go back! Theodora was a lovely host arranging our arrival even as she flew home from Europe. She is helpful and knows the neighborhood well enough to recommend two great places we could walk to for breakfast. The two bedrooms and bathroom are small yet comfortable and private. Theodora has a great spot in Ballard! It was an easy commute to downtown with a great coffee/breakfast spot on the way. The room was nice and new. She was super communicative and easy to reach when I had questions.  Very cosy space, exactly as described and what we were looking for. Great neighbourhood and easy to get around Ballard and get downtown on the bus. Peggy was a lovely host and we enjoyed her hospitality immensely! Peggy\\'s upstairs private bedroom and bath couldn\\'t have been more perfect for my boyfriend and I\\'s Seattle stay. She provided us with things to see and do in the Ballard neighborhood, and was a friendly face every time we came and went. She had coffee and snacks for us and was easy to communicate with via email and text. I would highly recommend staying with Peggy to anyone and would love to come back the next time we visit.  Excellent little place to stay! Clean, quiet, easy and cute! Keypad was easy for entry. Great use of space! Great location and close to good shops, bars and restaurants.  Thanks Melanie & Brian for a wonderful stay! Everything was incredibly well organized and ready when I got there. Your open and timely communication was just icing on the cake! Melanie and Brian\\'s place is the perfect spot for a fun weekend in Seattle. Check-in was smooth and easy, the room was clean and the location is great! Hope to return at some point! Comfortable. Quiet. Great location. Good value. Had a great time at Melanie and Brian\\'s! Clean, quaint, quiet, bright. We rode our bikes all through Fremont and Ballard from there. Awesome stay!  Melanie and Brian\\'s cottage is great! It is super cute and is in a great location. (Not far from coffee shops, restaurants, and Trader Joe\\'s!) We also found it very easy to use as far as coming & going, parking, etc. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone staying in the area! Melanie and Brian are very accommodating.  This was a great stay! Melanie and Brian were very easy to get in touch with and the guidelines for the cottage were straightforward. We arrived very late at night so they keypad lock made our arrival easy for all. Gravy the Golden, who we met on our last day, is just delightful and filled our doggie fix since we left ours at home.\\r\\nThe cottage is very private (tucked behind the main house) and quiet and the inside is neat and clean. We found the bed comfortable and used the electric kettle for tea several times. The bathroom has a toilet, sink, and shower with great water pressure. \\r\\nThe cottage is in a great location, a quiet street just a block or so from a little breakfast restaurant and also a bar with tasty food. For people like me who inevitably forget to bring several things, Fred Meyer is another couple blocks away. There is plenty of free street parking in front of the house. Just a short walk, ride, or drive to anywhere you might want to go.\\r\\nThis was perfect for our needs (house hunting in the surrounding area) and we would absolutely stay again!\\r\\n Our 3 day stay at the cottage was very nice. It is clean, convenient to pretty much everything, quiet, and totally worth the value.  The bed was comfortable, space just right for 2, bathroom was nicely supplied w/ toiletries and enough towels for our stay. Melanie was easy to communicate with throughout. Instructions were straightforward and appreciated the ease of the key coded door. Would stay again. Thank you!  Thank you Melanie and Brian for a very nice, comfy stay. I enjoyed the cottage. It looked exactly like it did in the pictures and Melanie, your description of the neighborhood and room is spot on. The cottage interior is very fun and inviting. Everything was clean, both inside and out. I liked the neighborhood; it had lots of places to walk to. I will definitely let me friends know about the cottage if they are traveling to Seattle. Thanks again for a lovely stay. :) We had a great time in the Modern Ballard/Fremont Cottage. They were super friendly, hospitable, and it was a great location for accessing the city. \\r\\nEverything looked just like it did in the pictures, neat, clean, new and bright. We stayed 2 weeks while visiting our daughter in the area. The owners were very helpful even if we never saw them! They answered our questions promptly via email. The area is very quiet and the perfect Seattle weather made this trip unforgettable.  The cottage was awesome and central to everything! Great hosts. I would recommend to anyone looking for a quiet stay in seattle.  We had a great experience staying at Melanie and Brian\\'s place. The room was clean and adorable and the backyard is quite charming. Melanie and Brian left us local beers, chocolate, and other snacks, which we enjoyed. We also used the bike that comes with the place one day during our visit. Their Golden Retriever Gravy is friendly and we enjoyed saying hello to her when we walked by the main house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location was perfect. I was in town for a meeting and was able to get downtown easily. Ballard is also a close walk and we enjoyed the stroll that direction to check out the cute shops and restaurants. This was our first Airbnb experience and we really enjoyed it.  Melanie is a great communicator and very responsive before and during our stay. Instructions to enjoy the cottage was clear. We arrived quite late in the early hours of the morning due to flight delay.  Her instructions were clear and allowed us to find the place and get inside the cottage quietly, with no disturbance.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cottage is clean, modern and convenient as described. We love the snacks and drinks in the fridge.  Location is great, within walking distance to Ballard or Fremont. Neighborhood is quiet and nice for a quiet stroll.  My husband and I had a wonderful time staying at Melanie and Brian\\'s place.  It was clean, modern, comfortable and pretty much as advertised.  I loved that we could walk both to Ballard and Fremont within about 8-10 minutes.  The neighborhood was quiet and the unit itself was surrounded by trees.  We would gladly stay here again.  We had a fantastic stay at Melanie and Brian\\'s cottage. The communication was very clear, helpful, and welcoming. The number-code lock made it so easy to check in and check out effortlessly. The cottage was adorable, clean, comfortable, and extremely quiet. And the location is excellent for exploring Ballard and Fremont. My friend who lives in Seattle was so impressed when she saw the place that she started looking through the real estate listings to see if she could find something similar in the neighborhood. Thank you Melanie and Brian! We had a great stay here! Cozy and comfy cottage - perfect for our trip to Seattle.  Thanks Melanie and Brian!  We loved the cottage. It was comfortable and very cozy. The neighborhood was very nice and friendly. The location was great with stores and restaurants within walking distance.  Thank you Melanie and Brian for being such great hosts.  We hope to visit Seattle again in the near future. I never met Melanie or Brian during my 5-night stay at the cottage, but I didn\\'t need to -- the check-in instructions i rec\\'d in advance were clear, and the place was ready for me. I love this cottage! Originally I was to be there with another person, and it might have felt a bit tight (where to put the 2nd suitcase?), but I ended up there by myself, and it was perfect for one. I know Seattle well, and I like this neighborhood between Fremont and Ballard -- more restaurants, pubs, and coffeehouses than you can shake a stick at, all within a 15-min or so walk. A huge plus in my book is that this street is very quiet at night. I would definitely stay here again. A really great little place in a great location; awesome stuff within walking distance and a very cute dog we wish we saw more of! The hosts even left beer and candy for us... Recommended.  We had a fantastic trip. We found the cottage to be cozy for two and conveniently located near all of our interests. We can\\'t recommend this listing enough! Melanie and Brian were both super friendly and very accommodating.. And Gravy is the cutest Golden you\\'ll ever meet! We loved this location so much that we\\'re trying to find a place to move nearby. If we\\'re not settled in Seattle by next summer we will definitely be coming back!  Melanie was great at communicating with me about the best places to check out in Seattle and quick to send stay instructions. Everything was super easy to follow and I didn\\'t have to worry about anything. \\r\\nThe cottage had all the basics (fridge, water boiler, bed, restroom, towels, bike if you need it). Melanie also included some tea/coffee and snacks (there was also some energy drinks, water, and beer in the fridge) for our stay so that was pretty awesome! \\r\\nOnly thing that was a bummer was there was no closet or drawer so I had to literally live out of my suitcase. \\r\\nWould definitely recommend and want to stay here again! Melanie was an excellent host. We were updated several days in advance on how to get into the space as well as given specific directions. She gave us great advice on hikes and restaurants to eat at. We would definitely stay here again when we come back to the area.  We didn\\'t have a chance to meet, but did have a wonderful stay. The cottage had everything we needed and the location was terrific. We would definitely recommend to others! The room is a small but cozy cottage in the backyard of the hosts\\' house. While fairly small, it is private, quiet, and comfortable for up to two average size people. The hosts did a good job setting it up in a way that makes it feel cozy and easy to use. I never actually met Melanie or Brian but they were quick to respond and provided all the info I needed to check in and out. Also, I didn\\'t need to contact them because everything was in place, clean, and in working order. They stocked the fridge with some beer and sparkling water, and provided a basket with snacks, as well as a bottle of wine and some instant coffee and tea...there is a small pitcher for heating up water. \\nThere is no kitchen area or microwave, and the fridge is pretty small and doesn\\'t make \"useable\" ice, so plan to dine out or pack a cooler with snacks that don\\'t need to be cooked.\\nThe area has many dining options. There is a great breakfast spot called \"The Dish\" close by, (2 min walk) as well as many other restaurants, bars, and coffee shops in the area within walking distance. \\nParking was a breeze! So many neighborhoods in Seattle are painful to park in but there were at least 5 spots on the street in front of the house at all times. \\nI highly recommend this BnB for ease of use, accessibility, neighborhood, privacy, and comfort. \\nI would not recommend it for large or very tall people, or families with kids.  Had an amazing time in this modern cottage. Loved the neighborhood and the ease of getting around. First time visiting Seattle and I can\\'t wait to come back. So glad I booked with Melanie and Brian over a hotel in the city. Melanie responded to my request to stay there promptly and provided clear directions and instructions for how to access the property.  Even though my arrival was later than expected, she and Brian were most hospitable and helpful.  The cottage was accurately described and shown  online.\\r\\n The place was great and the hosts were extremely welcoming and respectful of our own privacy! The cottage is extremely cozy, and only minutes away from the freeway! The host was even kind enough to lend me a card reader when I had forgotten to bring one. Thank you guys so much!\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvice: Set the heater to 55 degrees and you will have no overheating issues!  Accommodations were clean, quiet and comfortable in a pleasant neighborhood close to public transportation, restaurants and personal shopping needs.\\r\\nHost family was eager to please. Great place and great location. The instructions I received were very clear and they gave me all the info I needed. It was my first experience with airbnb and it definitely did not disappoint! A nice little place. Great for a single but good for two. Tucked away, private and cosy. Great to sleep and wash but listed if you wanted to linger during the day. But why would you do that as Seattle is on the door step. Area is safe and Convient. Saw my hosts at the window and Gravy only barked once. I would stay there again, thanks Melanie and Brian Great little spot! Brian and Melanie provided a perfect guide to using the space and even though the cottage is in the backyard it feels like a private little home. \\r\\n\\r\\n My boyfriend and I had a great experience staying in this cute little space last week. The process from beginning to end was clear, and our hosts—although never having met them—seemed very nice and communicative as needed in getting set up. All the info we needed in order to use the space was outlined very clearly, and there were no surprises as everything was as advertised. Everything was clean and very tidy. The space itself is small, but perfect for two people to refresh and use as a homebase. We were out-and-about the city most of the days, and found a comfortable space waiting for us upon return each evening, in a nice quiet neighborhood. Overall, we couldn\\'t have asked for a better space or hosts while we were in Seattle! This was a great place to stay.  The neighborhood was terrific, just to walk around in, find restaurants and coffee shops, and other sightseeing.  Melanie and Brian provided great recommendations along those lines - definitely check out the \"Guidebook\" (annotated map on the listing).  The space was small but comfy and tidy and I really enjoyed the \"homey\" feel of the space and neighborhood.   Melanie and Brian\\'s cottage is everything promised - fresh, efficient, quiet and private in a very fun and walkable part of Seattle - AND within a 20min drive to every other part of Seattle. They are generous (that stocked fridge?!) and welcoming hosts that are highly respectful of the privacy of their guests. A great go-to for 1-2 people for a long or short visit to Seattle.\\r\\n We stayed at Melanie and Brian\\'s cottage for four nights in mid February. It was a great location, part way between Ballard and Fremont, super easy to physically get into the cottage without having to use a key, and very convenient and quiet. We were able to take advantage of the unusually sunny weather and walk to both Ballard and Fremont to find good food and drinks. The space itself was small, but cozy and a great place to crash each night. We came to Seattle for a concert downtown and the location was an easy 10 minute drive using Highway 99 into the heart of downtown. We never saw our hosts, but we\\'re sure they would have been around if we needed anything.  We loved staying in Melanie and Brian\\'s little cottage! It was perfect for two people. It is extremely small, but is VERY cozy, nice, and clean. We had everything we needed and were comfortable. Melanie and Brian were available if we needed them, but they really just gave us our space and made us feel like we were staying in our own private area. I asked them a couple of questions about the cottage and where to eat while we were there and they responded immediately. Their dog, Gravy, is precious and very friendly. The neighborhood was right in the middle of everything we were wanting to do while in Seattle and felt very safe. Fremont and Ballard are both really fun and this is right in between. Melanie and Brian recommended the Sunday Farmers Market in Ballard which was awesome. Downtown was only about a 10 minute drive. Parking outside of the cottage was always hassle free. Overall, this cottage was quaint, clean, and easy! Check in and check out were a breeze. Thanks, Melanie and Brian! The reservation was canceled 58 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Clean, private, well located. Stayed  here for a week and it was perfect for what I needed. Even had a couple snacks and beers and a bottle of wine to enjoy. Shower was hot and the heater worked well as did the mini fridge. Wifi was top notch, had no problem streaming netflix at night. Don\\'t plan on making any food while staying here but there is an awesome bbq place a block around the corner. 10/10 would stay again After exploring Seattle all day, the cottage was exactly what we needed-a clean, quiet, and cozy place to recap our day and relax.  Restaurants, cafes, and bars are plentiful in the area and are easy to access via walking, buses, Uber, and Car-2-Go.  The cottage had enough amenities to get us by for the five days we were there and the hosts were quick to respond to any inquiries we had.  It was my first trip to Seattle and by day 5 I felt like I lived there. Great experience.  Very nice little private space in a great neighborhood. Everything was as described and ready for our arrival. Melanie was easy to reach with any questions but gave us space. Easy access to busses and to walk to places in Ballard and Fremont.  Melanie and Brian have a gem of a vacation rental:)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was our own private backyard cottage! I loved their style, their little treats left for us and the warm very homey feeling when you come in. Truly our home away from home:) Thank you for sharing your home with us! We will be back!  Melanie & Brian\\'s cottage was simply perfect for my several day stay in Seattle. The description was completely accurate!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location was easy to find and very convenient. Restaurants, grocery stores, public transportation and trails were all within walking distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelanie & Brian thoughtfully stocked a few yummy snacks which was most appreciated after travelling. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bed was super comfortable and I slept really well as it was so quiet. The cottage interior temperature was easy & super fast to heat up/cool down as the weather fluctuated over the long weekend. The shower had great pressure and it was a treat to not have to crouch down to get under the shower head (I\\'m tall).\\r\\n\\r\\nMy stay was relaxed, too short, and I look forward to a repeat stay. Thank you, thank you for making it a great mini-vacation!\\r\\n-Deborah Melanie and Brian\\'s cottage was just what we expected -- a cozy, simple space that served its purpose as a comfortable crash pad while we spent most of our time exploring Seattle. The hosts provided a great amount of detail prior to our arrival, along with recommendations for dining and going out -- which we appreciated, and used. The bed was comfortable, the shower was nice and hot, and the location worked well for us. It\\'s a bit of a walk to either Fremont or Ballard (20 min either way), and we used Car2Go and Uber when we didn\\'t feel like making the treks. All in all, a fine place to stay in Seattle that\\'s close to a lot of great stuff, with considerate hosts who are responsive, friendly, and flexible. We recommend it. Seattle is a wonderful place as is the space of Melanie and Brian. For us it was the perfect spot for our time at the city. The neighborhood is so quiet – we heard chicken in the backyard somewhere. The cottage was as described – easy to find, clean, quiet and cozy and stuffed with a few goodies like tea, coffee and snacks. We found everything what we needed like dining places and grocery stores in the neighborhood and drove around the city by bus which was easy and convenient.  We were thankful for the space Melanie and Brian gave us and would love to come back some day. Thanks so much! Location was great about a mile from both Fremont and Ballard, easy uber distance! Checkin and checkout was a breeze and Melanie and Brian gave great suggestions on where to visit and eat in Seattle. Had a bulb that burned out that was very quickly and promptly replaced! Would recommend for two people, bathroom is small but functional.  Melanie and Brian are great host, lots of recommendations for restaurants and things to do.  Loved their cottage, it has everything you need to make your stay perfect.  Great location, right  in the middle of Ballard/Fremont, easy to walk anywhere from the house.  Would stay there again on our next trip to Seattle, had a great time. The communication from Melanie & Brian ahead of time was fantastic.   Checking-in was a breeze, even though we got in after 10 PM.  The neighborhood is AMAZING.  Both Ballard and Fremont are walkable.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe space is exactly as listed.  Though it\\'s small, we never felt cramped.  If you spend your days in and around Seattle, this is the perfect retreat at the end of the day. We had such a great time staying at Melanie and Brian\\'s cottage! It was incredibly convenient to walk to Fremont and Ballard, and a short drive to anywhere else we wanted to visit.  Their recommendations for restaurants and bars in the area were great as well! We would definitely recommend staying here on your next Seattle trip. Melanie and Brian were incredibly friendly and accomodating! The cottage is absolutely gorgeous, very homey and exceeded our expectations by far. The sunlight in the room was nice to have as well, and on warm nights we were able to open it up and have that cool Seattle breeze flow in. Both hosts were great in sharing their favorite local hotspots, both restaurants and bars that my boyfriend and I absolutely loved! We truly feel like we got the full Seattle experience from the suggestions and accommodation that we were provided with. The neighborhood is nice and quaint and if you\\'re a dog lover like we were, they have an adorable Golden named Gravy that was just as accepting of us. The room also had a bicycle that you could take out in the neighborhood, along with books, magazines, cards, tea, coffee, wine, etc for entertainment. Can\\'t beat the price for the hospitality and housing we were provided with-- highly recommended!  The cottage is in a great location between Fremont & Ballard. The space is perfect for a couple and Melanie/Brian were attentive to our questions. We had a rather hot weekend in Seattle and we appreciated the fans in the cottage. The huge plus is the electronic lock. We had a very late arrival and it was nice not to have to bother our hosts to check-in. All in all, we highly recommend the cottage. I stayed at Melanie and Brian\\'s cottage for 9 nights while transitioning to a new apartment after a move to Seattle. The space was absolutely perfect for my needs: a comfortable bed, a mini fridge, and a fully functional bathroom. It\\'s very minimal, but terrific if you just need a place to call home base. The check-in/out process was very simple with electronic access, and the grounds/neighborhood were great. I can\\'t think of a single thing to criticize.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bicycle that was provided was very useful for checking out the area and riding along the Burke-Gilman trail, and the beers included in the fridge were clutch after some long days apartment hunting. I walked almost everywhere-- trying somewhere new each time-- and there were more bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and grocery stores than I had time for in 9 nights.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelanie and Brian were very accommodating and just extremely friendly and pleasant people overall (even their dog was sweet!).\\r\\n\\r\\nI can\\'t recommend this place enough if you need a space to rest your head in Fremont for 1-2 people.  Love this place. Perfect for one or two people, close to Ballard and lots of nice restaurants and things to do. Melanie and Brian are super hosts -- absolutely recommend to others. We loved our stay here.  The place is in a great location, being able to walk to both fremont and ballard,  and we enjoyed checking out the local bars etc.   Brian and Melainie communications were excellent, checking everything was OK during our stay.  They also provided lots of tips for places to eat / drink before we arrived.  The room itself was great.  If we are ever in the area again we\\'ll be staying here! Neighborhood was very pretty and quiet. Easy to get around. Hosts were very welcoming and had great recommendations. The cottage is quaint and the bed is comfortable.  Het verblijf in de Cottage van Melanie en Brian was geweldig. Het is een moderne, ruime en schone cottage met een eigen entree ernaar toe. Je bent van alle gemakken voorzien. Het heeft een fijne badkamer met een heerlijke douche.\\r\\nIn de koelkast stond een fleswijn klaar en bier en iets lekkers voor bij de koffie of thee.\\r\\nHet was tevens op loopastand van een hele leuke straat, namelijk Fremont str. My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Melanie & Brian\\'s cottage. The neighborhood was quiet, and close enough to the center of Seattle that it wasn\\'t an inconvenience commuting the city via Uber. ($10-$12 to downtown). I didn\\'t have the pleasure of meeting either of our hosts, but they made sure that accessing the property was easy, that the room was clean, and that we had everything we needed. we had a wonderful time in the cottage!  The place cozy and neat, well arranged, with everything we needed.   Excellent accommodations with very friendly hostess/host. Definitely recommend and plan on using again. I couldn\\'t recommend this little cottage enough! It is in a great location between Ballard and Fremont as described. Melanie and Brian were super helpful both in logistics around response times and arrival, but also how to get the most out of the area. I got a week free at CorePower yoga down the road, toured the amazing coffee shops in the area, and ate some amazing food and had great drinks all locally. The cottage is self contained, quiet, and super comfortable/cute. Street parking is readily available and the pad locked door/entrance is really convenient. I felt totally at home, and this is coming from a former Seattleite. Although I only briefly met Melanie (passing through and on the phone so just waving), they were unbelievably helpful and kind. Definitely stay here if you\\'re reading reviews to help make up your mind! Melanie and Brian are the best hosts. They are available if needed but invisible if not needed.\\n\\nThe cottage is super clean, comfortable and convenient to so many things. I love staying with during my trips to Seattle. I didn\\'t have the pleasure of meeting Melanie and Brian, but they made sure I had all the information needed for checking into the cottage and followed up after my arrival. They seem to be super nice folks and provided great information about the area. The location is excellent and the cottage is exactly as the pictures represent. It\\'s clean, cute, quiet and had everything I needed, and the heater kept the room toasty and warm. There\\'s a mini fridge with nice goodies inside. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom, although small, functions well and the shower has good water pressure. There was always street parking available during my visit.\\r\\nMy daughter lives in Seattle so I will be back often, and I will definitely stay in Melanie and Brain\\'s cottage! Great place. Hosts were wonderful. Had everything that we needed. This cottage is amazing! Kelly has everything for a group or even a couple to stay in Ballard.  The cottage is clean and has all the amenities and a Dart Board! Kelly was a great host and kept in touch the whole way and was very accommodating. We would definitely go back next time we head to Seattle! Kelly and Bente were wonderful hosts and their lovely cottage in Ballard was the perfect home-away-from-home for our family. The booking process was smooth. From the warm welcome we received, the special treats for us to enjoy, and a great conversation about local places to check out - it made for a great start to our visit.\\r\\nThe cottage had ample space and all the amenities we needed (and more!) and they even brought out extra toys for our young children to play with. The kitchen and bath are well stocked, the space is light-filled, and the flexibility of the sleeping arrangements was very useful. The neighbourhood is lovely and we enjoyed walking to local amenities.\\r\\nWe hope to stay here again when we next visit Seattle. We loved staying at Kelly\\'s cottage. It was very clean, comfortable and quiet. Would absolutely stay again. Kelly was great and was so helpful with restaurant recommendations.  We had a fantastic 2 week stay here. We are from Seattle and needed a place to stay with our two young kids while we were selling our house. The cottage is in a great neighborhood, in easy walking distance to great restaurants, parks, grocery stores, etc. Moreover, it’s tucked back from the street, so it feels quiet and secluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nKelly was a gracious host and the apartment fully met our needs. It is clean, well-appointed, functional, and has some style. There was even a bottle of wine and some snacks waiting for us on arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’d unequivocally recommend this place to anyone wanting to spend some time in Seattle. Cozy Cottage was the perfect gathering place for our family mini-vacation in Seattle.  Our daughter-in-law and son were visiting from Switzerland and commented that it was by far the best AIRBNB they have utilized.  The cottage had all the amenities we needed and could have stayed long-term and been very comfortable.  The area is quiet and the cottage is clean, neat and well stocked.  We will definitely recommend Cozy Cottage to our friends in North Idaho for their visits to Seattle area.  Thanks for a wonderful time!   The best BNB experience I\\'ve had so far! 3 of us stayed here for 4 nights around my graduation. We were greeted with snacks and beverages on arrival. Hosts were very responsive to our needs. The bathroom was well-stocked with toiletries, and the home entertainment was ample, with Netflix and a supply of DVDs, VHS, and books. Both beds were very comfortable. Generally quiet, but the walls are a bit thin - we heard kids playing outside in the mornings. Off-street parking is nice . Located very close to Goodwill and not too far from a grocery store and bus routes. Would definitely recommend. We so enjoyed our stay with Kelly and his family.  The little cottage is the perfect setting for relaxing; well appointed and beautifully designed.  I make the trip to Seattle often and it is my plan to stay here again when available.  I would think small family or small group of friends, would appreciate it too. These folks know how to make a weary traveler feel welcome. Kelly was a perfect host and the cottage actually exceeded our expectations. My husband, daughter and I were in Seattle for the University of Washington graduation. The space was comfortable and, yes, cozy. This was our first Air B and B experience, so we did not know what to expect. We were met with all the amenities you could imagine such as snacks in the kitchen, shampoo in the bathroom, light cancelling shades great privacy and an outdoor dining area. It was a short drive to campus, bur we became familiar with some of the lovely neighborhoods in the area. The zoo and the Nordic History museum are nearby.\\r\\nwe would surely love to stay there again. Kelly is very welcoming and available as needed. Wifi and off street parking are great extras.  We were so sad to leave the Cozy Cottage; everything about our experience was delightful. The cottage is charming and immaculate and contains everything you will need for your stay. It is located centrally within the Ballard neighborhood, within walking distance of many cafes and restaurants. Kelly and Bente are perfect hosts, knowledgable, helpful and happy to provide suggestions for navigating, dining and enjoying Ballard and Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hope to return soon!\\r\\nEileen & Bob We had a very plaesent stay at the Cozy cottage. There was everything you need and it was clean. Very Nice and helpful host and good beds! The stay in Kelly\\'s cottage was just wonderful and made our memory in Seattle even more unforgettable. --- One of my best experience in airbnb.\\r\\nThe cottage was so perfectly redesigned and you will find yourself very comfortable and relaxed in this warm place. Kelly stocked everything you need in the room and even prepared some welcome snacks (my kids loved that!). \\r\\nThe community is very serene yet still convenient to grab everything you need. \\r\\nI would definitely recommend Kelly\\'s cottage to everyone seeking for an anchor spot to explore Seattle area. I can\\'t say enough about how wonderful my stay was at Kelly and Bente\\'s Cozy Ballard Cottage. A true 10 out of 10 experience! As hosts, Kelly and Bente are super friendly, super accommodating and super helpful. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cottage itself is superb. In terms of size, it fit my parents, my girlfriend and myself really well. Sleeping us four was no problem. And between the living room and the outdoor space, there was more than enough room to relax and just hang out. It was really nice having a full kitchen, really allowing us to not have to eat out for every meal during our 10-day stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, the cottage is super, super clean. \\r\\n*(And for those wondering about the presence of a cat on the premises (though it isn\\'t allowed in the cottage), I am highly allergic to cats and not once during my stay did I sneeze or have any sort of allergic reaction). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood seems really safe. This was actually my second time renting an AirBnB in the Ballard neighborhood (I previously rented a place right down the street). In my experience, the neighborhood is highly walkable and at no time have I felt unsafe. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhich is key because the beauty about staying at the cottage was how walkable (or bikeable...Kelly and Bente have three bicycles for you to use if you want) everything is. There are multiple bus stops nearby, most of them can take you to downtown Seattle or wherever easily. Then there\\'s the downtown Ballard area with all its wonderful shops and restaurants and bars, which are all about a 15 minute walk away. Even though my parents ended up renting a car, you can really get by during your stay at the cottage, whether you\\'re vacationing or in Seattle on business, without renting a car.\\r\\n\\r\\nSafe, clean, accommodating, staying at Kelly and Bente\\'s Cozy Ballard Cottage was a tremendous experience. I\\'d highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lowkey, peaceful place to stay in Seattle while at the same time having convenient access to any and all busier areas in the Seattle area. I would definitely stay here again! The place was clean and fully stocked. The bed was VERY comfy. Location was only 10 min to downtown. They were GREAT hosts and enjoyed their company. Kelly and Bente are gracious hosts.  The rental is tasteful and comfortable in even the minor details.  An earlier guest mentioned that the window curtains did not provide enough privacy.  That definitely has been remedied; the current curtains give complete privacy.  We will return whenever we can.      We had a lovely stay in the Ballard cottage and the gracious hospitality of Kelly and his wife Bente made it all the better. The cottage was exactly as described: cozy, comfortable, peaceful and nicely furnished with a well equipped kitchen.  We will definitely want to stay again the next time we are visiting Ballard and the Seattle area.\\r\\n We had a lovely stay in the Ballard Cottage! Kelly met us when we arrived and made sure that we had everything we needed for our two night stay. Kelly and his wife really went above and beyond to make us feel at home: they even left local chocolates, cookies, and other little treats waiting for us in the kitchen! Additionally, they both recommended great places for us to eat and hang out in the area. We couldn\\'t have found a more perfect place to call home as we explored Seattle. It was the highlight of our trip and I hope that we have a chance to visit again soon! Kelly and family were very gracious. We were given a tour of the cottage amenities and equipment upon arrival. It was a very efficient, orderly and lovely space. The beautiful outside picnic area and gardens were an extra treat. The neighborhood was pleasant and close to Ballard\\'s downtown retail and restaurants. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely choose this cottage again .  Thank you Fernandis! My wife and two children stayed at this great space for 3 nights. Kelly and Bente were perfect hosts. They gave us all the privacy we needed but were always there if we needed something. The cottage itself was perfect for us. The smaller bedroom was very comfortable for my children and the main bed was very comfortable. The entire space is very well laid out and thoughtfully outfitted. We appreciated that the space was spotlessly clean as well. We wanted for nothing. The area is extremely quiet too. We all slept solidly throughout the nights. Highly recommended!  Our stay with Kelly was fantastic!  It was a very clean and gorgeous cottage!  Kelly was very friendly and answered all questions we had about the city.  He even brought us local chocolate and plums from their tree.  We recommend starting there 100%! The description was understated as to how completely comfortable and welcoming this adorable cozy cottage experience actually was. Kelly and Bente were great hosts, and the cozy cottage was just perfect.  They\\'ve done a fantastic job with the space!  There are tons a great restaurants and spots nearby (10-15 min walking through the peaceful neighborhood).  If you are up for it, we highly recommend walking to Portage Bay Cafe for breakfast (30 min away), then over the Ballard Locks to reach Discovery Park (another 30 min).  Pack a picnic, and take the North Beach trail to the lighthouse for lunch on the beach.  Beautiful.  You can either walk back, or Uber/Lyft/Flywheel onward from there.  What a great city, and Kelly and Bente\\'s cottage is a perfect home base to enjoy it from.  Thanks so much for everything! We\\'d recommend to anyone.  - The Closes Fabulous! Staying for two nights in the yellow cottage was the perfect start to our cross country trip.  It was clean & cozy, with comfortable beds, good pillows and nice amenities.  \\r\\nBente & Kelly went above and beyond, bringing us milk, jam, cheese and European style bread (which my German mother & friend said was delicious), and walking with us to a restaurant to make sure we found it. \\r\\nIf I ever have a chance to return to Seattle, (which I hope I do, it\\'s a great city) the cute yellow cottage is where I will stay!  Staying at the cottage made our week so much more comfortable than it would have been in a hotel. The cottage was beautifully decorated and thoughtfully designed. We were welcomed by Kelly and Bente as if we were family!!!  We will be staying there every time we visit in  the future!!!! Kelly was a great host! He was very thorough on all the cottage was appointed with and was available if anything was needed. It was perfect for our girls\\' weekend. I was in Seattle for work, and the cottage was perfect. Clean, comfy and had all the kitchen supplies I needed, and then some. Kelly was a very accommodating host. The fireplace and bed are the highlights. The fire made the cottage so cozy.  Just arrived home, and although it\\'s always great to return from the road, we both agreed, \"this doesn\\'t feel any different than the cottage\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s how great the cottage and our hosts were. As we rediscovered Seattle, we would elect to \"go home\" for lunch or just \"hang out\". I can\\'t imagine NOT staying here as long as the Fernandi\\'s will have us! It was perfect! Thank you! A very quaint little cottage in a beautiful neighborhood. Kelly and Bente were fabulous hosts. They made us feel so welcome with a flexible check-in and check-out and a delicious bottle of red wine. Loved the cottage so much with all the decor and fire place. Very well designed....they thought of everything! I will most definitely look to stay here again in the future. I had such a wonderful stay here and I would recommend it to anyone over a hotel. Such a positive energy flows through this cozy little yellow love cottage. Great experience that I will hold close for years to come.  Place was beautiful, comfortable, perfect for our weekend getaway in Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nKelly was a great host. The cottage was in immaculate shape, definitely recommend for anyone traveling to Seattle! Very comfortable well equipped cottage with friendly and thoughtful hosts. The cottage is conveniently located and was just right in terms of size for the two of us. We had a very nice time at this Ballard Cottage.  Way better and much more personal than a regular hotel.  The room was clean, comfortable and had everything you need for a nice weekend.  Even worked really well with a small baby.  The Cottage is in a nice quite neighborhood and had off street parking which is really nice since street parking in Ballard is hard to come by.  Finally the host family was kind, available, and flexible.  Overall a wonderful experience. Kelly and Bente (sp?) made us feel very welcome.  We were given a thorough tour and offered the use of their driveway, which is nice in Seattle.  They have the house well-stocked with coffee and have good appliances (coffee maker!).  The bathroom is clean and the linens are nice and fluffy.   The little guest house is perfect, with all the touches that make it special.  it has a small kitchen, washer & dryer, wifi, a fireplace, a comfortable bed.  it is ideal for 2-3 people.  The host (Kelly) even brought us soy creamer and half&half for our coffee.  absolutely recommend. Well appointed, comfy and private, this little oasis in Ballard has provided a home away from home for my son and me for the second time and I\\'m sure will again.   We loved this spot in Ballard. Kelly & his wife have really thought of every detail. We stayed with our two year old and the sleeping arrangements were perfect. We would highly recommend this place.  Kelly was there to meet us upon arrival to show us around and make sure we had everything we needed.  As coffee drinkers, we were pleased to have provided coffee and Kelly made sure we had dairy and non dairy options to add.  Kelly and his wife had great recommendations for restaurants in the neighborhood, most of which we tried and loved.  The space was clean, very cozy, especially with the gas fireplace, and the bed was extremely comfortable! I also thought it was very nice that we got use the driveway.  We loved staying in Ballard and meeting Kelly and his family.  We felt right at home, and hope to make it back! This is a very cute and clean cottage. Kelly was a great host and thought of the little details to make us feel welcome and comfortable. The cottage was about a 15 minute walk to downtown Ballard which was great! Highly recommend for someone who wants to stay in a private and quiet area.  Kelly was an amazing host!  He was walking out the door to greet us as soon as we pulled up.  The cottage was quaint and comfortable, miles better than a hotel room.  It had been well stocked with food items, GREAT coffee, toiletries, ect.  Kelly was always available if we had a question, and recommended some amazing restaurants in the area.  The neighborhood was beautiful, and the cottage was only three blocks from the friend I was visiting.  We only met his wife once, briefly, but she was very nice.  I would absolutely stay again! The cottage was a wonderful place to stay.  More than that, Kelly was a wonderful host.  He was very accommodating to our last-minute travel changes and even refunded us for the night we were unable to make it to the cottage.  Such a gracious host!  I wish I could give him and the cottage extra stars.\\r\\n\\r\\n Kelly was great! House was clean and he offered us great directions and recommendations on getting around the city. House is close to several bus lines leading directly into downtown Seattle and downtown Ballard.  Thank you Kelly! \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a wonderful cottage and was very warm despite the cold of a Seattle winter. Lots of room for a small group, great amenities, and wonderful hosts! I will definitely stay here again in future visits to the Seattle area. We made a last minute reservation and were warmly greeted and welcomed, despite the fact that another guest left that morning. The  cottage was so perfectly laid out and my family of 4 (two teens with mom and dad) marveled continuously of how comfortable and perfect it all was. The kitchen was stocked with every utensil we needed to cook our meals, there were movies and books to fit all our interests, a quaint safe neighborhood and Kelly and Benta gave us the feeling we could ask for whatever help we needed. We could not have been happier. Also, great things nearby - a fabulous Indian restaurant in town, a climbing gym for the children, bike trails, parks and a fabulous fish ladder and locks  and much more.  Cozy Ballard Cottage is super sweet and both Kelly and Bente are awesome folks. I will surely rent this place again and highly recommend it! The dart board and family friendly movie selection in the smaller room made my 10 year old very happy as well.  Kelly and Bente were wonderful hosts! My friend and I are third year physical therapy students, and we stayed in the cottage for a four month time period during our final clinical rotations. The place was in a great location to the market, downtown Ballard, and a short jog to Green Lake! Bente and Kelly were extremely generous with suggestions and offering amenities for the cottage. They were great people to get to know, and the cottage had everything we needed for spending four months in Seattle! We loved our time here! This is my second time staying at the Cozy Ballard Cottage, and it was just as wonderful as the first.  Kelly and family are wonderful hosts.  The location is excellent and the cottage was clean, comfy and had everything I needed.   Kelly and Bente were very friendly and welcoming hosts! We stayed for 10 nights and it was an excellent experience. The location is wonderful with many great restaurants nearby and things to do. The cottage has everything you could possibly need and it is an extremely well thought out space. The beds were very comfortable; it is just a cozy little place to call home while on vacation. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely return!  This was our first time to book through Airbnb, the Fernandi family and their cottage exceeded all our expectations.  They could not have been better host.  They greeted us when we arrived, suggested a fabulous restaurant for our first dinner in Seattle and provided directions to a great local market.   Best of all they graciously gave-up their driveway for us...if you\\'ve ever been to Seattle you know what a luxury a driveway is.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cottage was bigger than we thought, it was adorable, had super comfortable beds and linens and was spotlessly clean!  We were so glad we choose the Ballard neighborhood as it was easy to get around and close to everything we wanted to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe highly recommend the Cozy Ballard Cottage!  Thank you Fernandi family for your hospitality.   I felt very welcome and Kelly met me with a smile and welcome.\\r\\nHe walked me though and explained where things were.\\r\\nIf I had any questions just call,text or knock on the door.\\r\\nI felt very safe and secure as I was alone. The neighborhood was quiet and friendly.\\r\\nThere kitchen was well stocked and very clean. The entire place was super clean and fresh. The Ballard cottage was perfect. Kelly and Bente were the sweetest, most welcoming hosts. There were four of us and we all had a bed and space to move around. The love that was poured into creating this bnb was completely apparent. Overall, this was an amazing experience. We fell in love with Seattle and will be back for more.  We loved the house as well as our hosts!  We were worried because we had never used AirB&B before. It was a great experience. If we go back to the area, we will def stay here again.  Kelly and Bente are experienced and wonderful hosts...We were at the cottage for a week...(single grandmother with two teenage boys) and it was the perfect space and location.  The cottage was as described and pictured...lovely garden setting in residential neighborhood yet close to public transportation as we did not rent a car. We were able to enjoy privacy in the cottage and sleeping arrangements were private for the three of us.  Every detail was well thought through or the cottage and was very clean, attractive, and comfortable.  We even had help with finding a skateboard shop, tourist suggestions, etc.  We are most appreciative and would love to come back another time. The Cozy Ballard Cottage was awesome and perfect for my family of four.  Even though the host was away during our stay, his hospitality and resourcefulness was most evident, both in the binder for the cottage and in our correspondence.  The listing provided was accurate.  As a neighborhood, Ballard was just as welcoming as our host.  We can certainly understand how our hosts call Ballard home.  We liked Kellys place very much. Quiet, very clean and cosy. Kelly was very helpful with everything. Thanks a lot, Kelly.  Kelly\\'s cottage is adorable and an incredibly efficient use of space.  It is just as described, and our family of 4 was very happy there.  The kids loved the dart board.  We happened to be staying in the cottage during a heat wave, and the many windows made it easy to stay cool.  We appreciated and used the rotating fan.\\r\\n\\r\\nKelly left some yummy snacks for us and a binder full of information.  Our son read through it and saw a chocolate factory near by.  We went on a fascinating tour and ate some delicious chocolate.  :)  Thank you of the idea, Kelly, and thank you for letting us stay in your cottage! Great Seattle vacation in excellent accommodation! Really appreciated Kelly\\'s prompt, friendly & helpful communication. The cottage was immaculately clean, is tastefully decorated, and was equipped with everything you require (and more!) The location was great and we had fun exploring the local attractions by foot and by bike. Getting a bus nearby was also no problem. Thank you! The cottage was exactly what we were looking for. It was clean, cozy, and perfectly located. I cannot imagine staying anywhere else if we are ever in Seattle again. Wonderful little house for our family\\'s two night stay in Seattle.  They have thought of everything!  Our family of five (kids age 20, 16 and 12) were comfortable in the cozy cottage - beds were great, well stocked kitchen and super efficient use of space.  We arrived a little early (oops)  but Kelly was quick to assure us it was fine and we headed out to explore Seattle while housekeeping was done.  The guest manual was very helpful and we truly enjoyed our stay.  Make sure you hit The Skillet Diner when you\\'re in Ballard - one of the best breakfasts we\\'ve ever had.   Lovely little cottage with everything you need. Clean and very comfortable queen size bed.  We had 3 kids with us, and while it was small for 5 it worked.  The neighborhood is really nice.  Very quiet.  Walking distance to restaurants, grocery store and 20 minutes from downtown.  I would recommend this to everyone! Just returned from a wonderful trip to Seattle\\'s delightful Ballard neighborhood. We chose Kelly & Bente\\'s cozy & comfortable cottage as it is a fully detached unit less than two blocks from our son & daughter-in-law\\'s home. What a jewel! It was a perfect retreat. Quiet, well maintained, and containing all the amenities of home. We were originally concerned about the lack of air conditioning but even with daytime highs in the 80s, we were cool & comfortable at night. The cottage is within easy walking distance to pubs, restaurants, delis, parks, etc.  &  close to the eclectic historic downtown Ballard retail district. Downtown Seattle is an easy & inexpensive Uber ride away.  Kelly & Bente are great hosts who succeed in making their guests feel appreciated and truly welcome in their home. We look forward to returning to their cottage next spring.  Very welcoming host! Kelly and Bente were such gracious, fun loving hosts.  The cozy cottage they built fit our needs perfectly.  The cottage\\'s close proximity to the Ballard Locks, Discovery Park, and our wedding party\\'s home and venues made our trip that much more convenient and special.\\r\\n\\r\\nKelly and Bente it was a pleasure to meet you.  Thank you so much.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrent and Stacy Kelly and his family were so friendly and helpful.  We felt welcome and thoroughly enjoyed the peacefulness of our stay. The cottage was as described. The first morning we were there Bente brought us a bowl of fresh plums from their tree! Delicious!!\\r\\n\\r\\nNeighborhood was fine. Nice quiet nights....weren\\'t there much during the day! This stay exceeded our expectations. We arrived late on a Thursday night (12:30), and Kelly met us at the door to the cottage to show us around, which wasn\\'t necessary but very much appreciated. The cottage is located in an area with which my family is very familiar so we were close to friends and family, a plethora of restaurants and activities and much more. It was mostly cold and wet during our trip, but that made the cottage even more cozy with its working gas fireplace, super comfortable mattresses and bedding, and well-stocked kitchen area. We actually looked forward to returning to \"home\" every day and found it to be incredibly relaxing, especially in light of the less-than-stellar weather. My family of four had plenty of room, and there was enough storage for us to actually put our things away and to feel like we were home. I highly recommend this cottage! Great space and exactly as described!  This was the last stop on our trip to Seattle/Vancouver and was a wonderful place to stay.  Everything looks well maintained and good quality (which has not always been the case for many of the places I\\'ve stayed). Kelly and her husband made the whole process very easy and checked in on us a few times to make sure we were comfortable.  Highly recommended!  \\r\\nOne thing to note, it would be best for people to have a car if you stay here..though theoretically things are in walking distance, a car will make it a lot easier to get to some of the fun places in Ballard.   The cottage was such a warm welcoming place, and Kelley and his family made us feel so welcomed.  Perfect for our family of 4. We didn\\'t get too much time to enjoy the cottage, but sleeping there was very comfortable for us and two school aged kids. We did find we were in easy driving distance for a Sunday morning run around Green Lake and also very close to the great restaurants, shopping and farmers\\' market in Ballard. House was very clean and had everything we needed. Kids loved that there were house slippers like we have at home and a little welcome basket of snacks and drinks. Husband liked the fireplace : ). Thank you for a wonderful stay! The Cozy Ballard Cottage exceeded my expectations.  Check in was very easy, the place was so inviting and welcoming.  Kelly and Bente have done a great job at making it a private, welcoming, and cozy cottage - even leaving some welcome snacks!  Such a nice touch!  Bente was so welcoming and they offer great resources in person and in the cottage to help navigate Ballard and Seattle!  Ballard is amazing!  Such a great neighborhood with so many amazing place to explore around every corner.  We didn\\'t want to leave!  I wish we had more time to spend with Bente (Kelly was out of town unfortunately).  I hope to come out and visit again and will definitely stay here if available!  A plus - the bed was probably the most comfortable I have ever slept on!   My wife and I loved the Cozy Ballard Cottage. A great weekend retreat in a very quiet neighborhood that\\'s within easy walking distance to a wide diversity of eating and drinking establishments. Kelly was very welcoming and the accommodations were exactly as advertised. All the comforts of home in a very compact and private setting. We\\'ll be back! The cottage was just perfect for my trip to visit my brother and new nephew in Ballard. Everything was well-appointed and *very* comfortable, and just as lovely as the photos show. If you have any free time at the cottage, there was a nice little selection of movies to watch, as well as games for adults and kiddos. It was nice to curl up in front of the fireplace at night and take in a little movie time!\\r\\n\\r\\nKelly and his wife were both extremely friendly and welcoming. Kelly showed me around the cottage when I first arrived, which was very helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nBallard itself was an amazing neighborhood. My family and I walked to beautiful Sunset Hill park, as well as the Ballard Farmers Market. I loved what a vibrant, eclectic and cool neighborhood this was! We couldn\\'t have asked for better!  This was the perfect place for our family.  It has everything a person could want or need, plus some.  It was super clean and comfortable.  My granddaughter loved the cat that greeted us when we would arrive home.  Kelly and Bente were warm and approachable.  We loved everything about our stay!  Thanks Kelly, Bente & Echo for your hospitality! We had a great stay. Kelly was very friendly and welcoming and available, and the cottage was exactly as described -- cared for and clean. What else can be said .. all the recent reviews for Kelly, Bente and their Cozy cottage are accurate ... \"Ditto\" ... wonderful experience and I hope its available when I return to see my grandson again ... soon.    Kelly was prompt in responding before our arrival, and greeted us warmly when we got there. The cottage is just as described, well furnished and stocked with all the kitchen essentials you\\'d expect, plus many extras. Bente and Kelly were great hosts, easily accessible for questions or help.  You will love staying here! Crow\\'s Nest Cottage is full of light (high ceiling, lots of great windows) yet very private. It\\'s tucked in the back yard of a private home, but none of the windows face any other buildings. It delivers on all three: lots of light, close access to bus line, restaurants, and shopping, and yet total privacy. It is a sturdy, beautifully designed building (I\\'d describe as rustic modern) with thick walls that contain sound well: blast music or shout out your creed and not be heard by neighbors. Top of the line appliances, kitchen, and bath fixtures. Lots of natural wood (butcher block kitchen counters and thick, exposed wood for loft floor which is also the kitchen ceiling). Giant ceiling fan, tank-less-on-demand-hot-water heater, skylight with a remote shade for sleeping in, and excellent light fixtures throughout. My father is an architect and I can\\'t wait to put him up here. This place delivers a lot of simple luxuries for a very good price. The hosts, Amy and Matt have the right demeanor for Airbnb: they have a kind and easy going nature, are clear communicators, responsive to emails, calls, and texts, and are thoughtful about the details (nice towels, cutlery, kitchen ware, etc.). With kindness and good humor they set me up with everything I needed, left me alone, but were readily available when I wanted or needed to engage. You can walk down 6th Ave to Veraci Pizza or Slate Coffee shop. Walk, ride, or drive for 4 minutes over to Ballard Market to stock up the cool LG bottom-freezer fridge. I wish I could live there permanently. I will definitely be back.      Blair was very easy to communicate with and checked in a few times leading up to the stay and during. The house is in a great location just 10-15 minutes drive from downtown without traffic. Downtown Ballard and Fremont are very close. We had a rental car and everything was convenient. Parking was very simple\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house looked like it had just been renovated and everything was pristine and clean. There were a few things that would have really helped to have such as cooking oil, a wine bottle opener (to open the bottle of seattle wine from the host!), and some cooking spices to complement the great new kitchen. Towels, linens, and toiletries were supplied and very nice. \\r\\n\\r\\nSlate coffee house was just down the road 2 blocks and easy to walk to. We did some morning runs to Green Lake park, rigorous hills but very convenient. All in all our group of 6 very much enjoyed the stay and would definitely recommend the place! Communication between Blair and us was prompt and friendly. This helps ease tensions when traveling to an unknown land filled with strangers and unfamiliar traffic patterns. We’re from the country, so streets jam-packed with automobiles can be tricky to maneuver for us. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe spacious home is nestled in a quiet neighborhood with ample parking. We enjoyed sitting under the crabapple tree in the evenings on the back porch, listening to the rustling leaves and the occasional jogger huffing by (usually with dog in tow). Our two youngest children enjoyed quietly looking for bugs underneath rocks and plants located behind the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nA big bonus for us – this house was outfitted with a lot of pillow choices for each bed. Some rentals skimp when it comes to comfy; were relieved to see this one didn\\'t cut any corners when it came to cozy bedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would recommend this tidy and spacious place to anyone traveling to Seattle. \\r\\n This house is in a nice safe neighborhood that is close to Ballard, Fremont, and Phinney Ridge. \\r\\n\\r\\nCheck in was very quick and easy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is nicely finished and had all the little things you need to make a nice stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe beds were very comfortable and we all slept well.\\r\\n\\r\\nNice washer/dryer. Neighborhood was quiet and pleasant, the house more than met all our expectations and accommodated comfortably. Blair was very helpful and prompt to reply to our questions, would definitely stay here again. 8 of us were visiting Seattle as a reunion trip and Blair\\'s house in Ballard was just perfect for us! It was clean, comfy, and really adorably finished.\\r\\nThe location of the house is also just so convenient. Thank you for a wonderful stay in Seattle! We had a great stay at Blair\\'s home. We had 7 in our group, and we all slept comfortably. The house was very close to our office in Fremont so we could all walk back and forth. The house was great overall. However when we arrived there was stale coffee in the coffee maker that the cleaner had neglected which smelled bad and we had to clean. Since the check-in is so late - 3pm - I was surprised at such an obvious oversight. Aside from this one blip the place was great. We were there during the hottest days of summer so having more fans in the house - at least one for each bedroom is a must - Blair was very responsive in getting us a second fan when we requested one Blair\\'s 3-bedroom place in Seattle worked very, very well for our family.  Everything was clean and set-up when we arrived and the accommodations were excellent.  The bed that my wife slept on was very comfortable.  We were hosting other out-of-town friends and family for a memorial program and the living room space was our home away from home.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBlair provided us with instructions and directions (although we know Seattle very well in any event) and he was prompt and engaging when responding to questions. \\r\\n\\r\\nBrimmer & Heeltaps, just a couple of blocks down the street, was ideal for dinner once we finished driving and checked in one late, hot afternoon.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe unit (part of a side by side duplex) is not the prettiest little home you will see in Seattle from the outside, but it is new, handsome and well appointed inside.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBecause we were gathered for a memorial, and had lots and lots of visiting to do, we had to be a little careful to remind ourselves of the \"quiet curfew\" outdoors.  Seattle is a densely packed residential city and the neighbors are never far away.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf we needed a larger space in Seattle again, we would not hesitate to come back to this spot.  The house was in great condition, all was as expected. We were really happy with the location as well, near Fremont and Ballard with great eating options really close by! I booked Blair\\'s place for my family who visited Seattle. My family said his place was clean and spacious. They enjoyed their stay a lot. Blair was very prompt and is a good host.  A great, clean home right in the area we wanted to be in.  Easy access to downtown and even easier access to some really cool and interesting restaurants and bars in the Ballard neighborhood.  Our host provided everything we needed to make our stay great! We had a wonderful time in Seattle. The house was spacious enough for 6 of us and everything was nicely updated. Blair was super friendly and prompt with all emails and requests. We had trouble with the coffee maker and when we called he immediately delivered a new one. The kitchen was well stocked and plenty of linens and towels where available. We appreciated being able to wash our clothes after our long hikes and sleeping in the comfortable beds. The only thing that didn\\'t work well was the downstairs TV. It wasn\\'t hooked up to any cable or dish but there were enough DVDs to keep us occupied. (Remotes didn\\'t work either)   Overall I loved the neighborhood and the house and would love to come back to stay again. Thank you Blair for answering all my questions and being so accommodating. Sibylle & Trevor, Austin Tx This place was absolutely perfect for our needs. We stayed here comfortably and we loved it. The place is beautiful, new, clean and convenient to everything. Communication with Blair was easy. Booking was easy.  Amazing home! This will now be our \"go-to\" place in Seattle. Host was amazing, house was perfect!  Great place and quiet location. Loved the bed, very comfy, Blair uses high quality cotton sheets, made for a great nights sleep. Only a 10 to 15 minute walk to local restaurants, shops, etc. I would definitely stay there again.  This was my first experience with airbnb and it will not be my last.  We were in Seattle for our nephews wedding and we decided to make a long weekend of it.  The house was perfect!  I wouldn\\'t have changed a thing.  Everything was so clean and the host had thought of everything.  The pillows and beds were comfy and warm.  We will be heading back to Seattle to spend a week in the future and this home will be our first pick!  For this family Hotels are a thing of the past.  We\\'re sold on airbnb!!! Beautiful home!!! Everything is so clean and neat. Blair is so quick and efficient in responding to us. Thank u again!!! The house was great. We were all pleasantly surprised at how nice the house was for such a reasonable price. I would recommend this home to anyone. The host made us welcome and even accommodated our early arrival when we were in a huge time crunch.  The house is very comfortable for a family. It was clean and Blair is a very helpful host who responded to me immediately. The kitchen was well supplied and easy to work in. We also appreciated that the location was so close to all the sites within Seattle. Also, easy street parking is  a real plus in established Seattle neighborhoods.  The place was really nice, updated kitchen and baths. Very comfortable beds and linens. Perfect location for our visit.  Allowed us to have more space and was much better than staying in a hotel.  Easy to locate.  We were given complete, detailed instructions.  Very accommodating.\\r\\n This home was just what we needed as family came from out of town for my daughter\\'s wedding in Ballard.  It was close to \"the action\"  and very comfortable.  It provided the opportunity to sit down together over home cooked spagetti.  Very nice. Perfect!! The location was great, the place was amazing- spacious and clean. Would definitely recommend to everyone and would stay again. So homey and comfortable.  Wonderful and spacious home in a very convenient location in the Ballard area. Blair was very accommodating to our needs and helped us out when we needed it.  I visited Seattle for work with a few colleagues and our stay at Blair\\'s house was nothing less than awesome. The house is extremely clean, warm and welcoming. Sitting around the fireplace after a long day of work was exactly what we needed and the beds were hands down the best part of the house. SO comfortable! Seattle coffee in the fridge for our early mornings was also a huge plus. I would definitely recommend staying at Blair\\'s place - I know we\\'ll be back soon! This Seattle home, which is actually half of a duplex, is in a great location of Seattle. It was especially convenient for our quick, multi-generational family gathering for my sisters wedding downtown.the photos show the house accurately and there was plenty of off street parking. Blair was responsive and helpful. Only negative was the extremely loud party of guests on the other side of the duplex, who started partying after midnight, and kept it up till I called the police at 2:30. Don\\'t know why guests on airbnb could ignore the stated house rules and just basic courtesy, but it ruined our last night there. Blair was very helpful from the get go. His place is in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of street parking. Location is amazing with only 15min to DT Seattle and Trader Joes is only a 5min drive. The place is homey with comfortable beds for all 8 of us! Wish there were lids to pots and more kitchen utensils but overall a great weekend stay for a big group :) This home was perfect for us. We had 4 adults and 2 toddlers. The neighborhood is quiet. It\\'s easy to get to Ballard and anywhere else in the city. There is a nice coffee shop within walking distance. This house was perfect for our needs.  Very comfortable in quiet safe neighborhood.  We would definitely stay here again. Good. Courteous and hospitable host. Always available to answer questions. This is a beautiful home with all the amenities and a great location on a quiet street. You know how you see pictures of a place and wonder if it will be as nice as it appears? Blair\\'s home lives up to the promise.  There are two private bedrooms upstairs and downstairs makes a great family suite, if you have kids, with a double bed and comfy futon. Highly recommended. We enjoyed Blair\\'s house very much. My wife, 3 year old and myself shared the house with both our parents, and the setup was good. The finished basement with a futon was perfect for a toddler, as was the lack of breakable items. Everything worked perfectly, and the house, which is part of a duplex in a nice, walkable neighborhood, was ideally located, near grocery stores, and a short jaunt (via the 15th street bridge) to the Seattle Center. We cooked most of our meals at home, and we would have preferred that the kitchen had been a bit better equipped (There were not potholders, for example and only one spatula, and some of the knives were broken),  but generally we had a very nice time.    This is a beautiful home with lots of nice touches. I wish we could have stayed longer so I could try out that beautiful kitchen. Tons of room, super comfy beds, cozy living room with fireplace, nice views, and safe storage for our equipment. We loved it and would definitely stay again! We would return to this home in a heartbeat.   The location is so close to the fun of the Ballard area and easy to access other city locations, but on a very quiet street with easy parking.   The caretaker got back to us immediately with a question we had.  Thanks for a great stay.  I like your house so much. Thank you. It is a good place to live in. We also like environment around your home. Thank you again.   This house was clean, stylish and fun for our Seattle getaway! 7 of us slept quite comfortably with room to spare. Blair was helpful in answering any questions leading up to the event. It was a pleasant stay at Blair\\'s property. Blair was really nice and patient. He helped me find the door key and his house was really good and clean.   highly recommended  Our stay was great. The listing description was very accurate, and everything went off without a hitch. Great place in a quiet neighborhood with all Ballard sites within walking distance. Host made getting in and out easy. We came out to Seattle for a friend\\'s wedding and stayed at Blair\\'s after to explore the city more.  Blair\\'s house was great!  It had everything we needed and enough space for all of us.  The house was at a great location.  There are grocery stores and restaurants within walking distance.  It\\'s a bit farther away from downtown but we saw plenty of buses that could get you there.  We used Uber to get around so the split fares between us all were pretty good.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBlair was really great about responding and very accommodating.  We had a rental car we needed to return and Blair let us stop by to drop off luggage before our official check in time.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely recommend staying here! The house was very nice and matched the description of the listing well. The kitchen was sleek and modern, we liked that there were plenty of cooking pans, plates, and silverware since our group made meals at home multiple times. The bathrooms were very clean and even had toiletries like shampoo in case you forgot some of your own. There\\'s free wifi and the living room even had a Chromecast set-up on the TV so you can stream netflix or hulu from your mobile devices. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a Safeway, Whole Foods, and several other grocery stores within a 5 minute drive. Also many restaurants and coffee shops. \\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone said the beds were extremely comfortable, better than even what we have to sleep on at home. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed like a very quiet neighborhood, plenty of parking on the street. Overall very pleased with our stay! Blair\\'s house is exactly as described, clean and comfortable in great location. There are three bedrooms. Two bedrooms share one bathroom on the 2nd floor and a big one with bathroom at downstair. They provide BBQ place and tools too, although we didn\\'t use I can tell that you and your friends would enjoy your time. Blair was a wonderful host!  We had great communication before we arrived. The apartment was clean and looked just like the  photos had indicated.  The location was perfect for my needs for the week!  I bussed and walked all over the city, as this place is so convenient. I definitely recommend staying here! The house was clean and very nice on the inside. The description was accurate. My friend who lives in the area was jealous she didn\\'t live here! Blair was fantastic. She was very accommodating with our schedule for checking in (as we were there for a wedding and had conflicting schedules with the check in time). The house was exactly as pictured and more than enough room for 6 people.  The neighborhood was adorable And quiet. We had an awesome time in Seattle and would definitely return back to Blaire\\'s house! We had a lovely stay at Blair\\'s place.  The beds were super-comfortable, and the sheets were very soft.  The neighborhood was great, with a great brewery down the road, and a park at the end of the street for the kids.  The area was also very quiet, and was located at the perfect distance from the crazy Seattle traffic.  Some minor hiccups with the amount of soap/laundry detergent/toilet paper left for 6 people, but Blair took care of it once it was brought to his attention.  Everything was exactly as described in the write-up, and we would definitely stay here again. Blair\\'s house was fantastic! There\\'s plenty of room for an entire family and lots of beds and room for people to hang out in. The kitchen and appliances are also fantastic if you\\'re in to that sort of thing. Great location, as well – halfway between Fremont and Ballard (Freelard), walking distance to Hale\\'s Brewery (try the Cream Ale\\xa0– amazing), and a quick cab or drive to either downtown Fremont or Ballard.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould absolutely stay again. 안녕하세요. 저는 한국에서 이 숙소에 8일간 머물렀던 (website hidden) 분들께도 도움되시라고 한글로 남겨요. 이 집은 주방, 욕실, 세탁실, 침구 모든 것이 정말 완벽하리만큼 좋은 곳이에요. 위치 또한 조용하고 유덥이나 다운타운과 모두 가깝답니다. 또한 침대가 너무 편안해서 여행 내내 잠을 정말 잘 (website hidden) 분들 머물 일 있다면 저는 강추에요~^^ Blair was attentive through the booking process and helpful answering questions leading up to the rental date.   We had an excellent stay at this house!!! All appliances were updated and beautiful!  Neighborhood was great and had a playground near that we took our toddler to!\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse was super clean and the beds were sooo comfortable!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nBlair was very fast with replies! Blair was super responsive, the house was extremely clean and organized, and the location was great. We had such a great trip! The house was great, clean and an awesome stay! We had an excellent experience with all of our expectations met.  Blair has paid attention to all the details so we had no trouble getting the key and found the house was clean and bedding, towels, dishes, cutlery etc were all in order.   We liked the neighborhood and on street parking was no problem.  We would definitely stay here again. Blair\\'s place is clean and organized just almost like the photo that she shows. The neighborhood is quiet as well.  Very clean, and in a nice part of town. I would definitely stay there again! Check-in and out was super easy with the lockbox system. Place was clean and spacious enough for us (group of 8). Would definitely stay here again! Absolutely perfect. I stayed here with a couple colleagues while on a work trip in Ballard. The house is large, well stocked, and clean. One of the hesitations with scheduling an AirBnb for work trips is that it can really feel odd to stay on someone\\'s house. Sleeping in someone\\'s paisley sheets, pictures of their kids on the wall, personal affects everywhere, etc. While I don\\'t mind it, I know it can bother other people. I was SO glad to find this listing because it is definitely a full-time rental. The beds are super comfy with simple white sheets and towels. The upstairs bathroom is very large. The kitchen is clean and the styling is spacious and elegant. Getting access to the home and hopping on the wifi was straightforward. Blair communicated well and responded fast to the initial booking. Thanks for the great stay! Blair made us feel welcome and provided great, detailed instructions for us to follow. The house was a perfect set up for us, rooms well appointed, very comfortable, and location of the house was close in proximity to meet all our needs. The house was not ready by check-in time, but I contacted Blair and he made sure this was addressed as soon as possible. As a result, we ended up meeting \"D\", his cleaning person, who was very apologetic, personable, and did a great job of getting the place ready for us. We will definitely keep this house information handy for our next trip!   Blair\\'s home was clean, spacious and in a great location. We (5 adults) all slept comfortably and would definitely reserve the home again. The best part is the location! The neighborhood is charming and it doesn\\'t hurt to be able to walk to 10 different microbreweries! Blair touched base with us before we checked in, which we appreciated. The description on the site was accurate, and the house was clean. It was perfect for our group--spacious and walking distance to many local attractions.  It was really clean, new and absolutely comfy staying in Blair\\'s place. It took us 10 to 15 minutes to Seattle downtown and the neighborhood was quiet and beautiful. The Safeway Market was just few blocks away, super convenient! The description on web was accurate. Blair\\'s place was my first airbnb, and it was perfectly match my expatiation. Highly recommend Blair\\'s place! This is the Best airbnb I\\'ve ever had! Blair s place is so homy, morden, and clean! The neighborhood is quiet, and has a lot parking space. The whole experience made me wanna move to Seattle! Highly highly recommended! House was very spacious and clean.   Little patio area outside was awesome.   Neighborhood quiet but still very close to Ballard attractions.   Check in and out a breeze.   Blair was great.    This was my first experience of staying exclusively at an Airbnb in a new city, and I\\'m glad we did! Blair\\'s Ballard house was incredible! So centrally located, clean and modern, with lots of amenities, great soft beds, huge kitchen, and lovely back yard to chill in. We loved the whole experience! Very nice house in quiet neighborhood. Perfect for college visits. They were very helpful. It was easy to get into the house. House was as seen on listing. Walking distance to some restaurants, etc. Easy drive to downtown Seattle.  We had a great time in Seattle and the house was perfect for our two families! We loved the location and neighborhood too.  This house was the perfect one-night stop for us in Ballard. It\\'s nicely tucked away in a quiet neighborhood, yet just minutes from Ballard\\'s town center. The condo is a bit nondescript on the outside, but modern, clean and very comfortable on the inside. Blair is an excellent host, communicative and helpful. Highly recommended.  What a great space for a large group! We felt at home, but still had privacy.  The pictures depict the listing exactly!  It was perfect for the 5 of us - and having access to a washing machine was a godsend (my 3 year old tends to have wardrobe malfunctions several times a day).  The neighborhood is very quiet. It\\'s fairly close to simple amenities (grocery, eateries) - and driving in the area was easy.  On street parking wasn\\'t a hassle - there was plenty! Blair was courteous, helpful and quick to respond to questions.  The home was beautifully clean and well stocked.  My entire family enjoyed our stay. This place was clean, funky, comfortable, safe, and perfect for my family. The all loved it. Directions for checking in and out were clear and consise. Thank you. I\\'ve successfully turned my entire family into Airbnb heads because of this experience! My group and myself had a wonderful stay at this AirBnB rental. The posting was accurate, the home was very clean, comfortable beds, and quiet/friendly neighborhood. \\r\\nThe owner was prompt with communication and once we booked the property all the details were messaged over. It was so seamless and convenient. They even left a book of how to prep the place before departure, things to do in Seattle, which felt very organized and welcoming.  I would absolutely recommend this rental to people visiting Seattle. Thanks for a great trip! A beautiful apartment which was really well appointed and comfortably housed 6 adults. Sadly we were only there for one night so didn\\'t get to enjoy much time in the accommodation. I would certainly go back there. Location was easily walkable to Fremont and it was only a short (approx 10 USD) cab to get to locations such as the Space Needle. Thanks very much to our host!! The host did a great job of communicating with us and has done an awesome job of remodeling this home. The amenities were top notch. Short drive or medium walk to LOTS of great food places in Ballard. REALLY enjoyed our stay here. Would do it again in the future. This place was exactly like the pictures. My family and I had a great time here. Very close to the woodland park and zoo. The apple tree in the back yard smelled great :) Everything was very clean and the kitchen is very spacious. We will definitely recommend this place for families. This place was perfect for our group in Seattle! We had three couples, and everyone had plenty of space and privacy. It was a very comfortable spot to come \"home\" to at the end of that day\\'s exploration of Seattle. The beds were comfortable, the showers were hot, the place was super clean, and Blair was kind and responsive. I would definitely recommend this spot to other travelers! Great location and price for our visit to Seattle. It was easy to access and all we needed for our stay. Blair was quick to respond to my questions before our stay. Plenty of room for our party of 6    This listing description is very accurate!  Blair made this a totally effortless and comfy place for us to stay.   We just showed up got the key out of the lockbox and made ourselves at home.  Everything was laid out and self explanatory.  It was nice to have privacy too.  The neighborhood was quiet and seemed safe, lots of parking on the street.  I really enjoyed the back patio, it was a great place to sit in the fading summer sun.  The beds were like clouds, they were so comfortable, and the gas fireplace was really luxurious. Blair\\'s place is beautiful, immaculately clean, and in a fun neighborhood. Perfect place for our visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor food, I recommend checking out the Walrus and the Carpenter, which was only about a 20 minute walk. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Blair! Very quiet neighbourhood. very spacious units, good from family Flawless AirBNB experience in a nice neighborhood.   The place was clean and the beds were very comfy.  Blair was always quick to respond to any questions and getting the keys was so easy with the lockbox.  Highly recommend! It\\'s super awesome!!!! My friends and I really really love the house!!!!!! The house was very clean and spacious. Absolutely perfect for what I needed! Blair was courteous and accommodating.  Well . . . I know Blair has lots of wonderful reviews. I Wish that we felt the same way as others, but that was not our experience. The neighborhood was ok; close to downtown Fremont area and plenty of street parking. There where three piled high trash cans right in front of front porch steps (so first thing you see and pass to get in to house). Second thing, was lots of weeds in the very small front yard area with empty flower pots. Has potential to be cute . . . but was not. \\r\\nOverall, the place was fine; \"spacious\" kind of but not really (upper bedrooms are on the small side and only 4 can sit at the informal dinning table), clean . . . not really. There were several hairs in the upper bathroom and the rug on the floor was disgusting. We actually washed it ourselves as it was incredibly dirty as were the throw rugs in the upstairs bedrooms. The stairway going down to the family room/bedroom downstairs also looked as though it had not been vacuumed for awhile. \\r\\nWorst of all, there was less than a quarter roll of toilet paper in one bathroom and ZERO in the other bathroom! Needless to say, our first stop was the local grocery store to buy our own TP while the rugs were in the washer (that didn\\'t work properly).\\r\\n\\r\\nLuckily our Japanese guests that we were planning to entertain here came a day later than our own arrival  . . . so we were not embarrassed by the event of no TP and dirty rugs & hairs all around.\\r\\nFinally, settling in, we thought we\\'d watch some college football . . . only to get TERRIBLE reception. Satellite rabbit ears is what you get. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I texted Blair about both issues, he apologized and said he\\'d have TP delivered (the next day) and re: the reception . . . \"The tv is connected to the antenna. You can move it to get better reception.\" My D1 ex-football player son tried for more than 30 minutes to \"get better reception\" so he could watch his friends . . . then gave up in frustration.  Our family has no desire to go back to this property.\\r\\nON a positive note; the beds were very comfortable and the bedding was high quality. Self entry was very easy. Kitchen was \"basically\" stocks. No extras. We found the property to be as advertised:  very nice and comfortable.  We recommend it to others.  However the basement suite was a bit musty. The location couldn\\'t have been more perfect!  We attended a wedding at The Ballard Hotel and were within walking distance.  The home was clean, comfortable and well appointed for our party of 8. \\r\\nA comfortable, well-equipped home in a nice, quiet residential neighborhood.  The place was perfect - extremely welcoming, clean, spacious, just absolutely perfect for what we needed. The beds were super comfortable, there was a washer + dryer for laundry, the basement was a great escape and the location was just a short walk from all of the bars & restaurants that Ballard has to offer. There was literally zero downside to this spot - it was perfect! Thank you so much Blair. A great, private duplex with all the amenities as described. The neighborhood is quiet and well kept--and close to downtown Ballard with cute stores and fabulous restaurants. Beds are very plush, basement was perfect for sleeping babies, parking right out front, and several grocery stores nearby. We\\'d absolutely stay here the next time we are in Seattle. This place is amazing, even better than expected. Blair was easy to work with and very responsive.  Perfect rental for our week in Seattle for my sister\\'s wedding. Our family felt right at home and everything about the house was as advertised. Great experience overall! Everything was wonderful.  Blair did an excellent job of keeping us informed and answering any questions we had.  The home was ultra-clean.  We all enjoyed the place immensely--three generations of us.  Easy access to downtown, yet the neighborhood is also close to Green Lake and there are a lot of  good restaurants and coffee shops nearby. Very nice semi-detached house. The location is very good, just  10 mins to the Pike place market by car. We spent 3 nights there. Comfortable and convenient. The duplex was in a good neighborhood, close to my sister and her husband. My family and I had a comfortable time, although we did wish it was cleaner  (did not seem like the place is thoroughly vacuumed), had additional towels (there were only two towels upstairs and three downstairs which was the bare minimum for the 5 people we were), and that it had cable or better reception.  All in all, it was perfectly located for us, and the pictures reflected the space well. Blair was a very helpful and responsive host.  The home is very inviting and cozy.  Bedding is amazing.  The location is perfect, a quite residential area.  Five stars for sure. The house was absolutely perfect! Very spacious, extremely comfortable beds, a cozy fireplace, plenty of street parking, close to everything - Green Lake, downtown, Ballard, the Zoo, restaurants, etc., and there is a lovely little coffee shop just 2 blocks down from the house - just perfect! I would definitely stay here again and would certainly recommend it to anyone traveling to Seattle!  Blair\\'s place was perfect for us.  It was spacious and comfortable. We were able to make ourselves at home, cook meals, and work together well. It was stocked with all the basics we needed.  Getting around town to various restaurants worked well too.  The host left very easy instructions about the details for the stay in the itinerary, so that was very helpful.  The place actually seemed a bit bigger than in the pictures.  Everything was clean and worked well.  It was a very convenient location since we were flying out of Sea Tac in the morning and went to dinner in the downtown area of Ballard which was only a mile away.  My experience in dealing with Blair was very positive. He is easy to communicate with and responds promptly. His place was exactly as described and clean and very well maintained. I would definitely recommend dealing with him.  Great space and location. Easy walk to heart of Ballard. Perfect for the six of us, wish we could\\'ve stayed a while.  It was great for our needs as we had a party of 8 people. My family of four could stay downstairs which had ample space and my sister and her husband could stay in one upstairs bedroom with our parents in another. Place was clean overall but the sofa in the living room was showing some age. Good kitchen full of all cooking utensils. We did some cooking and also visited a number of nearby restaurants, bars and coffee houses. Ballard is great neighborhood, residential with cool local joints. Recommend brimmer & healtap for higher end dining, veraci for casual pizza, slate for coffee, and Reuben\\'s and Stoup for craft beer. The Sunday farmers market is great as well. All in all very good place and excellent value for our group! We had the best time at Blairs place ! My family of 7 had ample space & felt very comfortable and safe in the neighborhood. It\\'s conveniently located and 10 minutes from downtown & the stadium. We\\'d stay with Blair again for sure, hoping to make it an annual trip ! Aloha !  Blair was an amazing host for one of the best family trips I\\'ve ever had. The space was exactly as advertised. We all fit comfortably and it was so nice to come home at the end of a busy day sight seeing to home away from home. Blair was wonderful to communicate with and I would recommend this property to anyone traveling to Seattle. It is extremely close to downtown, Freemont and has great access to the major highways.  We had a great experience at this property! The home was clean, well equipped, and exactly matched the description/photos provided. We loved the location too! There were many great restaurants within walking distance, as well as multiple bus routes for getting to downtown Seattle (approx. 25 min by bus). I would highly recommend staying here! We have some trouble over the checkin and opening the door, but that\\'s totally our issue. Blair is helpful all the way and the house is great if you are travelling with your family.  Blair was incredibly accommodating.  My family was stranded in Seattle due to weather and he responded within 15 minutes of my initial request and was able to coordinate with a housecleaner within 30.  The accommodations were exactly as described in the description and there was ample street parking available.  I would definitely recommend this listing to someone coming to town in the future. Eric\\'s home was a comfortable home away from home.  We stayed there for 4 nights and the space was spacious enough for three adults and our one year old and everything we needed was provided for.  Because of the wonderfully high ceilings, there is a lot of great acoustics in the place which meant we had to be extra quiet when our son was napping or sleeping.  The abundant windows comfortably warmed up the entire house for us considering it was March in Seattle (not to mention it also made it bright and sunny during the day)!  There are some nice local shops, restaurants and coffee shops a few blocks away which we took advantage of on our daily walks.  Thank you for sharing your wonderful home with us! even more beautiful thank the pictures! amazing location. thank you so much for sharing your home with us Any initial hesitation I had of staying in this zero energy house vanished as soon as I  walked into Eric\\'s spacious, bright and warm contemporary home.  The place was spotlessly clean, new and decorated in a minimal fashion that worked well with both the contemporary and antique pieces around the rooms.  Although the kitchen was well stocked with supplies and equipment which Eric generously offered us to use, we had only 3 nights to enjoy Seattle so we dined out but definitely enjoyed the open concept kitchen and eating area was great for breakfasts.    From the very interesting eco-friendly house construction features such as water-saving dual-flush toilets (the design channels the clean water used to fill the tank for the next flush through the sink on the lid so that when you flush, you simply wash your hands at the same time!), to the solar panels on the roof to collect energy enough to run the entire home (yes even with all the rain!) to the reclaimed building supplies such as in the gorgeous wood floors, my family of 5 gave 2 thumbs up that this was indeed a vey cool and comfortable place to stay.  With regards to location, Ballard is a fabulous central location to explore most places one would want to go when visiting Seattle.  We were at the SOMA & Pike Place market within 10 minutes and just a few minutes to the Woodland Park Zoo.  We enjoyed the little boutiques and unique offerings that  Ballard features including the Ballard Sunday Farmers Market (amazing artisan food selections), to the occasional Viking/Norwegian influences in the neighborhood.  Although we have been to Seattle dozens of times (from Vancouver, Canada) and stayed at 4* hotels previously, we enjoyed this trip immensely as we could feel like a local instead of a tourist again. \\r\\n The accommodations for six of us (4 adults, 2 children) were great. Nice bright home with lots of natural light. Fully equipped kitchen, quiet neighborhood, plenty of street parking, shopping near by.\\r\\nVery modern with great energy saving features.\\r\\nWhat more would you want?  We had a wonderful 4th of July weekend in Seattle. Eric and Alex left a whole book of tips for us that made the trip super easy. The house is beautiful and in a quiet neighborhood, but also close to many attractions. Loved it! Our family very much enjoyed the house. My wife loved the look and feel of the place. I really appreciated the fact that net zero added to the space and in no way felt restrictive or onerous. The kids got a kick out of the Caroma basins. It was warm and comfortable, even as it was snowing outside. Definitely looking forward to staying there again. Eric\\'s zero energy home was simply amazing. We had a surprisingly sunny stay in Seattle and the light beaming through the windows is just magical. His cozy, warm home is nestled into an amazing part of Ballard and we were able to walk or take just a short drive to everything we needed during our stay. While he was out of the country on holiday during the duration communication was seamless. His home also provided an amazing lesson in conservation, while I\\'m sure we generated more trash and used more energy than he\\'s accustomed we realized just how wasteful we are in our daily lives, the ability to spend a week composting and conserving was truly a gift. Did I mention the beds are amazingly comfortable as well? Yes that too! I stayed at Eric\\'s Zero Energy home for a weekend with my family when we were visiting for a July wedding. Eric was great!  He was super responsive to all of my questions and very welcoming.  The house was wonderful.   My family was amazed at how well the house was stocked with everything we could have needed!  It was perfect for what we needed, we couldn\\'t have asked for anything more.   As a bonus, the house was very convenient to everything in Seattle.  I don\\'t think we were in the car longer than 20 minutes to get anywhere - and that included the trip to the airport!\\r\\n\\r\\n I would recommend to stay at this house to anyone! Eric left us  printed information about the house, about Seattle , transportation. Like a true tour guide. Made us feel comfortable. He was in touch all the time by email if anything was needed. The neighbourhood is beautiful, quite far from downtown but we were looking to stay at Ballards. We even took a run from his house to the centre and it is so worth it because there are amazing parks along the river, close to Fremont. Excelent experience  Eric\\'s place is clean, modern, and comfortable. I had a great experience, and would recommend it to anyone! Jamie and David were home when I arrived and gave me a tour/orientation of the basement apartment. They provided a Keurig and a Brita water filter in addition to the stuff in the listing, and they made me feel welcome with tips about local coffee shops, bakeries, and microbrews. We had a lovely conversation when I checked out, as well, and Jamie was responsive to my suggestions for additional items (e.g. tissues). The cottage has Craftsman architecture, lovely landscaping, and sits in a quiet residential neighborhood near Phinney Ridge. Despite the peaceful surroundings, it\\'s a great home base from which to see Seattle... only 20 minutes by car or bus to downtown and 10 to the quirky main drags of Ballard and Fremont. Would absolutely recommend to anybody planning a visit. Jamie was so accommodating and such a wonderful host!  We loved staying here and would definitely stay again next time we come to Seattle.  We rented a car and it was an easy drive into the city, but Jamie told us there is a bus nearby, too.  I highly recommend staying here, especially if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but still have a quick, easy route to downtown.  We spent one night exploring the Fremont area on 36th ave that has really cool restaurants and bars.  Walkable from Jamie\\'s if you want to explore the surrounding neighborhood.  Highly recommended!! This place was great!!  Everything was as described plus some extras-- Jamie left us a bottle of wine, a few beers in the mini-fridge, and even some delicious chocolates to snack on for our stay.  The bed was SO comfortable we didn\\'t want to get up in the morning!  There were plenty of games, books, and puzzles to entertain ourselves with (we ended up playing a lengthy backgammon game while drinking wine).  Jamie was accommodating and friendly; she let us check in early and gave us suggestions for things to do around the area, of which there were plenty (awesome location with restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and parks within walking distance).  If we ever come back to Seattle we are definitely looking her up-five stars!! Jamie\\'s Ballard craftsman is so adorable! The basement apartment was perfectly clean. Jamie was quite accommodating, providing a wifi password, plenty of clean towels, k-cups for coffee, water, and dishes. A bonus: The bed was super comfortable!! I highly recommend staying here!  Wow, great location in Ballard.. Close to everything but far enough away to feel private. This basement apartment has everything you need for a stay in town. Cozy bed, plenty of towels, a large fridge and a little sitting area.  My boyfriend and I booked this accommodation for 3 days in August.  \\r\\nThe place looked exactly like the pictures - private, cute, cozy, and clean, so there were no surprises.  The place was really lovely, and our hosts were very generous with towels and well needed toiletries.  The neighbourhood is a nice residential and close to bus stops that is approx 15 - 20 min downtown with some nice restaurants and shops also a few blocks away.\\r\\nWe like walking and exploring the city like a local, so this wasn\\'t a problem for us.  We noted the suite did not have a t.v. which we thought odd at first, however in the end, we didn\\'t have the time or interest to watch t.v. Plus, we had a laptop and setting up wifi was very fast and easy.  We enjoyed our stay, and would highly recommend.  My first time using airbnb was positive experience overall, on account of our hosts, who I should mention were easy to get in touch with if we had any questions and made the check in /check out process really straightforward. Jamie and David were absolutely wonderful. The apartment was very clean and presentable. It was cozy and perfect for the overnight my parents had planned. I got in touch with Jamie and David before my parents checked in to inform them that they were staying at this place for their 40th anniversary! They were super helpful and allowed me to drop off flowers and arrange some fruit and cheese at the apartment before they arrived. When I came back and dropped my parents off? They had arranged a personal card and a bottle of wine to congratulate my parents! They were just fantastic and I couldn\\'t say enough about how much my parents loved the place. I absolutely recommend this as a great place to stay. This was a lovely space.  Very clean and they even put out a bottle of wine for us.  $12 uber ride from downtown makes this a steal. Very quaint and cozy, beautiful hardwood floor and beautiful home. The bed is very comfortable and there are lots of book and games to entertain. All the amenities you need are available. Jamie is very pleasant, too! Definitely an enjoyable stay! Lovely accommodations and a friendly host available when needed. Place was just as it was described. We will definitely keep them in mind for future travels.  Good location in Seattle, really liked the neighborhood. Although it was a short stay the place was cute and just what I needed for one night Good experience! The apartment was easy to find, great location, very clean, and well equipped. We didn\\'t get to meet Jamie but she is a good communicator, letting us know the code for the lockbox. \\r\\n\\r\\nWill definitely stay there again!  Jamie was absolutely wonderful. The apartment is perfect. We loved the location, the house was spotless and we were made to feel most welcome. Jamie left us a bottle of wine, a little chocolate, coffee.. the bed was sumptuous. It\\'s easy to get around the area with a lot of places in walking distance. We enjoyed meeting Jamie. It\\'s obvious that she has put a lot of effort into making her place a wonderful airbnb experience for travelers.\\r\\nThank you, Jamie! Great place to stay while in Seattle! Jamie and her husband were really lovely and made us feel really welcome. We will definitely stay again while in Seattle! I booked Jamie\\'s place for my parents to stay in prior to going on an Alaskan cruise. It was perfect for their short stay and Jamie even offered to drop them off at the cruise terminal. The place is very neat and tidy with a great location in Ballard. The description of the apartment and the neighborhood was perfect. Thank you Jamie for sharing your home with us. We only spent one night but we could have spent more if we had the time :)  We will definitely book with you next time we are in Seattle. Jamie was an excellent host! We arrived much later than planned and she was more than happy to accommodate our schedule.  There was a bottle of wine set out for our arrival, the towels were soft, and the bed extremely comfortable.  It was wonderful to stay in such a book-filled rental without the distraction of a television.  The rental was clean and cozy and we hated to have to leave after just one night!  We will absolutely be stay again when our travels take us back to the Seattle area! I would recommend this to anyone! Great location - close enough to Ballard to be convenient (and with easy access to downtown) but tucked just a block or two off the main drag, making it feel quiet and relaxing. The photos and descriptions were spot-on. Very clean and welcoming. We got a great night\\'s rest. Ran into Jamie briefly as we were leaving and she gave us a lead on an outstanding local breakfast spot. We had a wonderful time!\\r\\n I loved the space that Jamie had for us. It was a private basement unit with all the amenities that we needed for our 3 night stay. She even set out a bottle of wine and chocolates for us. The bed was very comfortable, everything was clean and updated. Best of all, it was quite :) Jamie was also very helpful- offering suggestions on where to dine and great places for sunsets. And if we needed anything, she was pretty much available. We would definitely come back and book again.  Very cozy and conveniently located.  Close to public transportation, nightlife, good food, and micro breweries. Jaime was an amazing host. Very helpful and friendly. Apartment had all the comforts of home. Just an all around good experience. My wife and I will be staying here exclusively for all future visits to Seattle.  Perfect little pad, great location and very hospitable hosts!  Jamie couldn\\'t have been nicer during our stay!  Although, we were on the move most of our trip, we were able to chit chat with Jamie and her husband the morning of check out.  Bed was very comfortable, apartment was very clean with everything you need for a few nights stay.  I would highly reccommend to anyone working with Jamie and staying at her humble abode!  If and when we come back to Seattle, we would definitely enjoy staying at this Ballard Charmer again!  The apartment in Jamie\\'s lovely craftsman house is just as nice as in the photos!  The place was spotless and the bed is very comfortable.  Jamie was a good communicator.  She let me chose the code on the lockbox but was home when we arrived so gave us a quick tour.  The neighborhood is quiet, near Ballard and Fremont, and parking off street in Jamie\\'s driveway was a bonus.  We will definitely stay here again when visiting our daughter in Fremont! The space was quiet and cozy. Jamie was very welcoming. It was a great place to unwind after busy days exploring the city. What you see is what you get. I was delighted by the cottage, it is exactly like the pictures. Jamie is a lovely host and has all sorts of little things that make it feel homey. She also knows the area very well and helped us find our way when we were lost. The bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood is quiet. The cottage is super clean and I felt safe staying alone. It was a lovely little get-away.  Beautiful place, very clean, very private, excellent bed, great shower, remarkably quiet for Seattle, nice accommodating hosts who laugh at your jokes, parking, good book selection, reasonable price -  what\\'s not to like?   I booked this room for my parents. The biggest draw was location: just a few blocks from my house, in a quiet area well-served by buses to downtown. My parents reported that everything was spanking new and their hostess very welcoming. Communication was great and I felt assured my parents were well taken care of. Thanks! Mom and I stayed here for 2 nights on our mini vacation and we both enjoyed our stay here at the Charmer. Great neighborhood; very safe, quiet, and neighbors are friendly. The charmer itself is very sweet and comfortable. It looks exactly like the pictures. We love the colorful interior and all the little decors. Location and transportation is convenient. We took the bus which is 3 blocks away to and from the zoo and Ballard Lock, each ride is about 10 minutes. We also used Uber and Lyft to get around. About $10-14 dollars from the Charmer to Downtown Seattle, International district, and UW.  Jamie is a very thoughtful host. She provides this very cool coffee/tea maker with a great variety of coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. She also left us a bottle of wine. Thank you Jamie for such an enjoyable experience!!!    Jamie\\'s wasn\\'t available, but her husband showed me to the apartment.  He made me feel very welcome.  The pictures are very accurate--very cute place! Jamie is a great host and made me feel very welcome.  She is very friendly and helpful and her place is exactly as seen on the photos. Really lovely and the bed VERY comfy!!!!  Neighbourhood is very peaceful and quiet and not far from the shops and buses to down town Seattle.  Thanks Jamie. :) Jamie made us feel at home from the minute we arrived. Our apartment had all the amentities that we needed and the bed was comfortable!!  Jamie gave us great suggestions on where to eat and shop.  Quiet neighborhood.  Great place to stay. This is a wonderful space in a quite neighborhood.\\r\\nVery clean with a high quality mattress and consequently a high quality sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would recommend this choice as a place in the Freemont area to anyone. Perfect place to stay.  Clean and quiet.  Hosts were accommodating to a special request.  Host was helpful and answered lots of questions.  Really enjoyed staying here! Jamie was warm and welcoming and great to work with!  We really enjoyed our stay in this very well-equipped, lovely apartment.  We appreciated how quiet it was and slept great in the very cozy, comfy bed.  The space is bright and nicely appointed with everything you need, from a mini-kitchen to deluxe sheets & fluffy towels.  Jamie generously provided some nice treats for our stay, too.  I highly recommend staying here! Jamie\\'s place was immaculate. She has providing everything the guests needs. Clean, cozy and beautiful! Even a bottle of wine and some chocolates! Thanks Jamie! This is a perfect space for 1 or 2 people on a visit to Seattle.  It is very clean and cozy, the heat lamp in the bathroom being an extra special touch on cool mornings!  Jamie was available by phone and offered lots of suggestions from coffee shops to sight-seeing.  She is a welcoming host.\\r\\nI recommend Ballard - though it is a ~30 min bus ride downtown, the Ballard and Freemont areas are charming and a great place to explore.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe. My stay at Jamie\\'s place was short and quite sweet. It is well located in a wonderful neighborhood. The bed is cozy and the shower is great. Had it not been a work night for me I would have indulged in the lovely wine Jamie had waiting for me. This is definitely a place to add to your wish list.  Jamie Ballard Craftsman has provided a wonderful experience on our recent visit to Ballard area of Seattle.  The space is magnificently appointed with close attention to every detail.  We hope to stay again on our next visit with family in this great part of Seattle.  Don\\'t miss the Sunday market in downtown Ballard! The space is super cozy, cute, clean and is exactly as described. The neighborhood is great too, and there are many bus stops around. Jamie was an excellent host and made sure we were comfortable. The apartment was very nice and accurately described in the listing.  Jamie provided parking in her driveway eliminating search for a parking space on the street.  The provisions for a light breakfast or snack were a very nice touch.  The location was very convenient-- close to Ballard and Fremont and convenient to downtown.  Jamie is a very nice host, very responsive to text messages and e-mails, and provides many nice touches in the apartment.  I recommend this listing. Very clean and well organized, with a comfortable bed, adequate linen, blankets and heaters and such thoughtful and delectable additions as wine, chocolates and yogurt.  Completely private with off-street parking.  I was very pleased with the facilities and impressed with the foresight of my host, who, although out-of-town during my stay, left nothing to chance. I had a very quick visit to Seattle and was happy to have a warm and charming space to stay in. There were thoughtful amenities: a Keuring coffee maker, yogurt in the fridge and toiletries in the bathroom. Would recommend to anyone staying in the area!  Nice and clean apartment with lots of little amenities (soaps for shower, wine, chocolates, and yogurt in fridge).  Short ten minute walk to the main part of Ballard.  Jamie was very friendly and easy check in.  Only thing we didn\\'t like was bed is really squeaky so if you turn at night, you wake yourself up.  Also the bed caved in in the middle, so not so comfy for two people I guess.   This was a great place to stay! What a great place! We loved the wine and coffee available to us. The bed was super cozy and the place was so clean! Jamie was very responsive and we had a great first airbnb experience. Thank you! Was just as described and pictures were accurate. Very inviting and clean. A bottle of wine was a lovely touch. We enjoyed our stay! Jamie was great!  The chocolate and wine were a plus.  The place was spotless.  Best pillows ever.  I ended up blowing a fuse by using my hairdryer and the room heater at the same time (same thing happens in my place), and they were able to reset the breaker for me right away.  She even texted me while I was out later to let me know the dome light was on in my car!!  Dead battery crisis averted.  \\r\\nI fully expected to hear people walking around above me, which I didn\\'t.  Would definitely stay again! Jamie did a great job of making our stay comfortable. She not only had all the amenities necessary she gave us suggestions of local restaurants. Here place was very comfortable and cozy. The surrounding area was also very nice and safe. I would recommend this to other traveling to Seattle. This was one of our best airbnb experiences, very tastefully refinished space with lots of attention to the existing character. Jamie was very flexible and generous host. It was a nice cozy place. The heat in the bedroom worked great, maybe a little too great ha. We had to turn off in the middle of the night. The wine of course was a nice addition. Jamie was lovely. She was overly accommodating, but not too much. \\r\\nThe place was quaint, nice and clean. Good bed and bathroom. Coffee from a Keureg. Sofa. A nice place. \\r\\nThank you Jamie.  We enjoyed our stay very much!  Jamie\\'s home was welcoming, comfortable, clean, and very quiet. We hope to stay there again! We had a great night\\'s stay at Jamie\\'s! The bed was cozy and everything was set up for our stay (including coffee!).  We had a wonderful stay at Jamie\\'s perfect little rental! She was an excellent host and communicated everything about the space perfectly. This space was perfect for two people, immaculate, and had everything a person may need and more!  \\r\\nJamie\\'s basement apartment was clean, quiet and comfortable.  It is centrally located, yet on a quiet street.  She lets guests park in her driveway, which is convenient.  She had coffee, yogurt and wine available.  It was a good experience to stay there. Host was very helpful, apartment was nice and clean and very user friendly/comfortable. Neighborhood is awesome and close to Ballard businesses. Great experience overall, would definitely recommend it One again we had a wonderful experience staying here! We felt so welcomed with the wine, chocolate, tea, and coffee available. The place is so comfy and we slept very well. We also love the Mrs. Meyer\\'s hand soap and Trader Joe\\'s products! I would recommend staying here if you enjoy the Ballard and Phinney Ridge area! There are so many great coffee shops and restaurants nearby.  We had a great stay at Jamie\\'s in Ballard -- location was good, the bed and furniture were comfortable, and everything worked!  We especially loved the ottoman to put our feet up, books she shared, and the wine & chocolate bar:) This is a beautiful place, great quiet neighborhood, wonderful hospitality (the bottle of wine was a nice touch). We felt welcome when we arrived because the apartment was spotlessly clean and ready for us.  We appreciated having a place to park in the driveway and motion detector lights to guide our way to the apartment.  The neighborhood is very safe & quiet and has many fun shops and restaurants nearby.\\r\\nThe apartment has a very comfy bed, plus the bed & bath linens are very nice quality.  Having a small fridge, microwave & beverage maker is very convenient, plus the host graciously provides treats like wine and yogurt.  We think it\\'s such an excellent value for the money, we\\'ve stayed here twice! We loved this place!  A friend and I stayed here over a long weekend and were very happy with our experience.  First, the place had an ideal location for us and we could walk (1 -1.5 miles) to any shop or restaurant in the Ballard area.  The neighborhood and all of Ballard were so much fun to explore.  Second, it was really clean, cute, and had a lot of amenities (e.g., iron, hair dryer, shampoo).  We blew a fuse using the hair dryer one day, we called the owner and within a minute (literally) the power was back on - doesn\\'t get any easier than that.  Would definitely recommend this place to a friend! Jamie was an awesome host.  We got to meet her on arrival and she personally walked us to our apartment.  She provided the most amenities out of any place we\\'ve stayed at. The wine and chocolate were the deal-breaker.   She provided many amenities but we did not use them all.  I was so glad to stay there.  Everything was clean and the back area was well lit when leaving or arriving in the dark.  I give her an A+.  Thanks for the pleasant stay and we will look you up again when we visit Seattle. This place was PERFECT in every way. Very clean, very warm, plenty of hot water. The bed was sooo comfortable. I didn\\'t have any of the bottle of wine that was there when I got there mainly because of Seattles great beers, but I did take the chocolate. I hope to use this place in the future. Thank you, Thank you Jamie! Jamie was extremely accommodating and responded immediately to all messages! Great place! I had a great stay. The apartment  was exactly as pictured. I didn\\'t meet the hosts in person but they were very responsive and had many nice extras that enhanced my stay: wine and chocolate, brita pitcher, refreshing bath products, luggage rack in the closet, and a space heater. It\\'s a lower level unit but doesn\\'t feel like a dungeon. The space heater came in handy at night when things cooled down a bit. \\n\\nAlso, this place is in a fun neighborhood. It was a pleasant walk over to the main streets of Ballard for brunch and browsing. Good overall rental. Jamie & Dave are lovely hosts.  The apartment is comfortable and well-appointed.  The location is great.  We walked a couple of blocks for an excellent breakfast.  We will definitely be back!  Dan & Amy Jamie was very easy to work with. The space was really comfortable, clean and very cozy. It\\'s a great neighborhood and an easy walk to downtown. I would recommend any time. Jamie was a great Host! Very cozy home and comfy bed. We will definitely stay again if we are in the area. This was a great place to stay! Jamie was very welcoming, and even provided a bottle of wine and some chocolate. The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful, and it\\'s a great location for exploring the Ballard neighborhood. Lovely, well-appointed apartment in a fabulous Seattle neighborhood. Jamie left wine, chocolate, sparkling water and yogurt! A responsive, conscientious host! Very restful stay. We truly enjoyed our stay at Jaimie\\'s. Her place is very peaceful, quiet, and offers a complete privacy for a perfect stay in Seattle. She was also very helpful with information about public transportations and local attractions to visit around town. We loved the City and already planning our next visit, and know exactly where we\\'ll be staying. Thank you Jaimie. Jamie was great! The place is SUPER clean, quiet and flat out great! I would not hesitate to rent this place again. Thanks Jamie! This was my first Airbnb experience. And I couldn\\'t be more delighted. First, my accommodations were exactly as detailed in the descriptions, a \"Ballard Craftsman Charmer. \" The rooms were impeccably clean, with large fluffy towels, a well made bed and plenty of coffee.\\r\\nThis listing is an easy two block walk from the bus line. The neighborhood is simply lovely. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.\\r\\n\\r\\n We had an excellent experience at Jamie\\'s place. Everything was as advertised, very cozy and comfortable. The Keurig coffee machine, and fridge stocked with yogurt were particularly appreciated, for an easier breakfast every morning.   Staying at Jamie\\'s was a wonderful experience. The suite was exactly as described. It was very clean, quiet, and the bed was wonderfully comfortable. Jamie was an accommodating host. We would definitely recommend this Airbnb!  This was an overall fantastic experience. Jamie was quick to respond to my request and easy to coordinate with. We didn\\'t speak to her too much during our trip, but during checkout and checkin she was super friendly and willing to answer any questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe space itself was homey, private and just lovely. Great location, great place, great host.  What a wonderful experience! Jamie responded quickly and was available for accommodating a late arrival. The neighborhood is lovely; had a fabulous meal at a nearby restaurant; close to many different neighborhoods, Phiney, Fremont, etc. Room was very clean and accurate to pictures. Kurig coffee was a delight to get us going in the morning to the airport. The garden is delightful, especially in the spring. We had such a great time at Jamie\\'s Air B&B. We would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the Ballard area (and you should visit! Ballard is awesome!). \\r\\nThe suite was SUPER clean and had everything we needed. Lots of towels, hair dryers, coffee maker, fridge. Jamie even left us a bottle of wine, chocolate and yogurt! The bed was also super comfy. The house is located in a beautiful neighborhood and walkable to downtown Ballard (about 15 min) We did a self-guided tour of some of the local breweries in the neighborhood and it was the perfect location to start and end our tour. We checked out the awesome farmers market in Ballard Sunday am and enjoyed some of the great shops and resturants. Highly Recommend! Jamie is a great host! :)  Jamie was very hospitable and gave us tips on where to go in the area. The place was cozy and welcoming. It was perfect and just what I was looking for. I would highly recommend Jamie to anyone looking for a place in Ballard.  Absolutely Perfect!  We unexpectedly had a car at our disposal and were able to park in the driveway for our entire stay (street parking is scarce in Ballard).  We made good use of the Keurig and the beer growler provided!  My husband was very excited to find out you can take any growler to any brewery for a fill (not allowed here in San Diego).   The stay at Jamie\\'s was very comfortable. The space was as advertised. It was clean and well stocked with everything needed. The garden was beautiful. I would stay again and recommend Jamie\\'s place to others. Jaime is a generous and welcoming host. The privately accessed unit in the lower level of her home is just right for two - quiet, bright, fresh and immaculately clean in a classic Seattle neighborhood. A great place to stay for long or short periods. Wonderful place to stay in Seattle! Jamie welcomed us with a bottle of wine and delicious chocolate! The apartment is located in a great neighbourhood, full of wonderful restaurants and easy to access public transportation. Jamie was easily available to contact if we needed anything, and provided maps, etc of the area. Awesome little spot, would highly recommend it! I had a really good time in Seattle. The apartment was clean and the bed was just awesome! Jamie was very welcoming and helpfull with everything. Bus stop and grocery stores are in walking distance and it doesnt take a lot of time to get to Downtown. Staying in Jamies Apartment makes your stay In Seattle just more comfortable! We had a great time at the Craftsman. The neighborhood was wonderful and we were able to sleep in later than usual in the comfy bed and basement room. We will definitely be back!

Jamie was responsive and gracious, and the gourmet chocolate and wine left for us  was a very nice touch.  We had a phenomenal stay with Jamie. It was very clean when we arrived, & she provided us plenty of advice towards food options nearby. We were there for simply one night but it was a great experience. We will be back soon!  A wonderful stay in a lovely apartment.  The place is comfy and beautifully appointed, in a great neighborhood. Jamie\\'s craftsman charmer is located in a great community with a very easy commute to downtown Seattle.  She allowed my mom and I to park our rental car in the driveway which made parking very simple.  Upon arrival she provided us with a bottle of wine, chocolate, yogurt, and a Britta water pitcher.  My mom enjoyed the Keurig machine for the days we were there.  The apartment was exactly as described and I would definitely stay here again. I highly recommend Jamie\\'s house for anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle!  Very very welcoming. The most welcoming host I\\'ve had on AirBnb out of about 20. We had an amazing time at Jamie\\'s. The room was very clean and inviting. The location is walking distance to downtown Ballard and Jaime was extremely helpful with providing us with dinning recommendations. The yogurt, coffee, wine, chocolate, Britta water pitcher and cable TV shows Jamie cares about the comfort of her guests. We would definitely recommend this place. Thanks Jamie! Jamie was welcoming and helpful, giving us recommendations on nearby places to eat and things to see. Her apartment was outfitted with all the necessities and many luxuries: coffee, wine, yogurt  and chocolate! The bed was so comfortable and her patio was delightful! Thank you, Jamie!

She was very responsive, helpful and accommodating. Her lovely space was not only very comfortable but perfectly stocked (she even provided wine, chocolate and yogurt!). It was also cleaner than most hotels, I have to believe. We certainly recommend this as a pleasant airbnb experience and would definitely stay there again.  First and foremost: Jamie was a life saver. \\nI had the great opportunity to send a couple hours at Jamie\\'s airbnb while in Seattle for an interview. The apartment was perfect, cute and had all the necessities (Thank you for that Keurig). She even let me know I left my straightening iron and hair brush in my frazzled, pre-interview state. She made it readily available to pick up. \\n\\nCheck in was a breeze. She lives right upstairs and available if you need her. Check out was even breezier.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place, and I definitely recommend staying with Jamie. She\\'s very kind. Very cute, clean 1br/1ba with private entrance underneath the main house. Jamie was accommodating to our weird hours and provided us some good suggestions on sights to see on our trip to Seattle.  My parents were delighted with their stay. They found the apartment comfortable and pleasant. They were delighted at how well appointed and comfortable the apartment was and they suggested it would be great for other visiting family members. They were very happy.  We were warmly greeted by our host, Jaimie, who showed us through the accommodation, which was extremely well presented.  It was in a great neighbourhood with shops, restaurants and transport nearby.\\r\\nJamie was very friendly and helpful with directions and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Thanks Jaimie. Beautiful home! Loved the colors in the guest rooms. We felt comfortable staying the night there. Provided almost everything such as water, coffee, tea and especially the wine! Beautiful wooden floors, lot of games to play. Felt very homey there.  We had a wonderful time thanks to Jamie! The apartment was clean and she provided many extras such as wine, coffee, water and chocolate.  The neighborhood was safe and provided easy access to all the areas we wanted to visit in Seattle.  Our daughter lives in Seattle, so we would love to return. Lovely experience. Friendly and helpful hosts. Nice little space.  Jamie was very welcoming and the accommodations worked great for us! Ballard has a lot of restaurants and bars and it\\'s easy to access Seattle on public transit. Wow. Jamie is the Hostess with the Mostess! If we had spent more days in the area we wish we could have gotten to know her better. The unit was super clean and comfortable, well furnished, and came with a  large quantity of added touches to make our stay more comfortable. Jamie greeted us, took care of us, provided us with information about the neighborhood and city, and genuinely invited us into her home. The bed comfortable and felt cozy and open; it felt like we had rented an apartment, as opposed to a basement. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again if we return to the area.  Jamie\\'s place was immaculate! It was by far the cleanest, cheeriest airbnb we\\'ve stayed in. Thank you for a great stay, Jamie! Jamie\\'s place is adorable. It\\'s small but cosy, has a wonderfully comfy bed and a great shower. She left treats all over the room- yoghurts and milk in the fridge, a Keurig coffee maker with many kinds of coffees and teas, a bottle of wine. The place is perfectly clean and the neighborhood is beautiful.  Great location close to the Ballard neighborhood. Easy walking distance to restaurants and a good spot to explore the rest of the city from. The room itself was very clean and we were made to feel at home. Very much like having our own apartment in the city for a night. Jamie was such a wonderful host. I couldn\\'t ask for a world warm and welcoming environment. Thank you Jamie for being such a wonderful caring host. The place itself was cozy and VERY clean, hotel clean. Well worth every penny.  Jamie was very welcoming and accommodating for us during our stay. She was also very flexible with our arrival time as we got caught up in traffic that evening. Great space with many amenities.  Jamie has provided a sweet little retreat that is clean, quiet, comfortable and in a great location. We were close to stores and restaurants as well as a quick ride into Seattle. Parking wasn\\'t an, as we could use their driveway. \\r\\n We rented Jamie\\'s Ballard Craftsman for our maid-of-honor and her husband who traveled to Seattle for our wedding. While we did not stay in the unit, we did visit and found it to be exceptional! Our guests absolutely loved staying here. Jamie was incredibly nice and accommodating during the booking process which took a lot of stress out of the equation. Great place, great host, great neighborhood! The apartment was sparkling clean, with beautifully chosen furniture, paint colors, and decor. Jamie has an extensive library with a wide variety of books and has provided lots of brochures and guide books about Seattle and the Pacific Northwest. There is a very sweet little sitting area just outside the apartment and the plantings in the garden and yard are lovely. The neighborhood is full of adorable houses and close to everything including Slate Coffee Bar.  The apartment is nicely stocked with everything you need for a comfortable stay--even an empty growler that you can have filled at a local brewpub!   Jamie did a great job at explaining the home and area to us. She wasn\\'t overbearing, and was very easy to get in touch with if you needed anything. The area was great, and so was the house. We were a little disappointed with the comfort of the bed overall, but the house was great besides that.  The outdoor deck was really nice in the morning.   Wow! This was our first time using Airbnb and I have to say we were very impressed. My main thing in staying in a hotel is most definitely cleanliness. Jamie\\'s wonderful apartment was most definitely sparkling. I was a little apprehensive about trying something new but it was definitely worth it.\\nJamie was a wonderful host and interacted with us as much as or as little as we wanted. She gave us wonderful recommendations for local eateries and they were fab.\\nThe apartment was very private, secure and had all the amenities that you\\'d expect in a really nice hotel room and lots more little luxuries. Everything was provided and Jamie was easily on hand for any queries we had. There was abundant seating room inside and a little table and chairs outside. The shower was fab with some lovely chic toiletries and Jamie left some nice foodie treats in the room also. It\\'s the little extra touches like this that made our stay so welcoming. Plus the coffee machine.\\nShe is a very friendly host and like I said is quite happy to chat or leave you to your own privacy.\\nThe apartment was situated in a nice quiet residential area and was a lovely stroll into Ballard Main Street where the are lots of lovely restaurants, bars, boutiques. \\nThe bus is at the end of the road if you need it and Jamie also let us park in the driveway. We parked up for the weekend as it was so easy to get around on foot or public transport.\\nSeattle was a really interesting friendly city to visit. I definitely reccomend anyone to stay in Jamie\\'s. We did and we loved it.\\nThank you Jamie.\\n\\n\\n We wish we could give Jamie 6 stars. We had a short but wonderful stay- charming house in a fun area, but Jamie\\'s attention to little details put this stay over the top. We would stay with Jamie again in a heartbeat.  Jaime\\'s place was so nice and she was so accommodating. She provided us with great directions on how to get there and was waiting for us when we arrived. The apartment was very clean and there was little snacks to munch on. If we had any questions she was always available. We loved the neighborhood! This was a great little apartment beautifully decorated, immaculately clean and well appointed. \\nJamie was a really nice helpful non intrusive host. \\nWe thought that visiting Seattle was about visiting the downtown but Jamie suggested that Ballard (where the apartment is) was an area worth considering- she was right it was a lovely a great place to eat and generally walk around.\\nSo the apartment is great, it is about 30 minutes on public transport from downtown ( pike market etc) but also the local area is great.  Jamie made us feel very welcomed when we arrived. We were welcomed with a bottle of wine. The neighborhood was quiet and relaxing. It was also very close to downtown Ballard. There were tons of restaurants to choose from, and lots to do.  Very, very happy with our stay! Jamie\\'s place was cute, clean, in a great location and just what we needed. Jamie was very accommodating and went above and beyond setting the place up for our stay! We will look her up again if we go back! Jamie was a wonderful host. From the moment we arrived until we left, we felt welcomed and extremely comfortable. It was the perfect location and very close to downtown. Jamie was willing to help us with any questions should we need help. I would highly recommend her listing and would go back if the opportunity presents itself. Thanks so much for the hospitality.  Thank you for the cozy stay.  Jamie was very welcoming.  The neighborhood was quiet, bed good, very clean and loved the shower!\\r\\nGerd Place was clean and welcoming located  in a quiet neighborhood. Jamie responded to emails quickly with clear directions. Place made us feel home after a long day out.  Worth of mention is it is within walking distance to my new favorite coffee shop for coffee tasting.  Great place in an perfect location. One of the most comfortable beds I\\'ve ever slept on. The place was perfect for our 1-night getaway to Seattle. Jamie was able to accommodate us (2 adults, 1 kid) without a problem. The place has everything we needed, and a few nice welcome gifts, which were appreciated. The place is clean, and the Jamie was friendly and knowledgeable.  This was a great place to stay, very clean, cozy, and comfortable. Jamie was super welcoming and friendly without being overbearing in the least. Wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay again or to recommend to anyone else! Even though we arrived late at night, Jaime was so welcoming and informative. The stay area is great because you have your own patio area, own entrance, and she gets you all set up with coffee and yogurt for the morning. She was a wonderful host and the stay area is perfect! Jamie is an amazing host. She\\'s very friendly but she also respects your privacy. The appartment is great and very clean ! Very nice neighbourhood.Nice bed, very nice bathroom, TV, internet and a little patio. We were travelling with a toddler and she even found us a pack and play. We would recommend her place to anyone who wants to visit Seattle !  Jamie was so very nice and accomodating. She has a great plavce for hosting and the place is perfect.  I could not ask for anymore than what she already has in her place for visitors.\\r\\nI would highly recommend this place to all travelers.  My husband and I had a great time on our visit to Seattle and Jamie is partly to thank for that.  Her little apartment was a cozy and perfect for us!  We drove there and ended up getting in late, Jamie still came out to greet us and show us around.  \\nWe were busy the whole week with family showing us around but Jamie kept in contact with me, making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.  Jamie, next time we are in Seattle, we will contact you again! Jamie made us feel very welcome upon our arrival offering suggestions of things to do in Seattle.  The space was perfect to come back and relax from a long day of touring Seattle.  The location was great.  A few blocks from bus stops to take you downtown and to the unviversity of Washington\\'s campus.  Also easy walking distance to downtown Ballard.  I could not recommend this location more. Jamie was an amazing host. Very accommodating with a bright personality. The space was clean, cozy and affordable. We will absolutely stay with her again when we\\'re back in the neighborhood! We loved our stay here!  Jamie is an incredible host, she was so friendly and so thoughtful.  The location of the apartment is great, walking distance to so much that Ballard has to offer and to public transportation.   We loved this neighborhood!  Lastly, the space is perfect, this was a great place to relax after our busy days.  I would recommend this airbnb to anyone visiting Seattle. My boyfriend and I had a great stay at Jamie\\'s listing. We were only in town for about 12 hours, so not a lot of time to get settled in, but everything was fantastic. Jamie very kindly let us check in late, as we were driving to Seattle after work, and even had a bottle of wine waiting for us in the cottage. She had great restaurant recommendations and was quick to see if there was anything else we needed for our stay. Her neighborhood is wonderful - I wish we\\'d had more time to explore! I\\'d definitely recommend staying with Jamie if you find yourself in Seattle.  Jaime was super inviting and helpful when we arrived. Knew exactly where we should get food and a drink within walking distance and welcomed us with a bottle of wine and chocolate! The apartment is tucked in the backyard among an awesome garden and the neighborhood is centrally located.  The Ballard Craftsman Charmer was exactly what my husband and I had hoped for: cozy, comfortable, and clean. It is located in a great neighborhood with easy access to many great areas in Seattle. Jamie was a great host who made us feel at home. My husband and I really enjoyed our stay and plan to visit again soon! We spent one night at Jamie\\'s place and loved it! It was perfect for the one night that we needed it for.  Great bathroom amenities (timer on the fan),  great privacy,  very clean,  and she was super friendly! We would definitely recommend her place to anyone! Great area - very safe & lots of restaurants close by, walk to waterfront. Clean and comfy!! Jamie was a very gracious hostess who was super accommodating to my requests from before I arrived. Her response time was immediate. The apartment is really cute and was very clean and welcoming. Jamie even left a welcome bottle of wine for me, that was a much needed treat after a long day of travel and missed flights. The bed was really comfortable. I was only there for one night so only saw a little bit of the neighborhood, but very quaint from what I saw. I hope to return and would absolutely stay with Jamie again.  Loved the space. The location is perfect. Jamie\\'s place is quite and clean. Jamie was accommodating and gave us our private space. Highly recommended. Jamie is a wonderful host and very accommodating.  Her place is conveniently located and the neighborhood is nice to walk around. The bed is super comfortable.  Enjoyed my stay! Jamie was a great host. The apartment was comfortable, clean, and had everything we needed. The wine and coffee were a nice touch. The location is great: in a residential, quiet neighborhood but within walking distance of a few bars and restaurants, and a short drive from everything else Seattle has to offer.  Jamie was available if we needed anything but the apartment itself was totally private. Had a great stay there- thanks Jamie! Jamie and David are wonderful hosts. The apartment was exactly as it appears on the listing. It seems to be newly remodeled and was sparkling clean, the bed is ultra comfortable, and the linens and toiletries provided are of high quality. Jamie left us some treats...a bottle of wine, an organic chocolate bar, yogurt and organic bananas.  There is one spot for off-street parking and there is a small sitting area outside just for guests. The neighborhood is quiet and there are many good restaurants and activities fairly close by. I can\\'t say enough good things about this perfect little pad. We will be back...definitely. (I\\'m writing this review on behalf of my parents, as well as myself. I live near this location in Ballard, but my apartment was just too small to comfortably accommodate for their visit. Basically - they were really happy I found this place!)\\n\\nIf you\\'re planning a trip to Seattle but still want the comforts of home with a hospitable host, I\\'d highly recommend staying at Jamie\\'s! Her home is beautiful and cozy, located on a safe residential street in the very popular Seattle neighborhood of Ballard.\\n\\nWith this apartment style stay, you get all the essentials - including a very nice bathroom/shower and extremely comfortable bed - plus some extras, including a Keurig coffee maker with a huge assortment of K cups! That was definitely nice to have on hand for the chilly Seattle mornings and evenings.\\n\\nSo lovely, A++\\nWould stay again! This is a lovely apartment in the basement of a beautiful home. It is comfortable and well appointed with toiletries, snacks, drinks, a fridge and a microwave. The bed is large and comfy. There is off street parking. It is convenient to the totally hip Ballard neighborhood. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Jamie was super communicative & prompt in helping me find a place to house a member of my production crew so quickly when it was a last-minute request. People like her who go above & beyond to help make accommodations in her fantastic location are exactly the reason I like using Airbnb to put up my crew during a film shoot. Thanks Jamie! Cute, comfortable, and convenient little spot! Jamie and David were very responsive hosts, from answering questions pre-trip, to check-in, touching base during my stay (not intrusively) and on my check-out. They responded to a couple queries early in my stay about the heat and the Keurig, which was much appreciated. The place was SUPER clean and as pictured. Queen bed was comfy; lots of nice towels provided. The treats provided (wine, chocolate (yes!), yogurt and bottled water in the fridge, bananas on the counter) were certainly a lovely surprise. The pix illustrate, but I\\'d failed to put two and two together, that there is no sink in the kitchenette, so I hand washed in the bathroom sink. Jamie did offer to pick up any dishes needing washing, but as I only did breakfast there, that wasn\\'t necessary.  There IS a hair dryer (think the listing details don\\'t indicate that). I will look them up again; they\\'re super convenient to my kids and granddaughter, and that\\'s what counted for me. Thanks for a very comfortable stay, Jamie! We have only great things to say about our stay at Jamie\\'s lovely Ballard space. The space was cozy and exceptionally clean. Jamie was an excellent communicator - flexible and accommodating. Loved the Theo chocolate. We would visit again. My friend and I had the most wonderful weekend stay at Jaime\\'s!  The place was so cute, and so clean, and Jaime was so sweet to leave wine, chocolate, and coffee.  Jaime responded right away to our questions and checked in to make sure we were having a comfortable stay.  We felt like we had a home away from home during our weekend visit. Thanks, Jaime!  She met us when we arrived to be sure we had all that we needed ? The neighborhood is fabulous. All was as advertised. This is a basement (half of the basement) small apartment, with daylight door and window looking out under a deck. The overall environment is pleasant and comfortable.  Thank you Jamie and David , you have a nice clean quiet place that we simply enjoy, thanks again for all the snacks and the nice bottle of wine. The bed is so comfortable , and the shower has immediate hot water my husband says you must have a. Constant pressure system in your home, it\\'s great to have all the television channels to choose from though we only watch the news in the evening. Thank you again will be sure to look you up next time were in Seattle!! Absolutely unforgettable experience! Great location just minutes away from the ballard ave. in a hip neighborhood not too far from the beach too! The house was absolutely lovely and we had lots of room to spread out. Joe is one of our favorite airbnb hosts and gave us excellent recommendations for bars, restaurants, things to do etc. He\\'s such a cool dude with so many awesome stories to tell so getting to know him was one of the highlights of our trip. If you\\'re lucky enough to have dinner with his family, there are some excellent chefs in the house! Joe was a wonderful host. He\\'s very accommodating and has spot on recommendations for where to go in Ballard. The room itself provides plenty of room for one or two and has air conditioning which was critical on the hotter days. Would highly recommend for anyone who wants to get to know Ballard.  Joe and his family were wonderful hosts! We felt very welcome in their lovely home and cozy up on their third floor. Their home is in a great location with easy parking and access to the rest of the city.  Even though it was a rare heat wave in Seattle, there was an air conditioning unit in the room that we turned on for a bit before bed which was perfect. We received great food tips (Salmon Bay Cafe!) and advice about the community and city in general. What a pleasure! We\\'d happily stay with Joe and his family again.  Staying at Joe\\'s Place was exactly the right thing to do in Seattle. Joe was very helpful, he picked us up at the Bus Station and showed us interesting parts of Seattle. He seems to know everything about this City. Very interesting. His whole Family was very welcoming. We had an excellent time.   We had a very pleasant stay at Joe’s. He and his wife were extremely welcoming and went out of their way to answer all our questions. The room was both comfortable and quiet, and Ballard is a perfect location for exploring the city. It’s a great place to stay. I highly recommend staying here. Joe was an exemplary host. He was very welcoming and was interested to hear about what we had planned to see and do in Seattle. Location is great, lots to see an do within walking distance. \\r\\n\\r\\nJoe knows where to go! He recommended several great places to visit and eat at and made us feel totally at home.  We had a very good stay at Joe\\'s house.  It was GREAT value for the price. The location was excellent and the baby didn\\'t cry much while we were there. Everything was VERY neat and clean. No trouble parking in front of the house every night. The family was quite nice and we had the privacy we wanted.\\n\\nAt first we were unhappy to have to share their bathroom, but it actually turned out fine. We were able to use it every time we wanted and it was very clean. The shower had good pressure and lots of hot water.\\n\\nWe would certainly stay there again. Joe was the first person we ever book with. He was avaliable to talk to and quick to respond to messages. He gave suggestions for the area. He and his family were wonderful. Joe was a great host. He and his wife were so nice to us and we loved spending the night talking with them on their porch! Joe had great suggestions for the Ballard area, and we appreciated the openness of their house. Their home is warm and super artistic. The kids were great, and super cute as well. If you\\'re in Seattle and love interacting with a wonderful family, this is your spot! Thanks so much, Joe, for being so wonderful and we hope to come back to Seattle soon. Joe is a warm and welcoming host who does not resemble his photograph.  The room feels private on an upper floor and was clean and comfortable. An AC helped cool it down. The shared bathroom is on the main floor. We would have liked the bath to be a bit cleaner. Still, we would be happy to return. The neighborhood (Ballard) is great. Joe and his family made us feel right at home!  The room was comfortable and clean. The house is in a great location to explore the Ballard neighborhood by foot, and convenient to getting around the rest of the Seattle area.  Joe had wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to see and do around Ballard - we really got a taste of the neighborhood rather than being in a hotel in the midst of tourist attractions. This was a really unique way to experience Seattle! Joe was a great host and he provided us with all the information we needed to discover the neighborhood and the rest of Seattle. The location was great, too. We took the bus into the city from just around the block, and there is much to see in walking distance. It was also nice that we had our own little space on the 2nd floor.  The listing was just as described, lots of room for me and my travel companion.  Joe was very accommodating to my erratic travel schedule.  I\\'d book with him again.  I had every intention of hanging out upstairs and doing my own thing  for the duration of my stay, but Joe\\'s family were so friendly and kept drawing me in for conversation.  An excellent host, and their house is at a great location for using the bus! Joe was very friendly and welcoming.  He answered any questions we had, made suggestions and helped to point us in the right direction.  The house is in a nice area of the city with a great Sunday farmers market.  The room was clean and comfortable.   I am so happy I decided to stay here! I was looking for a night to relax and that\\'s exactly what I got. Joe and his family were very accommodating and I would stay with them again.  This is my first Airbnb experience. My mom and I had a great time staying with Joe and his family. The location was also great for exploring both the neighborhood and the city of Seattle. Bus stop is just walking distance from Joe\\'s house. Joe and his wife had wonderful suggestions for things to do during our stay. Their kids are super cute as well! \\r\\nJoe\\'s wonderful family made my mom and me feel very comfortable at home. I highly recommend staying at Joe\\'s place if you come to Seattle. Cannot recommend this place enough! The house was within walking distance to an incredible assortment of stores and restaurants. Who needs downtown Seattle? Joe was ridiculously accommodating and always willing to offer amazing advice on what to see and do. The upstairs area was clean and comfortable. No complaints!  Joe made us feel at home by putting up with our difficult travel schedule and giving us great advice on things to do in the city.  House was clean and is a short bus ride to downtown seattle. Also walking distance to great bars and restaurants.  Joe is a « natural » host, making people feel instantly welcomed. He was always available when we had questions and of good company. About staying in Ballard, we were at first a bit afraid to be far from downtown Seattle. But the public transportation work just well and Ballard is a sympathetic place to discover. Joe and his family were very welcoming. Accommodations were simple and great. We didn\\'t need much. He also shared some space in the fridge for some food items and snacks we bought. The location was easy to find and the neighborhood was quiet with lots of restaurants and bars not too far away. We felt comfortable there and would definitely stay there again! He is what everyone has said and more. As Airbnb lists...a super host for sure! This listing is in a great location for people looking to check out the Ballard area. Every restaurant and brewery we wanted to hit was a 5-10 minute Uber ride away. It was also really convenient to get to Pike Place, Chihuly, and other central sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we didn\\'t get to meet Joe because he was out of town, he arranged for someone else to let us into the house. He was flexible with our late arrival time, and the spacious, clean bedroom and bathroom were exactly what we needed to get our bearings after a long day of driving. We were able to park in the driveway because no one else was home, but there\\'s also plenty of street parking right outside the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur stay in Seattle was only two nights, but we would definitely recommend this listing! Very comfortable and welcoming home.  Joe made us feel instantly welcomed, it was really neat having a family host us as we were traveling with kids too. Our baby had a blowout in the car and Joe immediately set us up for a bath in the baby tub. Beds were comfy, room was clean, we felt comfortable staying here. He suggested a variety of downtown Ballard restaurants, we ended up eating at the Kickin\\' Boot for dinner. I loved talking to his wife who was also nursing a young baby at the time, I felt like I could really relate to our hosts. Our son enjoyed playing with theirs and Joe made us a cup of coffee on our way out to Seattle. I arrived at Joe\\'s later than I thought so I didn\\'t have a lot of time there. I found the family kind and inviting. I had an early morning but  Joe offered me a chance to go grab a pint with him and his brother at a local pub and pinball. The place was great . After hanging with these two I\\'m sure I\\'ll be back to Joe\\'s on my next trip through Seattle. Location is walking distance to food,shops and local brew. Joe was great! He was truly welcoming and a wonderful host. He gave us advice on great places to eat, directions to parks, and tips on renting. His kids and wife were so sweet and nice. The accommodations were neat and quiet. Just what we were looking for! Joe is a very nice host, and he had me laughing as soon as he opened the door.  :)  He was very welcoming, showed me our upstairs rooms (both very sweet), bathroom and the general set up, and from there we had some fun conversations, for the little time we were actually there. We\\'re hosts too and needed a place to stay for the night.  His home is very close to Ballard (just less than a mile or so), and has good street access to the rest of the City.  A good place to stay for sure! The house was alright but the host was really nice. We spent two nights at Joe\\'s place in Seattle, Ballard neighborhood. Joe and his family are very welcoming, nice hosts! We had a nice time there. There\\'s a bus stop really close to Joe\\'s place: it takes about half an hour with the bus number 40 to downtown Seattle. In Ballard neighborhood on walking distance there are a lot of nice pubs and restaurants! It\\'s good for a weekend in Seattle! If you\\'re booking last minute, Joe will be ready to answer you request and help you! Recommended! The stay was very convenient and restful. Would recommend staying here for anyone. Tho they had children, they were very respectful of privacy. We felt very \"at home\" here. A wonderful place to stay! Joe and Lillian were wonderful, welcoming hosts, and it was a joy meeting them. The rooms were great--comfortable and as advertised and the location was cute. Would definitely recommend and stay again! Our stay at Joe\\'s was an excellent experience. Joe was very accommodating to our late arrival and offered fantastic advice for local places to get breakfast/coffee. The accommodations were as described and we felt very welcomed. It was a pleasure staying here. It was very cozy house, that looks exactly as on the pictures. Close to the city and in good neighborhood, would stay again I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Ballard Cottage. The room is clean, quiet and comfortable (especially the bed). The hosts Heather and Grant could not have been more hospitable and accommodating. They are really willing to go the extra mile to make sure their guests are happy and have everything they need. They gave me great suggestions for parks to visit in Seattle and also let me know that one of the days was Smithsonian sponsored free museum day! Their recommendations really made for a great weekend. The location is prime with tons of shops and restaurants in Ballard within walking distance or a couple minutes in the car. The Sunday farmers market is great and less than a mile walk. I had a great time in Seattle thanks to Heather and Grant! Heather and her husband were there when I arrived to show me around, answer questions, and introduce me to a few of the cats. They quickly ran through all the important info, then left me to settle in. I didn\\'t see them again while I was there, but Heather was very quick to respond to messages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Airbnb is a converted garage next to a house in a cute and quiet residential neighborhood. It\\'s about a mile walk downhill to most of the shops and bars in Ballard. Heather was a good host and responded very fast to help us complete our reservation. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we arrived, her husband showed us around the cute cottage and their yard plus some handy tips to help us to enjoy our stay and explore this wonderful city. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a quiet and peaceful place to stay and easy to access most areas around Seattle.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, you might have some little kitty visitors around late night or early morning. So... if you love cats, this cottage could be one good place to stay for your next journey in Seattle ; )  Great location very close to the heart of Ballard. The place is adequate for a couple that want to stay close to the best area in Ballard where most restaurants are. Walking distance to ballard\\'s farmers market Super great people. The place was very warm and cozy. Bed was surprisingly very comfy.  Heather\\'s place was great! Check in and check out were a breeze and she was very easy to communicate with. The bed, even though it is a pull out couch, is super comfortable - overall a lovely, quiet place to stay in Ballard!  Great place to stay, very comfortable and in a great location. The hosts were very friendly and helpful. I would say that if you are allergic to cats you may want to avoid this, as their kitties are in the area. But if you are a cat lover like we are, then it is fun to have little furry friends around! We would definitely stay here again! Oh, and ample free parking is a huge plus! Our room was like a studio apartment, behind the main house facing their gardens.  It was very private and quiet.  You slept on a comfortable Queen hide-abed.  The unit also had a small refrigerator, toaster oven, coffeemaker, and a microwave oven for us to use, with all the necessary silverware and dishes. \\r\\n  My husband appreciated the complementary bottle of wine and beer.  I loved the good selection of teas.\\r\\nThe location is in a nice residential neighborhood, yet near many wonderful restaurants in the Ballard area.   \\r\\nWe enjoyed our stay.  \\r\\n Lovely place! The place was great and Jeremy and Rachael did an amazing job at responding to messages very promptly! Also great location!  The studio is really great, much bigger than you can tell from the photos, with very comfy (king) bed & couch and really nice shower.  I was surprised at how much I liked the mural - the whole place feels very metropolitan.  Everything worked great, albeit they are waiting for special-order blinds to arrive, which will make a welcome addition :).  I generally don\\'t cook while on vacation so the micro-kitchen was just right, there were little labels for light, heat, etc. that were helpful, and the building was very secure and quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nJeremy was incredibly hospitable and responsive, above and beyond, I will definitely try to stay here next time I\\'m in town. Staying at Jeremy and Racheal\\'s place for our honeymoon was awsome. Jeremy met us on arrival and was so friendly and welcoming. The studio is much better then the pictures described. Very spacious, awesome, fun art work and beautiful natural light with freshly installed curtains for privacy at night. It is right on 15th but from inside we couldn\\'t hear anything. We enjoyed the sonos speaker and had a very relaxing day of music, wine, and local cheese from pike market. There were snacks, coffee and drinks already inside, which is awsome after a long flight. At night you will fall in love with this bed, and Omy comforters, we never wanted to leave them. So fluffy and warm. The best part is the bus stops are right across the way, so no need for a car, we just jumped on the Dline for a quick 20min ride to pike. The public transportation is so clean and enjoyable, just kick back and take in the scenery. No need for missing all the beauty of seattle because your watching your gps. Perfect location to avoid the hustle and noises of the city at night with easy access to the downtown life and all major attractions at any other time. We used uber a few times when we were exhausted but never spent over $10 on a ride. Whether we were going to the space needle, fremont troll, pioneer square or pike market everything was within reach, just a quick bus ride. Make sure to grab a free bus transfer pass good for a few hours for on off privilege. We will definitely stay at one of jeremy and Racheal\\'s properties for our next visit. Side note, our family and friends loved coming over to play shuffleboard.  My husband and I just returned from 5 nights at the Ballard Studio and found it to be a great base for our Seattle vacation.  I appreciated the convenience of the keyless entry, parking was easy, the studio had everything we needed and more (wish we had more time for the wine and snacks!) and Jeremy could not have been more accommodating.  We had a little trouble with Chromecast and a brand new TV was installed almost immediately.  These are hosts who really care about your experience in their rental.  We love Seattle and will definitely check with Jeremy and Rachael first when we visit again.  Ellen made sure I had all the information I needed prior to my arrival. The main door has a pad code lock on it. Unfortunately it was not operating properly when I arrived so I had to contact Ellen. Ellen was out of town during my visit but she was able to send her daughter to my rescue within 10 minutes of texting Ellen. \\r\\nMy family stayed in the Entertainer unit and we loved it. It was spacious and homey, much better than staying in a hotel room. Especially since we have an 8 month old. \\r\\nThe house sits on one of the Main roads of Ballard and even with the main road that close the neighborhood was still peaceful and quite. We were also in walking distance to a grocery story, bakery, and family that we were visiting. Plus we were on one of the main public transportation routes that went all the way to downtown Seattle. \\r\\nThe only issue that we had was the front door lock. Hopefully this can easily be fixed. I definitely recommend this location to anyone wanting to stay in and around Seattle.  An oasis of calm. Thank you so much for welcoming us into your home. \\r\\n- Fern Dani was very welcoming and had great recommendations for spots to  check out in the area, as well as being very communicative and available to answer our questions. Her home was true to the photos and description, a very comfortable place to stay with all the essentials. Additionally, the neighborhood cannot be beat!  Dani was great host and the apartment was exactly how it appeared on Airbnb  - super cute, clean, great location.  I wasn\\'t rushed to get out on Sunday, which was really nice.  I would definitely stay there again.   We loved staying in Dani\\'s place. It was convenient to everything in Ballard, including Old Ballard where we spent New Year\\'s. I just only stayed there for a night, the rest of the rent were my mom and my brother. But i think Farah and her boyfriend are very kind, they always try to help us with anything. My mom and my brother are very happy when they lived there. If i can go back to Seattle, i will stay in there house for sure :). Absolutely im gonna suggest them for my friends.  This was a nice stay, good location in Ballard. The keybox was handy for when I needed to arrive while Farah was out. Farah was able to accommodate my boyfriend and me with only two days advance notice. She is very responsive and flexible. Her place is very close to bus stop, bakery, and restaurants. Everyone at her place was very friendly. Thanks Farah :) All good.  My stay in Ballard was quite pleasant. The room is as pictured and described. The neighborhood is quiet and the house is a short walk to a bus that will take you directly downtown. Farah was a great host and helped me figure out the best ways to travel around.  I would stay here again.  Though I did not get to meet Farah, her place was great and in a good spot just a short walk from lots on interesting things. It was a quiet space with clean shower, farah was quick to get back to me when I had questions, and totally awesome for letting me crash on short notice! Definitely recommend!  It was wonderful and Farah was very kind with me as I arrived late.  The bedroom is just as the picture shown. Comfy and clean. Farah and her boyfriend are nice. They handed us a guidebook when we arrived and told us where to go. We had a pleasant stay at the house. Ohh and Farah, I will definitely tell you if I can squeeze into the crowd in Time Square on new years eve lol Farah and Ben were warm and hospitable.  Both were helpful with suggestions.  The place is nice and convenient as it\\'s a few minutes away from downtown and transit.  I\\'d recommend it!! Farah was very friendly and accommodating.  The bed was comfy and I had a beautiful sleep.  The bus to downtown was only a couple minute walk away!  Great stay. Nice, cute house in a great location. Room was nicely kept with a full length mirror and right by the bathroom. Farah was very nice and helpful.  I had a very pleasant experience to say the least! Parking is no issue and the neighborhood is safe and very walkable. You are walking distance from restaurants and museums. I would highly recommend staying with Farah. Farah was so welcoming and accommodating on short notice!! The room was accurately portrayed in the listing pictures.  Farah is the biggest sweetheart! She was more than accommodating in her home. The room was perfect and a beautiful 10 minute walk down to coffee shops, bakeries, and stores.  Nous avons du attendre un bon moment à sa porte; le mail avec les instructions a été posté dans la matinée du jour de notre arrivée ; nous avons contacté farah avec un phone français; à son arrivée elle rigolait de la situation et ensuite il a fallu tout demander ( le wifi ,le linge de toilette); lit correct mais il faut soulever la porte  pour  fermer la porte un gond cassé;  Had a very enjoyable stay at Farah\\'s house.  She responded promptly to questions that I had and was very accommodating with an unexpected change in my travel plans.  The room was very cozy and just as described.   My room was exactly as pictured. The house was quiet, neat and clean at all times. Farah responded to all inquiries no matter how trivial both quickly and thoughtfully. The house rules were simple clear and sensible. Meeting Farah was an absolute delight. I will definitely stay here the next time I am in the area.  They are perfect My partner and I arrived on a holiday weekend and Becky & Len weren\\'t home but left the keys in a safe place. We actually stayed in the Tiny Sugar Shack trailer parked in the driveway, which was quite cute. It is a little colorful trailer they drove cross-country in from MA. We were allowed in the main house which had the bathroom. The main house was also quite lovely. Overall, would definitely stay here again. Becky has nice taste and the house is in Ballard, which is a wonderful neighborhood. Not a LOT of places are in walking distance, but we had a rental car which we could get around in.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Ballard!  This home is cozy & the owner is in the process of remodeling it.  Many updates are yet to be made, but it is quite liveable at the present.  The location gets a thumbs up for walkability!  We were able to walk to our son\\'s apartment, restaurants, breweries, coffeeshops and the farmer\\'s market.  Our stay also coincided with the annual Seafoodfest!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe initially had problems with the Wifi codes provided, but did get that resolved.  Interestingly, we learned during these communications that the owner was actually in the midst of her own wedding preparations!  She got married the weekend we were in her home!    \\r\\n\\r\\nWe would definitely return if this home is available the next time we visit!  Great quiet neighborhood, house was just as described. Becky was great and extremely fast at communicating. She left us a cute welcome note and much needed instructions on the coffee maker! The gypsy trailer was awesome, a definite added bonus! I would definitely stay here again! Becky was a fantastic host. Great communication, went out of her way to make sure our group had everything we needed. The location was a short walk to the heart of Ballard (about 15 min walk) and was perfect for a weekend of exploring Seattle\\'s north end.  Becky\\'s house is comfy, super adorable, and artfully decorated. There\\'s a park nearby in this quiet residential neighbourhood and the zoo\\'s within walking distance (about 30-40 mins on foot), which was perfect for us as we were travelling with a toddler. Becky\\'s two cats were really cute and no trouble to care for, but sharing the space with pets may not be ideal for anyone who has allergies or isn\\'t a cat person.  The listing is exactly as advertised - very cozy little home, quiet neighborhood, adorable kitties. We really appreciated the extra heater in the bathroom and the coffee/tea and granola for us in the morning! Nice comfy bed, and an overall great experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is a little far from anything - at least we weren\\'t able to find groceries or anything close by, although we weren\\'t there for very long, and this didn\\'t really affect our stay. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Katie was a wonderful host. I arrived late, after an event, and she was very willing to wait up for me. The room was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed morning coffee and conversation with Katie at her kitchen table.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely stay with her again - Ballard is such an interesting area of Seattle! Her house is very close to shops and cafes. We had a great time staying with Katie!! She had a beautiful house, a very friendly cat and was a joy to talk to! She was very helpful with the Seattle area and even helping my friend with apartment hunting! I would have happily stayed longer and would love to stay again! Katie was a fantastic hostess, and her home was beautiful. I plan to stay again when I\\'m in town again. Recommend highly!! I enjoyed my stay with Katie.  Her home is clean, quiet, and inviting.  Katie also provides just enough interaction on various interesting topics.  A good location for anyone wanting to experience life in the Northwest.  Close to downtown Ballard and short commute to Seattle.  P.S. Her cat is very affectionate. It was a quick hassle free stay. Katie is a wonderful host. The room was great and the neighborhood offers so much within the surrounding few blocks not to mention so close to downtown. Be sure to check out the Ballard Farmer\\'s market on Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'ll be back!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you Katie. :)  We enjoyed our stay in Katie\\'s place. The room and the house was clean and confortable. Also well located in a quiet neighborhood close to nice caffees and restaurants. Katie was a great hostess being very friendly and helpful giving advise about how to organize our visit to Seattle. Highly recommendable. This was a bright and beautiful place that i would for sure recommend anyone to stay at. She was very nice and easy to talk to. I wished i stayed a few more nights. It was clean and perfect.  So thankful that Katie was willing to let me stay with her even though I could not make it on the day I was supposed to come! I had a very restful time at her place. And I felt like I knew her for long time. Would definitely stay with her if I ever need a place again. Thanks Katie! \\r\\n\\r\\n Katie, her kitty, and her lovely house are AWESOME. We absolutely loved our stay and felt very welcome and comfortable. It was especially endearing to wake up and have a fluffball waiting to cuddle :) Highly recommend Katie\\'s place to anyone looking for a nice, convenient stay with a great host. Katie was a great host, made coffee in the morning, gave recommendations for city sightseeing, everything was perfect. The area is absolutely quiet and very nice and reaching downtown via the nearby bus station was very easy. Thank you very much! I five days at Katie\\'s place and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. The room is clean and warm and Katie definitely makes you feel at home. She was very helpful in suggesting sights to see in the city and great local cafes. Her home is located on a quiet street within walking distance of the trendy Ballard shops area, which also has a great farmers market on the weekend. The waterfront marina area is also close. Enjoy!  Katie was a great host, and the place was just what I was looking for. I had an interview the following day and just needed to be well rested. It was clean and quiet and Katie even broke out the iron and ironing board for me! She also has a very affectionate, very sweet kitty that kept me company:) A great experience, I would recommend Katie\\'s place highly! We had a great stay with Katie. We were in town for some meetings and only stayed one night but Katie was very friendly and helpful. The apartment was very clean and the bedroom was beautiful. We had no problems at all during our stay. Nice place. Comfy and cozy. Katie and Lexi the cat are really friendly. A bit out of the way but public transit takes you right to the city. We had a fantastic time at this lovely apartment on our visit to Seattle. Katie is a wonderful host, she gave us some tips on sights to visit downtown and helped us plan the next step of road trip. Her place is very inviting in a quiet neighborhood, which is also very convenient to the city center. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting Seattle - adorable cat Lexi made our stay even more enjoyable  We had the most fantastic time with Katie, this was our first Air B n B experience and couldn\\'t have been better.  Her place is great, the room so comfortable and clean and she was a wonderful host - very down to earth and friendly.  Couldn\\'t recommend it more highly.  Oh and Lexi the cat is a gem. after Alaska cruise, we were a little bit tired. so we wanted to stay house in preparing of next schedule(Canada travel...). the house was cozy and clean and owner trusted me to be out into friend\\'s house. my family stayed like our real house..thanks...   Katie\\'s house is so lovely! Gorgeous bathroom, a great light room and super comfy bed. We stayed for an entire week and loved the neighbourhood - the street is super quiet, the houses are really pretty and Ballard is amazing. The bus is easy to get to if you don\\'t have a car, too. And Katie was amazing, so welcoming and flexible, great to talk to and she even drove us downtown when we had to get to the airport. Couldn\\'t recommend staying here more! We miss you and Lexie! We had a great stay with Katie, She was flexible, generous, and made us feel welcome. She shared great ideas about ways to spend our evening while in Seattle and we felt right at home. Her sweet kitty Lexi was a fun bonus! We would definitely stay with Katie again :) Katie is a great host and easy to communicate with via phone or email. The bedroom was clean and well kept with the bathroom just steps away. Staying with Katie was a wonderful experience. It is amazing that someone can open their home to a stranger and by the end of a stay, become good friends.  I loved my stay with Katie!  Her home is so charming as well as the lovely yard that I spend much time in.  I was visiting my daughter who recently moved to Seattle and had also stayed with Katie while looking for a place to live.  My daughter highly recommended that I stay at Katie\\'s for part of my trip and she was right!  While my daughter was at work as a chef in a local restaurant, Katie and I went to dinner twice to visit her.\\r\\nI would absolutely stay with Katie again and would HIGHLY recommend her place.  She is a native and is so knowledgeable about the area- I learned a lot from her.\\r\\n  We stayed at Katie\\'s home one night only, but our experience was extremely positive:  Katie is very friendly, welcoming, accomodating, and easy going.  We really felt welcomed to her place.  She also provided us with info on public transportation, and even gave us a ride to the bus stop!  The room, bathroom and all common spaces were very bright, clean and tidy.  Finally, Lexi the cat was an added plus to us. We had a very short but nice stay with Katie. She was extremely accommodating, even let us use her ironing board and gave us lots of suggestions about what to do around town. It was a little hard to get our bags up and down the stairs (the yard is kind of steep) and the bathroom is shared, but the room was clean and we really appreciated the hospitality! Where to begin! This was my first time using something like airbnb and it was way beyond my expectations. That of course was due to Katie Logan! Not only was the room charming, clean and spacious(there were two of us), but the hostess thought of the little things- amenities like plush towels, an iron and ironing board, brochures and maps, even an umbrella- it is Seattle after all, though we had great weather. In the bathroom there was a tiny vase with fresh lavender; out back a lovely outdoor seating area. Katie herself is a life long resident of Seattle and had a wealth of knowledge for visitors. \\r\\nAnd then there\\'s the inimitable Lexi the cat! Friendly and welcoming as her mistress. \\r\\nIn all I would highly recommend Katie Logan\\'s home as a choice find. You won\\'t be disappointed! Great place to stay in Ballard.  Katie\\'s place is very clean, bright, and airy and the guest room is very spacious. Parking right in front of her house was easy and the neighborhood was very quiet at night even though it was pretty close to the nightlife of downtown Ballard. Katie and Lexi the cat were both very friendly and welcoming and made it easy for me to feel at home during my stay. Highly recommended. Katie was a wonderful host and we had an unforgettable time at her place!! She contacted us ahead of time to arrange for our arrival, had left the keys somewhere we could easily find them (as she was not home when we arrived) and was very thoughtful throughout. Her place is really cosy and spotless clean. The wifi connection is good. The very nice weather allowed for a couple of lovely breakfasts in the backyard. Ballard is an awesome neighborhood with plenty to do. Bus #40 is nearby and takes you to downtown Seattle in 20-30 minutes. Oh, and Katie even gave us a ride to downtown Ballard so that we could pick up out rental bikes. All in all, a five star experience! We would have stayed much longer if we could have. Can\\'t wait to be back! Katie was a wonderful host! It was my first time using Airbnb and she provided comprehensive directions to her house in Ballard. On the first night we arrived later than anticipated, so she drove us to an excellent local restaurant for dinner. Katie\\'s home is very clean with all the amenities one could possibly need and a very welcoming cat, Lexi. Even on cloudy or rainy days, the house and room felt bright with its large windows. The house is not far from downtown Ballard, which is a very charming neighbourhood in itself! Many restaurants and cafes which stay open late available, specialty shops, and music venues. The neighbourhood felt very safe overall and all the Seattleites we met have been beyond helpful and friendly.\\r\\n I went to Seattle for a chilled out, restorative vacation and that\\'s what I got, thanks in part to Katie, who was a wonderful host. She was welcoming, easy to talk to, helpful but also respectful of personal space. Her home was a quiet, bright retreat in a neighborhood that I loved. If you\\'re looking for the perfect Seattle retreat, look no further. Thanks, Katie! The room was very confortable and cosy. She has a nice cat, and Katie was very helpfull to tell us the good spots of the city ! Perfect and quiet neightboorhood. On conseille cet endroit à tous les français qui veulent venir visiter Seattle! Katie was a wonderful hostess.  She was warm and friendly, as was Lexi, the cat.  The accommodations were perfect for my purposes and I hope to return often.  I feel I have met a new friend.   I had a wonderful stay at Katie\\'s house! visiting Seattle for work and couldn\\'t have asked for better accommodations. Katie\\'s house had all the necessary amenities of a hotel but with the comfortable feel of being home. Katie graciously shared Wi-Fi, her iron and ironing board and encouraged me to help myself to coffee and bananas. Ballard is a great place to stay with amazing restaurants, boutique stores, the beach and the locks. I\\'d highly recommend checking out Fred Meyer if you need any groceries! Amazing.  Thanks Katie and Lexi for a great stay. I can\\'t wait to get back to beautiful Seattle and stay with you again.  Katie was a fantastic host. She is so friendly and easy to talk to. My fried and I loved staying in her cute Ballard house. The room looks exactly like how it\\'s pictured which was fantastic. The bed was also super comfortable. Katie\\'s great; if I\\'m in the area, I\\'ll definitely try to stay at her place again.  Katie was an amazing host! Her accommodations were tasteful, clean and inviting, and she went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe needed a place to stay on very short notice, and she replied to our inquiry immediately, making the process as smooth as could be.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHer knowledge of the local area also made it very easy to find places to eat and things to do.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd her cat, Lexi, adopted us as honorary members of the family, making us feel right at home,  She seriously is the best cat in the world!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was our first experience renting a room-only in an air b&b while the owner was home, and Katie put us right at ease! She was outgoing, fun, gracious, generous, and very conscientious! She even offered to give us a ride to the airport when we left (which we accepted). While we didn\\'t see each other a lot during our stay, by the end of our stay we felt like we had made a new friend with Katie!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe couldn\\'t recommend Katie more highly, if you have the chance to stay here you are in for a real treat. Thanks Katie.\\r\\nLove your pretty house the colors & hard wood floors are so pleasing.  And your welcoming kitty completes the picture. \\r\\nThanks so much.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharon Our short time with Katy was comfortable and enjoyable! Katie was a very nice host, she let us book at the last minute. She also allowed and extra person to sleep on the couch. The communication with her was fast and easy. She is very courteous, and easy going. Access to downtown Seattle is really easy if you have a car, it was only a10 minutes drive.  I totally recommend her place to any one to looking for a quiet place to sleep.\\r\\nThanks a lot Katie Katie\\'s place is immaculate.  I couldnt have found a better place to stay.  Great experience.  Katie was a wonderful host! Not only does she have the cutest cat ever, but she was incredibly helpful and friendly. Her home is adorable and very clean. It\\'s also really close to lots of great restaurants. Highly recommend this spot :)  Katie was a great host - really organised and welcoming despite having a busy schedule. And the room was exactly as described and very clean and tidy. Highly recommended! My stay was very private and pleasant. The house is \\r\\nvery comfortable, very clean and quiet. The bed and pillows \\r\\nkept me snoozing. Katie was hospitable and thoughtful.I look forward to\\r\\nstaying here  again. Jeannie Katie\\'s place was great! Her place was very tidy and comfortable in a great Ballard neighborhood with close proximity to a lot of great area attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie you\\'re a great host! Thank you!\\r\\n\\r\\nHer cat is super friendly and great at welcoming visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheers! What a gem in every experience of my three day/two night vacation. I should preface that this was my first AirBnB experience that my friend and I have ever had, and the reviews for Katie/Lexi were completely accurate. Katie was firstly very concise with communication, disarming a key exchange to her guest room. She\\'s not only a native Seattlite, but is a world-travelled, gregarious, and engaging human being. Her bucolic home was perfectly positioned for an early morning run to Golden Gardens park, and was short bike-able proximity to historic Ballard (10> minutes on bicycle, 20+ minutes on foot). Adorable bathroom adjacent to the guest room a great plus. Did we mention Lexi, the internet sensation cat that also inhabits the house? Katie is lucky we didn\\'t steal her back to Portland! Adorable. Pssst, renters tip; ask to see Lexi dawn her cape.  Katie was really welcoming and easy going. I was here for work so it was a peaceful and quiet place for me to get some much needed rest. Her place is cute and very clean and the bed was super comfy. Her cat is pretty adorable too. Definitely recommended!  My stay at Katie\\'s private room in sunny Ballard was my first experience with AirBnb and I would highly recommend it. Katie was very organized, accommodating, hospitable and made me feel at home.  I was participating in a pretty intensive professional and personal development course and she was very respectful of my space and provided a happy environment for me to chill.  Ballard is a really cute neighborhood in Seattle that I hadn\\'t spent much time in and it has become my new favorite!! We stayed at Katie for 2 weeks.\\r\\nKatie is a great host. She is helpful and friendly. Made fresh coffee every morning.\\r\\nThe room was exactly as pictured- tidy and clean. The bathroom next to our room is a great plus.\\r\\nA short walk to historic Ballard- 20 min - with beautiful shops and restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to Katie, we honestly recommend \"Private room in sunny Ballard \".  Katie is a great host, very friendly and welcoming. The room was comfortable and exactly as pictured. Lexi the cat is a real charmer. I truly enjoyed staying at Katie\\'s. It met my needs an expectations perfectly. Katie made me feel at home in an enjoyable and relaxed manner. Katie\\'s home is simply lovely and the room was just perfect for my needs.  Katie is a warm hostess and provided coffee and options to cook.  This neighborhood in Ballard is truly one of the sweetest with beautiful and quiet surroundings.  I highly recommend staying with Katie! We had a really good time at Katie\\'s place. The room was nice and comfortable. Unfortunately we didn\\'t had enough time to visit the neighbourhood but Ballard seemed to be a great place, with nice coffee shops, restaurants... It\\'s easy to go downtown with the bus. Katie is really careful and helped with directions, advises. We definitely recommend this place! Katie is a very hospitable host . The home is clean and charming. The neighborhood excellent and quiet . I look forward to my next stay  as it is easy and relaxing. Jeannie  Katie was a great host- friendly and accommodating!  She left very clear directions for us, and the room was exactly as it looks in the listing.  Katie made our stay very comfortable :)  We were only in town for 1 night, so it was a quick trip, but staying at Katie\\'s allowed us quick access to the lovely Ballard.  Thanks so much! I love Ballard.  walking around Katie\\'s neighborhood is like walking in a botanical garden.  seems like Ballard people take a lot of pride in their flower gardens.  Katie was a wonderful host.  We felt very comfortable staying in her home and sharing her space.  i definitely recommend a stay at Katie\\'s home.   Katie was awesome! We really enjoyed our stay at her sweet little spot! Lexi was a doll :-) Love the neighborhood, perfect place to explore the area ! Thank you so much Katie! Hope to see you again :-)\\r\\n Katie was a fantastic host! Very kind and welcoming. The room was lovely and exactly as pictured and described. Her house is also very charming- a historic gem in Ballard!  \\r\\nMy boyfriend is a very picky (annoying!) sleeper and Katie was kind enough to provide a fan for him to use at night as a white noise machine. \\r\\nAlso her cat Lexi is a sweetie! This was my first AirBnB experience and I\\'m so glad we chose Katie\\'s place to stay!  Great for our needs, my father in law was very comfortable.  Katie was a great host.  Easy to locate; clean, comfortable and quiet. Loved the cat! We mostly just slept there as we were very busy, but I would easily return. The Ballard neighorhood is one of my favorites. Room was cozy, clean and bright. Katie is friendly, warm and helpful. Great neighborhood.\\r\\nHighly recommended. Room a bit bright from street lights so bring a sleep mask!  The accommodations and host were wonderful. Katie had great recommendations for local restaurants and attractions. Her kitty was super friendly too - crawling right up onto my lap! Katie treated the space as though it was ours, letting us watch tv on her couch, use the laundry machines, and store our food in her fridge. I would definitely stay here again. This listing was everything we expected and more. The wife and I just needed a place to rest our heads as we visited Seattle and it was a very nice stay. Katie was more than accommodating. You have plenty of privacy if that\\'s what you desire, and the neighborhood is gorgeous. Extremely clean. Katie is also very helpful with recommendations of things to do and places to eat which all turned out marvelously.Would stay here again. Thank you for a wonderful experience. Katie was an excellent host. The room was nice and clean. She also gave us some great tips about enjoying Ballard and about venturing out of Seattle.  I loved staying with Katie! Not only is her house super adorable, clean, and charming, but the guest room is lovely and her communication is excellent. She even drove me downtown to my hotel when I left her house! If you want a relaxing place to rest your head in a quiet neighborhood, definitely stay with Katie. Her house is also a few blocks from the bus stop to downtown Ballard which is full of great restaurants and bars. I will definitely stay here again next time I come to Seattle.  We had a lovely stay at Katie\\'s house in charming Ballard. She made it very easy for us to come and enjoy our day in Seattle. The room and the house are really tastefully decorated and comfortable. Her house isn\\'t so close to coffee shops and restaurants (maybe 10-15 min walk to the nearest one) but the neighborhood is very easy to navigate. Katie had lots of insight and suggestions about Seattle that was very helpful! Katie\\'s house was spotless. She was very friendly and helpful about local activities and directions. We were a little surprised that Katie did not offer breakfast. We did have coffee and were able to watch TV. Katie Logan was an absolutely wonderful host and her home and the room were charming and beautiful.  This was our first time using Airbnb, and we are so grateful to have had such a great experience.  Katie really made us feel at home and the room was very comfortable with everything that we needed.  The bathroom was very nice and we could use the kitchen to cook.  We loved the neighborhood and had a great time walking around Ballard.  It was easy to walk to the lovely downtown and Katie was extremely helpful in giving tips about the area.  I am moving to Seattle and Katie was very kind about giving me information on housing and living in Seattle.  She was so pleasant and easy to talk to and she was a very fun and gracious host.  She has the sweetest, most adorable kitty named Lexi, who made the experience even more wonderful!  It was freezing cold in Seattle and raining during our stay, and it was so lovely to come back to Katie\\'s lovely, cozy house and be greeted by a sweet, affectionate kitty who always wanted to cuddle and keep us company.  It was little things like this that made staying at Katie\\'s much more personal and welcoming than staying in a hotel.  We highly recommend Katie\\'s room in Ballard and thank her for a fantastic stay in Seattle! Kathy\\'s place was lovely!the room was clean and cozy. The neighborhood is quite but close to many fancy restaurants and pubs!\\nShe always answered quickly and very friendly!this was my first airb&b experience and I\\'m very satisfied! I would definately recommend for a stay in Seattle! Host was nice, listing was as shown, and Ballard is a really nice neighborhood. Katie\\'s place is exactly what I am looking for in a room: it was impeccably clean, in a lovely, mellow neighborhood, and with a friendly kitty to boot. Katie is friendly and accommodating. I loved staying here. Katie was a great host. Her place was lovely, very clean and in a great location. She also provides her guests with a handy guide to the neighborhood. I would definitely recommend Katie\\'s place to anyone who wants to stay in Ballard. I had a terrific stay with Katie in the Ballard area. The location is ideal for exploring the Seattle area plus taking various daytrips. Katie\\'s home was clean with a very comfortable bed and fabulous backyard area for relaxing. Katie was very knowledgeable about the area and had lots of tips on things to see and areas to visit. I enjoyed my stay and hope to stay again soon when I am in the area. We needed a place to accommodate us late (and last minute...) and Katie was the perfect host. The house is really great, there are some friendly dogs that will not bother you at all and a couple bikes that you can use. Despite the short duration of our stay (one night) we would totally recommend Katie to anyone visiting Portland. Katie was very responsive and made accessing her home easy. Lexi the cat served as the designated greeter. We never actually connected in  person but we felt we had a very positive stay at Katie\\'s. The location is nice and handy & we followed her suggestion of checking out a viewpoint that was wonderful. Katie is fantastic and the room is exactly as advertised, clean and comfortable. We stayed only one night, but put poor Katie through the paces.  First, we weren\\'t sure of our arrival time, which kept getting pushed later and later in to the evening until our final arrival was after her bedtime. She was super laid back about it and gave me easy directions for how to get in the house and find our room.  The next morning, I needed an iron/iron board and she took my call while at work and gave me access to a private part of the house so that I could iron a shirt. Finally, a couple hours after checking out, I realized that I had left my groceries in the refrigerator. Even though her schedule was tight and she had other guests who had already checked in, Katie went out of her way to put our food in a cooler and leave it out for us to pick up. The cherry on top is her fantastic cat. All in all, it was a short, but great stay for us. Thank you, Katie! Katie is a very nice and kind woman, she was a great host! her cat is very cute and nice too. We liked very much the style and decoration of the house. The bed was comfortable and the neighborhood very quiet at night. In the morning, there was more noise because of works in a close street. The only inconvenience was the fact that the shared bathroom is next to the guest room. The neighborhood is pretty, and we think that the cost of the night was cheap for what it was, compared to all we saw on internet. Katie Logan is a great host and kind woman. She give us privacy and i like that. The room is nice and clean and neighborhood is good. Katie was so friendly and welcoming. We didn\\'t see her very much as we were in town for a wedding and we were out and about for most of our stay but it was so lovely to have a clean, well kept place to stay during the night in such a pleasant location. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bedroom was well lit and was just the right size for a couple.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatie made sure to keep in contact with us throughout the stay to let us know when she would be out of the house early or coming back late. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all it was a great experience and we are very happy to have stayed. Katie was a great and friendly host! She always had a recommendation to give us about where we were going, she is very knowledgeable about things to do around Seattle! Her house is a little far from downtown Seattle, but Ballard is a way better area to explore! So fun and funky, lots of amazing restaurants and sights. And if you want to get downtown, the bus stop is only 2 blocks away with one bus (the number 40) that goes right to Pike Place. Make sure you like cats if you stay - Lexie is a super friendly and cuddly kitty! Katie is a very welcoming host and very helpful.  She offered her air mattress pump as we did not have one and was very accommodating in allowing my daughter to sleep on the air mattress on the floor.  Even though the bathroom is shared and next to the guest room we heard little noise.  Her house is very light and bright and was a very pleasant place to stay. Awesome place. Katie did a great job collecting materials on Seattle and Ballard so it was easy to find places to go. The place is a bit of a walk to downtown Ballard, but it\\'s near a bus stop that goes to both downtown Seattle and downtown Ballard so it was not a problem at all. The room was nice, the bed was comfy, and the cat was a great ambassador for the house. Katie was an excellent host. Very prepared and friendly! Would definitely stay there again! Katie was great! She has a great home in a great neighbourhood, I would definitely stay here again! My partner and I enjoyed our stay at Katie\\'s house in Ballard! Katie is very friendly and flexible on our arrival time to get keys to the house. The room is simple and clean with easy access to the shared bathroom. It was just a 15 min walk to the main strips in Ballard, and the neighborhood was cute and homey. We also really enjoyed cuddling with Katie\\'s super friendly cat Lexi! It was also very convenient to use the laundry in the house. The reservation was canceled 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. The reservation was canceled 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Katie\\'s father passed away on the first night of my arrival so her unavailability was understandable. She still made the effort to talk with me from time to time to make sure everything was ok. I didn\\'t feel lonely though as her cat Lexi kept me very well-accompanied. I like very much that the house was quiet most of the time. Katie was upfront with the problem of ants in her kitchen and took active steps to fix it. The bed was very comfortable. The room was clean and well-kept. I would stay there again. Absolutely delightful! Charming, sophisticated vintage home. High quality bedding, towels. Perfectly clean and organized home. Bedroom just feet away from shared bath-owner made us feel that it was our own bath, did not feel uncomfortable about the shared  (email hidden)eat location to see old town Ballard. Exceeded expectations! Excellent! Cozy, stupendously clean and wonderfully quiet in a lovely neighborhood. Best. Bathroom. Mirror. EVER. Katie was even friendlier than her cat, and volunteered to give me a ride to a nearby car rental. Wonderful, comfortable spot in Ballard.  We had a quick stay and didn\\'t see Katie, but her directions were easy to follow and we felt right at home.  (And her cat is adorable.) Katie\\'s place was great! A very cute home that was close to downtown Ballard, with a super sweet cat to boot! Katie was super friendly, funny, and accommodating. Thanks for having us! Katie called me before arrival to make sure I properly knew how to get into the house, which was very sweet of her. The house was lovely in a very cute neighborhood that was relatively accessible by bus, and the cat was also adorable. \\r\\nThe shower was really nice and the room was perfectly pleasant.\\r\\nShe was very friendly and even drove us to the car rental place in the morning, which was a huge help for us. \\r\\nOverall it was a really nice stay.  Katie was an amazing host.  She has a beautiful home in a great neighborhood that is within walking distance to restaurants / coffee shops / etc.  She is from Seattle and was able to provide lots of great recommendations on where to go / what to see / etc.  The bedroom is nice and comfortable.  The bathroom is clean and has a great shower.  Free parking is provided.  She has great wifi and cable.\\r\\n\\r\\nA highlight of our stay was getting to know her cat, Lexi! Pleasant, Quiet and clean. Katie is a fine host and her accommodation just perfect for my needs.  Katie and the cat are such great hosts that we feel like home right away as we get there. Katie\\'s so sweet that she provided us with fresh towels and delicious chocolate treats and snacks. It was also nice to have scented candles in our bedroom. She also gave us orca cards that we can refill for public transportation. We had such a great Christmas getaway thanks to Kaite.    My husband and I needed last minute accommodations in Seattle, and Katie came to the rescue. Clean and comfortable bed n shared bathroom. Thanks to Katie for making us feel at home. Was a bit chilly at night, but she clarified that the heater was acting funny. I fell in love with Lexie, the cat. Very well behaved, beautiful n adorable. Katie was a fabulous and very welcoming host.  She lives in a very nice, safe, and quiet neighborhood that is a quick walk to Sunset Hill Park which is a great place watch the sunset over Puget Sound.  Her house is very clean, fresh and gets a lot of sunlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bedroom has a good mirror and closet, an extremely comfortable bed with a down comforter and plenty of good lighting.  The bathroom is also very clean and the shower/tub is very spacious. It also has a great mirror that bends to allow you to check your hair/makeup from any angle (even the back of your head!). \\r\\n\\r\\nKatie was kind enough to clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom as she knew I would be staying for over a week.  She also provided a few snacks, soaps, shampoo/conditioners, and water bottles in the bedroom. \\r\\n\\r\\nI arrived in Seattle when Katie was out of the house and she gave me clear directions over the phone for how to get into the house.  She was always available via text if I had any questions.   When I had to extend my stay in Ballard for a few days, I was very appreciative when Katie immediately approved my request.  I was also delighted by the tips she gave me about Seattle\\'s grunge scene and the names of shops where some of the musicians are known to hang out. \\r\\n\\r\\n Her kitty Lexi was a very delightful and talkative companion!  The house and host were amazing and I would stay there again!       My stay at Katie\\'s place was fantastic! She was very accommodating when I booked very last minute. I enjoyed being in the heart of Ballard, close to the bus stop and only a short walk to downtown Ballard. Katie always had coffee ready for me in the morning. There were always clean towels, bed sheets and even a basket of shampoo/conditioner and other essentials in a basket in the room. I also loved her cat Lexi, such an incredibly sweet kitty! Would absolutely stay again.  She was very straightforward and respectful of my privacy. She even gave me a car ride the next morning to my next destination. Katie is a class act. Host Katie is welcoming and accommodating...her house is super clean and well located to everything.  Down comforter is a pleasure to sleep under.  Overall Katie\\'s hospitality offers value for money.  Thanks, Katie! We didn\\'t get to meet Katie, but she was kind enough to leave thoughtful notes and always quick to respond, often just ahead of our needs. She provided thoughtful recommendations and clear instructions. We left on foot and had a great full day out and about. Pristine lil neighborhood full of aromatic flowering trees with plenty of fun things to do at the bottom of the hill. Thanks, we enjoyed it! Our stay with Katie was wonderful, from beginning to end. Communication was easy, clear and comfortable. The room (and home) was clean and well-cared for and we loved the location. We stayed for two nights and had a great night\\'s sleep both nights in Katie\\'s quiet guest room. We can\\'t wait to come back!  Good We had a lovely time, never met Katie. But she allowed us to arrive late & sleep in. It was a wonderful little room & I loved the bathroom!! Thank you for having us.  The house and the room are pretty nice, comfortable, clean and very quiet. Katie is really nice and friendly. Ballard is one of the best location where to live in Seattle, so I strongly recommend this place! We had a great experience here. Just in town for one night and in need of a peaceful, comfortable, safe place to sleep after a long night on the road. This was perfect and affordable. Nice quiet neighborhood, but close to breakfast spots in the morning. Downtown was a short, easy way up the road. Place is cozy. Very much like crashing at a friend\\'s house. A clean, tidy, nice friend. :)\\r\\nDefinitely recommend it. Oh! And we forgot some pajama pants in our rush to get out the door. Katie was very sweet in contacting us quickly and arranging to leave them outside for us to pick up on our way out of town. Thank you, Katie! Katie contacted us right away and gave us good instructions on her place.  She made us feel welcome and had a clean home. \\r\\nThe neighborhood was very nice and within walking distance to many stores.  Nice room in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of parking.  The house is close to bus lines and close to a variety of shops and restaurants. Katie was a good host and went out of her way to accommodate my stay.  The room was just as advertised, clean, quite and pleasant! We had a lovely overnight stay at Katie\\'s.  The home is very comfortable, clean and we felt welcome. The historic neighborhood is cute and quiet. Location is convenient for a leisurely walk or short drive into the heart of Ballard. \\r\\n\\r\\nCommunication at booking and before arrival was professional and prompt.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, Katie Katie was welcoming and helpful. This lovely character home was a great home base during the Puget Sound LYS tour for both my friend and I. This place is perfect if you\\'re looking for a cute place to stay in a quiet neighbourhood.  The room was clean and Katie provided everything we needed. However, if you are sharing the bed, just a heads up that it is on wheels and somewhat difficult to sleep on with two people (the whole bed moves when one person flips over). Ballad was beautiful and it was a safe neighborhood with plenty of parking.  We were very comfortable in the room at Katie\\'s house. We appreciated the clear expectations sheet and enjoyed our talks with her. Katie\\'s house was really friendly and cosy. We arrived a bit late in the evening. Even though she wasn\\'t home, she was very thoughtful and guided us how to enter the house. There was no body home, as katie was busy at work,thats why we were a bit scared (only because we were totally new to the place, nothing serious), otherwise the location is very good, its quite and peaceful.Also, we got a sound sleep on our room. We met katie in the early morning, and she was very helpful and provided us with bunch of informations regarding shopping and sightseeing. Close and convenient location and great parking. I felt safe. Katie is a lovely lady who appreciates privacy and was friendly and warm. Additionally, we both have a penchant for coasters, so that made me feel at home!  Katie hat ein süsses Haus in einer ruigen und sicheren Gegend in Seattle. Das Haus ist sauber, der garten erholsahm und egal was du brauchst, Katie wird dir helfen. Super Gastgeberin, total unkompliziert und empfehlenswert..! Danke für alles Katie..!  I appreciated Katie\\'s open & warm hospitality.  I felt a comfortable ease in her home.   She made space in her refrigerator for my food, offered the use of her kitchen, as well as her blender for my early morning \"green\" smoothie. And early it was!  I initially communicated with her about needing to do vocal warm-ups around 6 a.m.  (and using a blender at around 7) to prepare  for a morning performance at 9:30.   Her flexibility was also appreciated.  And I liked that we communicated by phone and e-mail beforehand; she gave me clear instructions for how to get into her home if she wasn\\'t there.  All in all, it was a relaxing, positive experience, and a lovely connection made. Katie was a wonderful and accommodating hostess. My mother and I thought her Ballard home was a perfect and cozy place to spend our couple of nights in town.  Katie was a an amazing host. It was Dad\\'s first trip to the US and she showcased amazing Seattle Hospitality. Everything in the room was mint clean with clear instructions to make oneself comfortable. The look of the room is exactly as shown on the Airbnb profile page. I highly recommend booking Katie home if Seattle is your Destination for a short stay.  Checking in was very convenient since we arrived late at night. Both my boyfriend and I are fairly new to the air bnb experience and we both enjoyed it very much. Katie provided helpful tips about the area and she was very hospitable. We got along with Katie very easily, she\\'s a very friendly and welcoming individual. We both felt that we were provided with a decent amount of privacy and interaction from our hostess. Thank you, Katie! I had a quick overnight stay at Katie\\'s. Everything was clean and instructions were written out. I arrived while she was out but there were clear instructions to get in the house.  The house of Katie is really nice. The room is comfortable and clean.The bathroom is just next to the room. The house is in Ballards which is a quiet neighborhood and few blocks further, there are microbreweries and restaurants. We had a great communication with Katie as we were a bit later in the house than we thought. Katie is a sweet and very helpful host. Thank you Katie. Katie made me feel very welcome and the room was spacious and comfortable. This is a wonderful neighborhood; one of my favorite in Seattle. Booking with her was quick and easy and she clearly explained how to get in since she was out when I arrived. Everything was neat and clean. Thank you Katie!!! We had a lovely stay in Katie\\'s beautiful spare room. She was warm and welcoming and gave us great recommendations for what to do in the area. Perfect spot for a short stay in a fun and exciting neighborhood! Katie was a great host who gave us a wonderful clean room. The entire house was well kept and homely which gave my girlfriend and I a much needed bout of relaxation on our road trip across the country. We only stayed for one night, but I would recommend a stay at Katie\\'s place for a clean laid back atmosphere. Lovely area close to our daughter\\'s chosen university (Seattle Pacific).  Did not ever see host in person, but she made us feel welcome and made sure our accommodations were easy to access and instructions were clear and simple.  MANY eateries (coffee shops, bakeries, fast, store front...) within one mile.  Great experience in a clean, secure/safe and easy to access home. We had a very good time at Katie\\'s room. She was very open to let us use her kitchen for morning breakfast / evening tea. We really appreciate her for making our first airbnb experience awesome.Being a local she was very helpful in guiding us about the city and things to do. She has a nice backyard where you can relax and have cup of coffee. Her setup was very well maintained and tidy. We really thank her for such a wonderful experience.  \\n\\nWe would highly recommend her room to any future travellers. I really enjoyed my time at Katie\\'s home.  The accommodations were just as advertised and felt warm and welcoming.  Katie is a great host who knows a lot about the area and is very helpful in directions and guidance - great place to stay! Great experience!  Being a first time airbnb user Katie did a great job making me feel at home and comfortable.  The room was clean and comfortable and sharing the bathroom was never inconvenient.  It was really easy to talk to Katie if I had questions and she also had great advice about getting around in Seattle.  And Katie was an incredible life-saver when I realized I needed iron a dress for a wedding.  I choose the neighborhood because I really like Ballard, but the experience was made much better by my lovely stay at this airbnb. Katie was a great host and very accommodating to my late arrival.  The room was just as described, sunny and tidy!  She provided some recommendations to the surrounding area and helped make my first trip to Seattle very enjoyable :) Katie was a fabulous host! She was warm and welcoming. My sunny private room, was just that. It afforded me a lovely clean and comfortable sanctuary for the week I spent in Ballard.  Katie is a geniunely kind and compassionate person. She was very helpful with suggestions for places to eat, to visit and simplifying transportation. \\nBallard is a great neighborhood, most restaurants and some cool shopping are no more than a 15-20 minute walk through this lovely residential neighborhood.\\nThey even had an ice cream truck!\\nI will definitely consider staying with Katie in the future and highly recommend this lovely spot. This was a lovely home in a charming neighborhood. Very nice. Katie was a gracious and welcoming host. Remained in close communication with us even as our arrival plans kept changing. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe only had one full day in Seattle, and she had a great guide to the neighborhood printed for us in the room. Ballard ended up being our favorite neighborhood! Katie was willing to allow me to drop my luggage and get the key early because of my transportation issues.  Thanks for being flexible, Katie.  The house met our needs very well. We needed a clean, quiet and convenient spot for a quick one-night stay in Ballard and Katie\\'s place filled the bill. Nothing fancy, but Katie is a welcoming host and, though we didn\\'t see much of her, very pleasant and helpful.  Katie was a very hospitable host. Her communication prior to our trip was helpful and very welcoming. Upon arrival she was again welcoming. The room we stayed in was as described - clean and comfortable. The bed was amazing.  We enjoyed sharing coffee and conversation with her before we set off in the morning. The location was perfect for us. We would recommend a stay with Katie for anyone visiting Seattle.  Katie was amazing! I ended up out and about more than I thought, and ended up having to make emergency travel plans and leave early. However, Katie was very accommodating and understanding. She even offered to leave a way to get in if I missed my flight. Couldn\\'t have asked for a better first Airbnb host. \\r\\n\\r\\nKatie\\'s home was warm, inviting, and very clean.  Katie was a great host and I really enjoyed staying here. The room is exactly as described. Katie was helpful with recommendations on where to eat and was also very easy to get along with.

It was great to get the chance to hear her insights about Seattle and we benefited from her recommendations.

Katie made was very welcoming and we felt very comfortable in her home. The room was lovely as was the entire house. You can tell Katie takes pride in her home. We were visiting a friend who lives in Ballard so the location was perfect! She provided a list of Ballard sites along with restaurant recommendations. She directed us to a pancake house for a delicious hearty breakfast that got us through the day so we could enjoy walking around Ballard.  We had a wonderful stay in Katie\\'s Ballard home. She left a key for us, enabling flexible check in time. Katie also provided detailed recommendations for various neighborhoods in the area, which led us to several great meals and shopping destinations. Her home was warm, clean, and inviting.

Katie was friendly, accommodating, and a great host.  Would absolutely stay here again if I were to visit Seattle. Katie was very welcoming as a host. She communicated early to make sure we were set for our arrival. She provided advice on a great nearby park/beach. The room and common area were clean and cozy. The neighborhood was safe and convenient. I had a car so the street parking was a huge bonus (lots of open spaces for parking). If I\\'m in Seattle again, I would definitely come back to Katie\\'s and recommend it! Thanks, Katie!   Overall good experience. Quiet, safe neighborhood. Room clean. Nice host. No frills. \\nHowever, no extra touches. I tend to feel more comfortable and enjoy my stay when a home is more welcoming...like fresh flowers in a vase, full Kleenex box, fresh hot coffee, etc.  A very clean and organized room in an excellent neighborhood. Great amenities and very nice Host. Highly Recommend. Great to meet Katie! Very lovely home and comfortable stay in Ballard. \\r\\nThank you! Katie has a really nice place--cute neighborhood, sweet little room, new bathroom and very well maintained. Katie is a darling--super friendly, smart, charming and helpful. I\\'d absolute stay with her again.  I and my sister had a nice stay at Katie\\'s place. The bed size was enough for both of us. We really liked the neighborhood -calm and peaceful. Although we couldn\\'t see her when we get there, she communicated us several times before our arriving and it was very smooth. The tips about the rules she wrote down were very neat and useful. Thank you, Katie! Great neighborhood, quiet and clean. Katie is a great host. The added bonus for me is the coffee. She is easy to chat with and gives you your own space. I will use her again.  This is the second time I stayed with Katie and I really enjoyed it. She\\'s very kind and welcoming.  Meeting Katie was an absolute joy and staying at her home in Ballard was wonderful. She is incredibly friendly, kind, and accommodating. She went out of her way more than once to help us out. Her house is very nice, clean, quiet, and cozy. We felt right at home and we would absolutely recommend her to anybody visiting Seattle. Katie made me feel very welcome, I was able to get the key easily and let myself in. The neighborhood is beautiful and my\\r\\nRoom was perfect! It was exactly what I was looking for.  Would absolutely book again!  My flight got in late, so I didn\\'t even meet Katie when I arrived and she\\'d left before I got up, but I still had a lovely stay. The location was perfect for my needs, the house was charming, and the room was very clean and comfortable. Thanks, Katie! We spent just 1 night at Katie\\'s but it was a nice visit. She was very prompt in getting back to us, even though it was very last minute. The house was clean and the neighborhood was nice. We were pretty close to the downtown Ballard area, which has many cool shops and restaurants.  Det er anden gang vi bor hos Katie. Katie er en dejlig, imødekommende vært. Hun er hjælpsomog hensynsfuld, frisk morgenkaffe hver dag. Værelset er meget rent og pænt, rene håndklæder efter behov.\\r\\nMan deler badeværelse og køkken. Dette fungerer fint.\\r\\nKaties hus ligger et dejligt roligt sted i Ballard. Man kan gå til Ballard med mange gode spisesteder, der er The Locks og en park med en smuk udsigt, alt i gåafstand. Der er god plads til at parkere foran huset.\\r\\nKan helt klart anbefales. Katie greeted me like I already knew her and made me feel right at home. The room was clean and comfortable and everything was so easy I didn\\'t have to worry about anything. I will stay here again next time I visit Seattle! I loved staying with Katie! My partner and I couldn\\'t make it in until the evening, and she was very accommodating about it. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very clean. Katie was friendly but also gave my partner and I tons of space and privacy. I would definitely stay with Katie again. I was in Seattle for a weekend workshop and was very happy staying at Katie\\'s for the night. Her home is easy to find, in a great location surrounded by the adorable Ballard neighborhood. I would definitely go back next time i\\'m in Seattle! Katie was wonderful! She was able to accommodate me last minute. The house is beautiful and in a great area. I would happily return! Katie was very helpful, kind and respectful. I feel very comfortable in her sweet home.  Everything about my stay at Katie\\'s was exactly as she had described it would be.  And isn\\'t that what we desire from an Airbnb experience?  That bed is very comfy indeed.  Hope I can return before too long. Great and comfortable place to stay, in a cool, safe feeling neighborhood. Katie was a very accommodating host. I had a great stay with Katie; I arrived late at night from a delayed flight and she was so accommodating! It was such a convenient place to stay for a couple nights for a work trip, in a great neighborhood. I was very comfortable there. Thanks, Katie! Katie was a very awesome and lovely host. My girlfriend and I were pleased to chat with her and pick her brain for great sights and restaurants in the area.  Our stay with Katie was wonderful.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had to make a trip to the emergency room during our stay, Katie drove my wife to the hospital to be with me. That was only one of her extra caring supports. We really appreciate her thoughtful support for us as her guests. The neighborhood was fine. Parking was ample. The directions on getting the key was easy.And our host, Katie, left a note for us. The listing was exactly as described. The house is cozy and the bed is very comfortable.  The neighborhood is residential--very quiet and safe. Katie was personable and warm, and I felt very welcome in her home. She had coffee in the maker and ready to go every morning! She had water and toiletries and granola bars in the room for me. The house is nice and kitchen has everything we need. I would definitely recommend to other guests. House was very clean and nice. Exactly what we were looking for for the night! Thanks Katie! Brian\\'s suite is great! Perfect location in Ballard, just a short walk to the main drag full of restuarants, shops and bars. We didn\\'t get to meet Brian as he was away, but Bo showed us in and gave us a helpful list of suggestions for the area. The suite is spacious, comfy and well put together. Felt like a home away from home! Great place. Very clean, spacious, and comfortable, with many thoughtful touches. Brian was very considerate and easy to communicate with. Sensitive sleepers might find the furnace a bit loud, but earplugs helped a lot. Would definitely consider staying here again. Brian was considerate and communicative prior to our stay, and left no unanswered questions regarding the property and our stay. The room we stayed in was cozy, comfortable, and spacious. We were also pleased that Brian was willing to accommodate the short length of our stay (just one night), which was an issue with other hosts. What an awesome space! The bed was super comfy, and the kitchenette was more than sufficient. Brian was easy-going and flexible with our uncertain schedule, and was able to let us add an extra night at the last minute. LOVE the fact that he allows folks to stay for just one night. We will definitely consider returning next time we\\'re in the area! Brian was easy to communicate with, and very helpful with any requests or questions I had. I love Ballard and for those who always breeze past it on the way too or from Seattle\\'s downtown core, I highly recommend stopping to check it out. Brian\\'s place is within walking distance of downtown Ballard and all it\\'s awesome boutiques, restaurants, and bars and his basement suite is roomy, with a really comfy bed, and a great wall of boardgames for those so inclined. Would definately stay there again.  Brian is an excellent host and his apartment is wonderful!  We spent a night here in Feb 2014.  The apartment is huge, the bed is comfy, and Brian thoughtfully has a coffee maker, microwave, and mini-fridge.  The location in Ballard is a \"10\".  My wife walked to our dinner reservation on Ballard Blvd., less than a mile away.  We plan on staying with Brian every time we go up to Seattle from Portland! This was a very nice experience.  The finished basement was a good size, very clean, good amenities. It was quiet, in a nice neighborhood.  Brian was an excellent host. I highly recommend to others and would gladly stay there again. The basement was very nicely finished and comfortable. We had a separate entrance and it felt very private which was nice. We enjoyed a movie on the projector and appreciated the toys available for our toddler. My only problem was with the bed which was soft for my taste. \\r\\n\\r\\nBallard was a great place to stay. It was about 20 minutes from downtown and had some good breweries and restaurants. We would like to stay here again.  Brian\\'s place was absolutely fantastic! The room was very comfortable and easily had space to sleep four adults. This was my first trip to Seattle and I had no problem locating Brian\\'s place or getting around. The neighborhood is friendly and fun, and the house is located only a short drive from the locks or Gasworks park. I highly recommend staying here if you\\'re visiting Seattle!  This was our first AirBnB experience and Brian set the bar extremely high. He curated a very comfortable, thoughtful, and all around pleasant experience for our 3 night stay. The basement was clean, comfortable, spacious, and quiet. The location was perfect and within walking distance of downtown Ballard or a block away from the bus stop. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend a stay here to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Ballard. I stayed at Brian\\'s place with two friends after we did a walking tour of Ballard\\'s microbreweries.  His basement apartment was perfect for what we were looking for.  Brian was out of town so we never actually met, but he left excellent instructions about the place and a ton of information about things to do and places to see all around Ballard and Seattle. His basement apartment was very clean and in a great, quiet neighborhood. I will likely stay here again on my next trip to the Seattle/Ballard area. Highly recommended. Great spot! Took a lovely stroll down to Ballard for dinner and had great accommodations for the night. Brian was so flexible with our late arrival and we even became friends with the cat! Thanks again! Brian\\'s place was clean and comfortable.  I had everything I needed for my night in Seattle. \\r\\nAnother good experience.  A nice, clean, comfortable, quiet space.  I hope to stay there again.  Lovely neighborhood!  Excellent host! Brian was very informative and helpful; he gave us good guidance to make our way through the neighborhood with advice on where to eat and get supplies. Brian was friendly and easy to communicate with, and the place was simply furnished and exactly as pictured. Great neighborhood, great overall experience! I certainly recommend. First AirBnB experience! Brian was really easy to communicate with prior to the trip and answered all my questions regarding ammenities, location, public transit, neighborhood - your typical stuff. He also offers a great deal of visitor materials for your trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nROOM: This is a basement unit, but you enter through the back of the house and only share the mud room with the rest of the house. It is essentially your own entrance, so if you want to stay low-key you can - plus Brian didn\\'t seem to be home much during our four day stay. The room is massive and true to the description provided. \\r\\n\\r\\nLOCATION: A beautiful residential area! I\\'m grateful we rented a car because although there are bus lines nearby, it could take up to an hour to get to somewhere of interest for us - Fremont being much closer. And the Ballard district is just over a mile. Parking was easy, we did so in front of the house just as Brian promised. Parking was also relatively easy everywhere else we went.\\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER: There is no lock on the door that connects the mud room to the basement. I was traveling with a friend, so this didn\\'t bother me. If I were alone, it may be a different story. You can hear people\\'s footsteps from the main house. It was loud and at times we could hear indistinct talking, which was not such a big deal. We would get in late at night and heard most of it only during the early mornings. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely stay again. Thanks for a great stay! My family had a great stay at Brian\\'s place. It was our first airbnb experience and we weren\\'t disappointed. Great location (15 minutes to everywhere we wanted to go: Mariners game, Pike Place Market & ferris wheel, ferries) - seemed safe and lots of great shops and eateries nearby. Brian\\'s basement was a great space for our family (mom, dad, and 5 & 7 year olds) -  lots of space for them to move, lots of (much appreciated - thanks!) toys and family movies to watch with the projector. Brian was a pretty much invisible host (I never saw him and hubby bumped into him once) but super easy to stay in touch with and quick to reply to texts asking for advice on where to eat, park, anything really. Also really appreciated the use of his back yard so kids could run around and we could enjoy a relaxing drink. Thanks for the great introduction to Seattle and airbnb, Brian! Brian is a great host.  He was quick to respond to my messages, and provided great suggestions for places to go and things to do in the area. The basement space was perfect for our one night stay in Ballard. Highly recommended. Brian\\'s basement apartment was great! The keypad lock system was great especially for us since we checked in later in the evening. The apartment was spacious and clean. The bathroom was stocked with clean towels and basic necessities like shampoo and soap. The projector was AWESOME for watching movies and hanging out on the couch. the space was everything we needed. We were able to come and go very easily. We would on occasion hear footsteps upstairs, but nothing bothersome. We would stay here again. The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting. The neighborhood was great to walk around and there was plenty to see along with great restaurants and shops to explore. We also took the bus downtown which was easy. The space was clean and as expected; plenty of room for two of us. After a day out and about it was very comfortable to spend time relaxing at the house. The bed was comfortable and we felt at home. Nice to see a cat around and overall a wonderful experience. \\r\\n Brian\\'s place was exactly what I needed. Convenient, quiet and comfortable. I took full advantage of the DVD projector, nice! He notified me in advance of a broken appliance and offered several solutions to accommodate my needs until repair was possible. Very gracious and much appreciated. Overall a perfect stay. Great location,  beautiful garden, and bunnies! He was very good at communicating. This was our first AirBnB experience and Brian\\'s basement set the standards bar high! This apartment was perfect for our family of four. The area was spacious, cozy, and very convenient for using the bus system. Our boys especially enjoyed the toys and DVD projector. Beautiful neighborhood and an enjoyable walk to the Ballard locks. We were 110% satisfied with the accommodations and the host. Brian was very easy to communicate with prior to and during our stay. Thank you!! Lovely house, private basement flat with comfy bed! Brian very hospitable - helpful instructions on the local area (which is very nice). Great host and a great stay!  Brian was a great host. I appreciated his respect for our privacy. The space is cozy. It\\'s located at a great location.  Brian was away when we arrived but he provided us with very detailed instructions of how to get into the house and how to get settled with a list of  popular places, where to eat, and transportation methods. The privacy we had was exceptional. We loved his cat, Le Tigre, who minded his own business just as we did. The basement itself was very impressive, a lot of the amenities provided were extremely thoughtful and we thought the place was very clean as well. The place looked pretty much the same as the photos and the neighbourhood was quiet and reserved. It was a very good location in terms of local shops as well as the drive down to downtown Seattle and the airport was not bad at all. It\\'s definitely a solid choice in terms of privacy and comfort. I had an amazing time while visiting. Brian was away but made sure I was well informed of everything before arriving. The place is lovely, spacious and very clean. His notes and little welcome packet was helpful and definitely made things easier. Ballard is a great town! I would highly recommend staying here.  This was a really comfy and big space near downtown Ballard.  We explored a lot just walking around.  We suggest the locks for sure.  The basement had a lot more than expected - lots of kitchen items, projector, toiletries and one of the best beds I\\'ve slept on.  So comfortable.  We hung out in the backyard both nights and had a few drinks (enjoyed the rabbits and cat - was missing our dogs back home).  Very quiet side street.  Would definitely stay here again.  Our first airbnb experience was great! Brian and his girlfriend were wonderful hosts! They said hi when we crossed each others paths but also respected our privacy. They provided us with a handy write up about the neighborhood, restaurants and brewery\\'s to check out. The basement was very clean and all ready for us when we arrived on Friday afternoon. The description is very accurate. The basement was spacious, cool and dark (perfect for sleeping in). They have a fantastic selection of movies and games. The projector screen was really fun! The couch, bed and areo bed we all very comfortable. Brain provided sheets, pillows and blankets for the bed and areo bed that were super cozy. Brian provided clean towels and the shower has an awesome shampoo/conditioner/body wash caddy! The little kitchen area was very handy. We loved the neighborhood. There are so many rad restaurants and  shops within walking distance. I would highly recommend staying here and if I am back in Seattle I will stay here again! A cute bonus are the rabbits outback and the adorable kitty cat :)  Brian has a great spot which is large and as advertised. My friend and I felt quite comfortable there and would definitely stay again. Brian responded to questions promptly.  What a wonderful experience in Ballard! The place was great and so spacious, really close to the shops and restaurants in Ballard. Highly recommended! We loved Brian\\'s place in Ballard! Very comfortable & quiet accommodations in a great neighborhood. Brian\\'s thoughtful and thorough recommendations for everything Ballard and beyond had to offer helped us get the most out of our stay, and he was a very agreeable, easy-going host! We became good friends with the bunnies on the back deck and found it hard to say goodbye. We\\'d for sure stay again! This was our first Airbnb experience and the stay at Brian\\'s place has definitely helped reinforce the use of Airbnb for our future trips. Brian communicated with us in a timely manner and provided all the necessary information needed for our stay prior to our arrival. The place is exactly how it has been described in the listing. It is cozy, clean, spacious and well lit with lots of natural light, giving no indication that this is a basement room. The beds (including the aerobed) were quite comfortable. Its also kid friendly with variety of toys and movie selection to keep the kids entertained. The location (in Ballard) is easily accessible via public means to and from downtown Seattle and it is located in a quiet neighborhood. The vicinity to Ballard locks is also a plus. I definitely recommend this place if you are considering staying in Ballard while visiting Seattle. Great first stay in an AirBnB room. Everything was exactly as described by Brian--private, clean, comfortable, quiet.  A nice air mattress was set up for me, the third person.  We especially enjoyed watching a movie on the large screen, with the very comfortable couches. My brother in law used the free weights the next morn, which was nice. If you are taller than about 5\\'10\", note that the ceiling is low in a few places--my bro-in-law had to duck as he passed under the air ducts. Wifi was fast and convenient.  And of course, Ballard is a great location.  It was a 5 minute drive to the restaurant area, and the next morning it was a straight shot to downtown on 15th Ave.  A great stay overall, and a good price.  Brian was a great host. The place was ready for us upon arrival and was very comfortable. He even set up an airbed for us. The sheets and towels were soft and fresh and he left a detailed list with helpful information about the house and the neighborhood, including recommended dining options. Overall a great experience and I would definitely stay again!  We really loved our stay at Brian\\'s. The space was very comfortable and had everything to fit our needs for the night. It was very conveniently located for ease of access to different neighborhoods in Seattle. Definitely would stay again. When we arrived, my husband was impressed with my skills at finding us such a great place. It was exactly as listed. We weren\\'t in Seattle for long, but this was an ideal place to stay. The location was great - easy to get to public transportation or you could walk if you feel like a longer stroll. The finished basement was clean, comfortable, and inviting. Thank you, Brian! If you are planning to stay longer than we did, there was lots of Seattle-specific travel literature provided.  Very good with communication via text. Answered all of our questions throughout our stay. Very accommodating to our needs. Clean and spacious private basement 5 minute drive to downtown ballard. Would stay here again.  We didn\\'t get a chance to meet Brian, but his cat LeTigre was there to meet us and send us on our way for trips out. The neighborhood was quite nice and close to a few shops. We mostly hung out with some friends on the other side of town so we didn\\'t spend a lot of time or around the house. I  personally enjoyed the projector and comfy couch the most.  We had a great weekend at Brians home in Ballard! Although we never got to meet Brian, he still served to be an excellent host. The house instructions were simple and straightforward and he provided us with everything we needed for the weekend stay. There was also a super awesome collection of strategy board games in there (i went geek mode). The location was convenient and was close to everything my gf and I wanted to see in Ballard and the surrounding area. Overall, an excellent stay at Brians! Brian was great at getting me the information I needed before arriving. Although he wasn\\'t available immediately upon my arrival, he greeted us and offered tips for the neighborhood once we\\'d crossed paths. The space was clean and spacious just like in the pictures. The description matched perfectly. The neighborhood was also beautiful and not far from Ballard hotspots.  Very nice and cozy place to stay. Comfy bed and good shower. Exactly as described. Would recommend! What a wonderful home!  Brian was a great host. He was very quick to respond and provided great instructions for getting to, and entering the home. The basement is completely separate from the rest of the home; it\\'s like a wee flat with all the necessities. There is a wonderful kitchenette, with all the provisions you\\'d find in a kitchen. Brian thoughtfully put out extra bedding for my son and niece, 14 and 15 respectively. The basement was extremely clean and looked exactly like the posting. There were so many things to entertain: projector movies, a fantastic selection of music, and an array of board games. My son, who is a history buff,  said we were meant to stay there, as there were a great selection of WWII board games and movies. The home is in a great neighborhood and very close to downtown. We went to the UW football game Saturday night, and the Seahawks game on Sunday. Perfect location. Brian cheerfully greeted us in the morning, and my kids walked out saying how much they loved their stay and how cool Brian seemed. That speaks volumes...they are both teenagers. We will definitely book there again and highly recommend it to others. Thanks, Brian!  Cheers, Alexandra, Cole, and Courtney The space was very nice. Clean and cozy.  My parents, my husband and I stayed here and it was a perfect place for us to stay.   Brian made it really easy to come and go at odd hours without bugging him, which was what we needed as we were spending most (late) evenings over at my brother\\'s house, which was within walking distance.  The kitchenette was pretty minimal and if you actually need to do cooking you will need to inquire about using the larger kitchen.   Brian was a very clear communicator. Our stay was just perfect.  Brian provided us everything we needed and was available by text if we had any questions.  The space was very comfortable and convenient.  We had a great weekend.  Thanks very much! Brian\\'s place was exactly as described. Easy check in and in a great neighborhood. There is a ton of floor space and although we were only there a night, I think it would be great for a longer stay. Brian left great information about the area, which helped us get familiar with the neighborhood. His charming cat was a wonderful greeter, too.  Super easy and well set up! We had a great time in the Ballard neighborhood. Loved the coffee set up and the outdoor space.  We had such a great experience staying at Brian\\'s. The place was bigger than expected, clean, and very nice. The shower was awesome. Would love to stay here again! Great location with plenty of living space and privacy. Clean and organized. Brian was very helpful and friendly. The space was spacious and comfortable in an excellent location. Thanks again Brian! Thank for everything! Brian\\'s space was clean and comfortable. The bed and air mattress were both better than some hotel beds I\\'ve slept on before. The location is great; you can walk to downtown Ballard or catch a bus anywhere else in the city from the front yard, essentially. Brian was very friendly and accommodating, and even offered us a ride back to the airport. All that said, I\\'d stay at Brian\\'s again just for the terrific shower.  I really loved the neighborhood, and the rabbits and cat were a cute touch! Brian was very friendly when we came, but we didn\\'t see each other after the first day. The basement had a really nice setup, and it was super convenient to have two beds (one ended up being comfortable for me, while the other was best for my girlfriend). One thing to note is it has low ceilings! I\\'m 5\\'7\" and I very easily touched the ceiling. An issue I had was that there was a little less privacy than I would have liked-- the key to the basement was jammed into the lock, which made the door difficult to fully close, so we found the door open on a few occasions when we arrived or woke up. The bathroom window didn\\'t have a covering, so although the window wasn\\'t facing anything besides the back yard, it still felt weird to not have the option to have full privacy in the bathroom. There was also a vent in the basement that was really loud, so whenever the heater was turned on at night or early morning, it would wake us up. Other than that, it was a great place, really spacious and comfortable, and a wonderful location, and I would definitely stay there again if those issues were fixed.  What a big space and what a lovely part of town! Brian was a gracious host, he provided a clean and comfortable environment. He was very prompt in responding to any communiques and helping us with anything we needed. Le Tigre was quite the lovely outdoor and cat and indeed, the shower was great. I would most certainly stay here again when I visit Seattle next.  Very nice place to stay clean and comfortable. It met our needs for our evening in Ballard. Neighborhood is nice and walking distance to downtown. We did not get to meet Brian but he had everything in place and was responsive when we had questions about our stay.  Brian was an amazing host, and the space we stayed in was far beyond our expectations. Every detail added to our great experience... The projector, the comfy couch and bed, and spacious room... We couldn\\'t have imagined a better place to relax after picking up my sister from UW. \\nBrian also kindly went above and beyond to return a makeup bag that meant a lot to me! Thanks again! This was my first Airbnb experience. Brian was great. Although we never met he was VERY accommodating. We had our agenda and he had his I\\'m sure. Brian\\'s place has big, very clean, quiet and very close to the bus line. We talked about staying again if we were in the neighborhood.  The house was in a great neighborhood, easy to find and navigate through without GPS!  Brian made a great map of things to do, and places to go. His place was very kid friendly, I made dinner for my boys, we watched movies and made ourselves at home for the night. We had a great time staying at Brian\\'s! Very comfortable set-up in the basement in an awesome neighborhood! He had great suggestions on things to do and places to eat and drink in the area which was super helpful!  Great. Easy. Convenient. Comfortable. Clean. No problems. :) Loved how quiet and dark the bedroom was. Slept well. We very much appreciated Brian\\'s quick response to our request.  The location of this home allowed us to walk to local stores and it was a perfect starting point for bike riding around Lake Union.  The home was very quiet and the bed very comfortable. This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was a very positive one. Brian was great at responding to texts about anything, including tips about the area. There were helpful notes posted with relevant information about the place (how to lock up, magazines about the area, etc.)The place was very clean, comfortable and we particularly enjoyed making friends with Le Tigre.  Thanks for making our stay in Seattle great!  We did a quick overnight and this listing was perfect. It was clean, comfortable, easy to find. Brian has a small makeshift kitchen area with everything needed to do a quick meal. We traveled with our son and Brian set up a nice aerobed for him. If we were to use AirBNB again in Seattle, we would book this (website hidden): We never met Brian because he respectfully left us alone.  Fantastic location for a visit to Seattle. We took the bus from right near the house to downtown rather than battle traffic and parking and were please with how smoothly that went. Ballard is scenic and gave us a nice idea of that modern-mixed-Victorian residential part of the city. The local food options were fun and trendy too; we lucked out for an incredible breakfast and coffee at The Hen. Brian\\'s suite was fine for a night, and our young kids loved all the toys. Thanks for a positive first experience with airbnb! Brian provided a lot of information about the unit and the area, check-in was smooth and we liked the neighbourhood and the easy transport connections downtown. However I couldn\\'t call the place clean. The shower, bedding etc. were fine but the windows, windowsills, and shelves had been neglected. Dead flies, and some live moths, too. Definite basement smell.  everything was there refer coffe micro toaster  coffe maker   Brian was an excellent host. The basement was a great deal and had everything we needed. The ceiling was not too short, which another reviewer said it might be. This spot is the perfect place for a family to stay. My 4-yr-old asked Brian if he had any airplane toys and when we got back from our Seattle adventures several little planes sat on the welcoming table. It was a super sweet gesture that he went and found them for my little boy. I recommend this spot to anyone wanting to stay in the Ballard area. Great location, huge space that is well set up for a quick layover in Seattle. Ample parking, easy access to coffee shops and parks. Very accommodating host who even set up a *nice* air mattress for our additional people. Thanks Brian! Staying at Brian\\'s home exceeded all expectations. Brian was kind, polite, and helpful. Most importantly, we felt we were more than welcome here. This place felt like home. The basement is spacious; the queen size bed is super comfy; the yard is ideal for a BBQ on a beautiful day. We hit the jack pot with this place! All in all, we will never stay at a hotel again if we can help it. Fantastic place!  Three of us stayed at Brian\\'s finished basement in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle overnight on Labor Day weekend.  The space is large, clean, quiet.  The location is very good, about a mile from good shops, bars, and Sunday outdoor market.\\r\\nWe met Brian briefly just before we left, and he gave us suggestions for touring the area. Brian\\'s private basement was perfect for us! It was clean and large and extremely comfortable beds and couches. All the amenities you would need. We had the pleasure of meeting Brian when we needed a favor and he was very accommodating. For three women traveling alone it was a very safe environment and neighborhood. This was our 2nd airbnb experience and we were delighted. Highly recommend.  Brian was a very good host- allowed our privacy, and was available to speak to when we were there. Very comfortable beds and great amenities! Loved the privacy! Great house in a great location. Was made to feel welcome, and given plenty of privacy. Definitely recommended!  Great place to stay- good area, spacious, clean and comfortable. Brian was was helpful and and flexible with our move out time. Definitely recommend his place!  We had a relaxing time in Brian\\'s basement! It was very private and spacious and easy to come and go late at night. Great location and super clean place. The house looks haunted in the photo but it\\'s just Seattle weather. Brian\\'s spot was great, conveniently located close to all the great spots in Ballard. The sheets were amazingly comfortable and it was a good private stay. We thoroughly enjoyed it and will use it again. Great and cozy little place in the basement, very good location for those exploring Seattle. The best part was the projector provided because my friends and I had so much fun watching movies and relaxing after a long day out in the city. Kid friendly for those with kids! The host was very kind and easy to contact. First experience w air bnb. Absolutely perfect! Room was clean and super trendy, with a comfy bed. People living there were so nice and hospitable  The host canceled this reservation 44 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Alex has a very cool room for rent. The bed is super comfy. The location is great easy access to downtown. Alex is a great host, made us feel at home. Alex\\'s roommates are also helpful and pleasant. Definitely would recommend. Alex is an incredibly fun and laid back host, smart and a little crazy in the best possible way. Communication was excellent, the house is very clean and very pretty, the room fairly clean and supercool, the housemates extremely helpful and Ballard a neighborhood worth while visiting, green, peaceful and beautiful, and 15 minutes away from old Ballard with many many bars, restaurants and fun things to do. We had a wonderful time here! Thank you so much, Alex! Alex, and his roommates were incredibly cool, laid back and helpful. I had never been to Seattle before, so I was looking for recommendations and directions. They were quick to help with both. Alex was amazing at communicating and making sure I knew how to get in the house (since he was at work when I got to town), and the one time he needed something out of the room, was nice enough to text me to make sure it was cool to go in and get it. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was extremely comfortable. The weather was beautiful, so I slept with the windows open, and there was plenty of airflow. This is the only trip I\\'ve ever been on that I didn\\'t miss my own bed 2 days in. \\r\\n\\r\\nBallard is beautiful and the house is a 15-20 minute walk away from Market St. which has a bunch of really good restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and a cool little movie theater. If you don\\'t feel like walking, and Uber ride costs roughly $4, and $13-$19 to downtown Seattle.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI highly recommend staying here. I stayed at Alex\\'s place for roughly five days in the Ballard area of Seattle. He left clear directions of how to get into the house. His roommates were very welcoming and gave us info about places to go eat and about a festival in Seattle. It was my first experience with AirBNB and I will not hesitate to recommend the site and Alex.  This was my first time using AirBnB. At first I was nervous about staying with strangers, but after meeting Alex I knew I was going to be fine. Upon meeting him he was very friendly and accommodating. He welcomed us in, showed us around, and explained where everything was. We stay a week and it was wonderful. :) Alex and his friends would ask us where we are going each day and gave suggestions. They made sure we were okay. It honestly felt like staying at a friends house rather than a stranger. I would definitely stay there again. :) Alex\\'s place was so nice to stay at. The groovy pad looks just like it does in pictures. The place is in a very nice neighborhood and it was close to a bus stop. He was very responsive and kept to himself most of the time which worked well for us! :) His roommates were also very nice. I\\'d definitely  stay here again. Alex has a lovely, comfortable room. The 70s decorations are awesome and the location, Ballard, is great as well. Arranging the room went smoothly and Alex communicates well. His roommates are also very friendly and approachable. Overall, if you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle, I can recommend Alex\\' room! I didn\\'t get to meet Alex but the room was very much as described, the housemates were really nice and it was overall a very friendly atmosphere. The location is great a nice stroll to all the Ballard bars and venues. I found the location very convenient to explore the Ballard, Freemont and Wallingford neighborhoods which was my intention for this trip and I very much recommend you to stay here if this interests you. They are more laid back and less urban neighborhoods than closer to downtown but still vibrant and you will find plenty of options of food and live music and more. Great place, clean and very comfortable. Love the urban residential charm. In the city with trees! Good nights sleep. It was the best airbnb experience I\\'ve ever had! Sabrina was a such a wonderful host. The place matches the pictures (looks even better in person). The neighborhood was quiet and easy to find parking just outside the house. There are restaurants and cafes nearby as well.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe home decor is artistic and absolutely beautiful. Sabrina was very thoughtful that she put notes everywhere in the house to give us kind reminders. (e.g where to find a working outlet, where is coffee, wifi code...etc) All the shower essentials are provided including a makeup remover! She even gave us postcards WITH STAMPS to send home. \\r\\n\\r\\nSay no more! I HIGHLY recommended to stay at Sabrina\\'s! Feels just home :) Sabrina\\'s house was great for our long weekend in Seattle. Very accurate listing and cute neighborhood. We found it easy to get around without any trouble due to being close to public transit and using ubers. Very cute home and has all the essentials and more (loved the stamped postcards and treats!). Sabrina was out most of the weekend, but we still felt welcome and at home! Thanks Sabrina! Sabrina\\'s house is the most nice house I have been.The house is very beautiful and cute.Sabrina writes some notes make me warm.If I will come back Seattle,I will come back here. Great place with many unique touches that made us feel welcome. It\\'s also within walking distance to cafes and the Ballard street market. Sabrina was a great host. Sabrina was a gracious host. Her house was clean, warm, inviting and beautifully decorated. Sabrina let us check in early and responded to all our questions quickly. We had a great visit thanks to Sabrina.  What a wonderful experience. Sabrina is a terrific host. She made us feel extremely welcome. The room was exactly what we needed. The postcards and breakfast pizza were added bonuses and very much appreciated.  Sabrina welcomed us with a cute note on the front door when we arrived. The room was decorated nicely and the whole house has an amazing, decorative and fun feel to it. I enjoyed the coffee in the morning! Good location close to Ballard area, which we were interested in checking out. Overall a nice stay. The description of the house is very accurate. Sabrina was very quick with her communication, and arriving at her house and getting settled was a cinch! She has cute labels throughout the house to help guide guests. The room is in the basement (along with a sitting area and TV for relaxation), and she provides extra blankets but we were warm and cozy. I\\'m grateful for such a positive first Airbnb experience!  Sabrina is an excellent and exceptionally friendly host and I felt warmly welcomed in her home during my stay in Seattle for work. Her home is a uniquely and pleasantly designed interior space, showcasing her creative talents and attention to detail. Not only are the accommodations comfortable, the living space downstairs creates a nice place to relax after a long day in town. Her place is  easily accessible to downtown Seattle via the bus line a half block away that runs every 15 minutes. I look forward to staying at Sabrina\\'s place again! Well located a short bus ride to downtown,  and near all sorts of interesting places to explore. Eclectic and interesting decor inside, with a ton of personal touches. The helpful notes throughout the house along with the welcome message on the front door make it friendly and comfortable. The bed suffers from roll together if there are two of you. Corinne and her husband were absolutely wonderful. From the immaculately made bed to the rolled towels, they made us feel completely at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were also able to offer up some great information about their--and surrounding--neighborhood, with all the cool stuff to do. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf ever in need, we will likely stay with them again! My friend Allegra and I were on tour and had a couple days off so we decided to make a trip to Seattle.  We found Corinne on airbnb and she responded to our request very pomply.  She and her husband and three dogs were super friendly and welcoming.  The room was very private and comfortable and it was overall a very pleasent stay.  We were treated to coffee and tea in the morning, and they even gave us four cans of gingerale and a bouquet of daiseys from their front yard for the road!  I would definitely recommend their place to anybody looking for a place in the Seattle metro area! I really enjoyed the time I\\'ve stayed at the house of Corinne and Tom. They are very friendly and warm-hearted. The neighborhood is quiet nice and there are plenty of good coffee bars und restaurants around. You have to be comfortable with dogs because there are three of them - but very cute. I can definitly recommend this location! My recent stay with Corinne and Tom made for an excellent second Airbnb experience!\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything was exactly as described.  The large bedroom has a very comfortable bed, perfect for a good night\\'s rest after a wedding reception that went late into the night.  Their three dogs are very friendly; and Corinne and Tom generously offered everything from local maps and neighborhood information to coffee and Canada Dry\\'s Green Tea Ginger Ale (which coincidentally happens to be one of my favorite beverages.)\\r\\n\\r\\nI would rate Corinne and Tom as nothing less than five-star hosts, and I wouldn\\'t hesitate to see if they are available during my next trip to Seattle. Corinne and Tom were great hosts and were able to accomodate me on short notice. They were super friendly and Corinne was super helpful sharing info on getting around the Seattle area. They even invited to join them and their friends for dinner. How cool is that?  Corinne and Tom (and the dogs) were such gracious hosts to my boyfriend and I. Their place was spotless, they were kind to make coffee, give us restaurant recs and help us with anything we needed.  They told us all about the Seattle culture and about life there. Really wonderful couple with a positive, open outlook. We hope to stay in touch with them when they are in the bay area! Corinne and her husband were so NICE! It was a first time experience to do Air B&B for us and they made it so easy and pleasant. The room is large and comfortable, their dogs are adorable, and the house itself is impeccably clean and very well decorated. Corinne was helpful in giving tips about exploring the area and was very easy to talk to. I thouroughly enjoyed my stay and would have liked to spend more time there if I could have!  Wonderful place to stay with great hosts. Thank you so much!! We enjoyed a welcoming and comfortable weekend with Tom and Corrine. Our communication with Corrine prior to arrival was efficient and with easy. We appreciate the conversations, warm acceptance into their home, and overall hospitality. And, their dogs--Ninja, Butters, and Sky--are well-behaved and lots of fun! Corinne and Tom were very interesting people to talk to and gave us lot of information on traveling within the Seattle area.  Their place is conveniently located to the bus lines and other attractions are within walking distance.  The room was clean and quiet.  We would definitely stay again! Corinne and Tom are phenomenal hosts and made us feel right at home for our long weekend in Seattle. The room is exactly as advertised. They have a lovely home! Its super convenient to downtown, just a 15 minute bus ride away, and sits in the middle of a great neighborhood. I\\'d recommend Corrine and Tom\\'s place to anyone who wants to spend  time in Seattle. I absolutely loved my stay at Corinne and Tom\\'s lovely, charming, beautiful home in Ballard. They are absolutely wonderful hosts - with an unlimited amount of knowledge about great bars and restaurants to check out in the neighborhood, and things to do around Seattle. The location is conveniently located to essential bus lines, and an easy walk to downtown Ballard. Their dogs are adorable and  I\\'d happily recommend their place to anyone looking to travel to Seattle.  Comfortable, well-maintained home in quiet area. The dogs were friendly and very well behaved.  We absolutely loved our stay in Tom and Corrine\\'s beautiful home with their lovely dogs. Tom and Corrine are both very friendly and helpful and made us feel right at home. Our room was large and spacious and very comfortable for our 5 days in Seattle. We also loved the location. Ballard is full of amazing eateries and cafes and bars that are just a walk away. A beighbourhood that we both felt would siit us perfectly if we lived in Seattle. Nice and easy to catch the bus into town when we did. We would love to stay with them again if in Seattle.  Corinne and Tom (and the dogs) were excellent hosts! They let us use the kitchen and (awesome) barbecue whenever we wanted, the room was large and comfortable, and they gave us lots of great recommendations for things to do. We spent one evening in the neighborhood (Ballard) and two in other areas (downtown, Capitol Hill) and it was very easy to get around on the bus. If you don\\'t mind dogs, this place is great! I\\'d be happy to come back again.  Corinne and Tom were super friendly and their home was beautiful and very clean. We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend them to friends who are looking for a place in Seattle. :)  This was my second stay with Corinne and Tom. The arrangements were made with ease and I was met with homey hospitality. The room (as well as the rest of the house) was familiar and comfortable. Corrine and Jim are very friendly, helpful and open.  The house is in a good, convenient neighborhood, and the room was big and the bed comfortable.  Bathroom upstairs was only issue,but they are putting a small one near room in near future.   At that point, for the price, I can give it easily 5 stars.  We would stay again next time in Seattle. This was my third stay with Corinne and Tom, and it was another pleasant experience! The fourth time was still a charm! Thank you, Corinne and Tom! This was our first time staying with Corinne and Tom. We were staying for 2 nights during our apartment hunt in Seattle. The house is wonderful as are Corinne and Tom. The 3 dogs, Sky, Ninja, and Butters were very energetic and I miss them already. Thanks again for the stay and yes, we found a house to rent! I had a great stay with Corinne and Tom! They were super helpful and if you like dogs, you\\'ll love their three. Their space is warm and comfortable. I stayed with them for two nights while I explored different neighborhoods in Seattle to relocate to. They offered great advice on where to look, food to try, things to do, etc. They helped make my location scouting all the more easy. If I ever needed to, I would definitely stay with them again! Corinne&Tom are wonderful people, always trying to help and support their guests. They made my trip to Seattle a lot easier and more enjoyable. I loved staying with these lovely, friendly, warm, helpful and good-natured people, and their three amazing dogs, and I can highly recommend them! Thank you for your hospitality! Corinne and Tom were wonderful hosts! They respect mine and my mom\\'s privacy and made us feel like it was our home away from home. The Ballard neighborhood was very quiet and charming as well. Although it took longer that we thought to get to downtown, the local rapid ride bus ran every 10 to 15 minutes, so we did not have much problems. Thank you again you guys! Super nice hosts, great pooches and the house is located around a mile from the fun hang out area in Ballard. Bedroom is downstairs in the basement with plenty of privacy, bathroom is shared upstairs. Great hospitality! Communication with Corinne was easy and her place was great--plus located just a quick walk from a really delicious bakery. I only wish we\\'d been in town long enough to spend some time lounging in the hammock in the backyard. I\\'d definitely stay with her again if I find myself in Seattle in the future.   I had a great stay with Corinne and Tom.  The room was comfortable and they were flexible to my schedule and very gracious hosts (even left me homemade pie).  Only wish I had more time to enjoy their peaceful neighborhood and backyard.\\r\\n\\r\\n We had a pleasant experience staying in Corinne\\'s bedroom.  We would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Ballard.   We stayed for five nights and had a wonderful time in Seattle. Corinne and Tom are super friendly and helpful. They pointed us to some locations and activites that we would have missed without them. The place is conveniently located in beautiful Ballard and close enough to bars and restaurants to walk there. We also enjoyed sitting outside and relaxed in the beatiful garden. We\\'d definitly stay again with Tom and Corinne.  Corinne and Tom are fantastic hosts (coffee in the morning! bar recommendations!) and the room is a very comfortable place to come back to after exploring Ballard. It\\'s a lovely walk through a beautiful neighbourhood full of trees and interesting houses (and what\\'s with all those vintage cars?) to the heart of Ballard where you\\'ll find excellent food and drink and happy hours. We had a great great a weekend. Sweet pups are a bonus! Corinne and Tom were super accommodating hosts for my stay at their place.  The neighborhood is quiet and within a few minutes drive to many good restaurants and bars.  The living space is great as you have the entire lower level of their home for yourself.   Corinne & Tom were wonderful hosts. (Skye, Butters, and Ninja the pups too!) The house was comfortable, clean, and the room was downstairs with lots of privacy. They had fresh coffee for us every morning and breakfast foods available if we had been around for it. Downtown Ballard was a 15 minute or so walk, so it was the perfect location for us. Thank you! Staying with Corinne and Tom was a WONDERFUL experience! Great host with great suggestion for things to do & eat around the city.  The room had tons of space, with a hanger rack, a lounging chair, a fan if it gets hot (though you dont need it), beautiful art work surrounding the walls and one of the most comfortable beds I\\'ve ever slept on!  There was relaxing, subtle music playing the entire time we were there, which was a very nice touch that made us feel a little more at home.  If you plan on driving, not to worry because there\\'s a tons of street parking.  I HIGHLY recommend staying with Corinne and Tom, they are one of the sweetest people we\\'ve met, and their wonderful, adorable dogs made us feel even more at home!  My only regret was we didn\\'t stay there long enough!   Enjoyed my extended weekend in Ballard and exploring various tree lined roads with older houses into downtown Ballard about a mile and a half away.  The D line bus is close by with easy access to downtown Seattle. Tom and Corinne were good, conversational hosts and helpful with directions to local restaurants.  Very friendly dogs after a few brief barks when they quickly quiet down.  The room in the basement is large with a comfy bed.  Bathroom is upstairs on the main floor. Corinne is super Friendly and he place is well located. Her dogs are super cute and my partner and I enjoyed our stay.  Corinne was a great host. She was very friendly and nice. I could easily find a parking spot around her place. Her dogs were well trained and didn\\'t bother me at all. The room in the basement was large, private, and confortable. I enjoyed staying at her place. Thank you!  Corinne and Tom were incredibly welcoming and accommodating  Corrine had great tips about where to eat and hang out in the area. I\\'ll definitely try to stay with them the next time I\\'m in the area!\\r\\n We had a great time staying with Corinne and Tom!  Delightful and very friendly hosts (+dogs!).  Would definitely stay again...thanks! Always a great stay with Corinne and Tom! Really nice neighborhood with great tacos down 15th at Camion, and a lot of night life down on Ballard Very friendly and nice people.  Helpful and accommodating.\\n\\nRoom is very private and located in the basement.  Comfortable bed.  \\n\\nGood location and good price..   I was in town just for 24 hours on my way to the mountains. I was visiting a friend who lives nearby in Ballard. Corinne\\'s place was great: quiet, comfortable, and well-located for my activities. Corinne and her husband were very friendly and accommodating. The room was comfortable, well equipped for guests and quiet. The location was close to my business appointments. I appreciated their ability to take a guest with only a day\\'s notice. Thanks!  Corinne and Tom were very flexible in meeting our needs and that of our 22-year old daughter.  Thanks to them, we were able to experience the area in a way that would not have been possible otherwise.   Wonderful time in Ballard!  Corinne and Tom and their three dogs greeted us on the evening we arrived.  The room was very private with a comfortable bed and even had a fridge outside of our room for leftovers or beer!  I appreciated being able to use a dresser for my clothes and feel settled. The bathroom (shared) was very clean and had great water pressure for the shower. They also had helpful maps and books in the room.  Corinne and Tom made freshly brewed coffee for us each am- and they even got us some fresh flowers for our room!  Corinne was a great resource and showed us the lay of the land on our first night in town- we had similar tastes in bars/food etc. so I appreciated her suggestions.  We explored most of Ballard via foot- but could have chosen to take the bus if we wanted.  We also made daytrips downtown and to Freemont very easily via the bus.  If you explore by foot- be prepared to walk a bit.  If you want to go all around Seattle- you may want to rent a car.  Great place to stay with cool people at a great price.  We would go again for sure!   We only saw Corinne and she was very nice and helpful! The room is big and very nicely furnished with lots of guide books about Seattle that were very helpful to us. Plus very clean!\\r\\n\\r\\nBeware there are 2 small dogs and 1 big one, but they keep them with them at night in their bedroom so you can go to the bathroom without worrying.\\r\\n\\r\\n We enjoyed Corinne and Tom\\'s hospitality very much. Their space is comfortable and the location is great, great bus access to Seattle Fantastic experience! Tom and Corrine were very warm and made us feel right at home. They were also very helpful in telling us about the city. We would highly recommend staying with them. Nice room and great price.  Bed and linens were really comfy.  I so appreciate cotton sheets!  Good maps and Seattle tourist info including bus schedules which would be nice for those who need it. Everything was spotless and there was a large TV room with a comfy couch next to our room in the basement.  Nice hosts and we enjoyed the coffee made for us in the morning.  The evening that we were there the hosts were gone. The three dogs take there guard duty seriously. They bark at passerby\\'s on the street and bark when you come in and when you come upstairs until they become accustomed to your presence. This was okay with us but might be a problem for some folks.   BIG basement bedroom! Plenty of privacy! Coffee in the morning! Pretty cool! Hosts were SOOOOOOOOOOOOO nice!!!!!!! P.S cute doggies! This was my first Airbnb experience so I don\\'t have any comparisons, however it was very positive and the type of travel experience I envisioned. Corinne\\'s house is located in a suburb, but well serviced by the local bus to the heart of Seattle {under 1/2 hour}. Its about a 20 minute walk to downtown Ballard which is very happening. I had a comfortable stay and Corinne was very personable and helpful.If you aren\\'t at ease with dogs, three, try elsewhere, but I\\'ll go back to Corinne\\'s on my next visit to Seattle. Corinne and Tom were incredible hosts! Staying with them while I got to know Seattle and searched for apartments was the best way to transition to a new city. They were so helpful with neighborhood  recommendations in addition to being super flexible with move in and move out dates. The room was tidy, quiet and felt very separate from the rest of house. In general, a great first experience in Seattle.  I stayed with Corinne and Tom after my other plans fell through, and I\\'m so glad I did!  My only regret was that it was such a quick trip.  Their house was lovely and the room itself was cozy and quiet.  I only got a chance to glance at the bookshelf in the room but I loved that they had all sorts of info on Seattle, as well as some books about Jimi Hendrix and Nirvana. Corinne and Tom were so gracious and welcoming even though they were getting ready for a night out when I arrived.  And the dogs were cute and hilarious... It was nice to get some puppy love. I would definitely stay here again on future trips to Seattle! Corinne and Tom were wonderful and the space was very private and quiet. They are very friendly and accommodating and although I was only there one night, I enjoyed my stay very much. The neighborhood is lovely and very walkable, and Corinne and Tom are knowledgable hosts, and the dogs are very cute! I recommend them without hesitation and would easily stay with them again. Great experience! Corinne and Tom were very warm and welcoming. The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. Would definitely consider staying over again. Corinne and Tom were such great hosts. They are super helpful and friendly. One of the best AirBnB experiences in Seattle to-date!\\r\\nThe room was extra clean and comfy. The location was pretty close to Ballard. Would definitely stay again. I\\'ll echo everything else that has been said about this listing. It is a wonderfully quiet and private space. The room is in the basement separate from the main house and it is a great spot for a good night\\'s sleep. The bed really is as comfortable as everyone touts it to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrine and Tom were very welcoming and I would recommend them as hosts for anyone looking to visit the area. We very much enjoyed our very brief stay at Corrine and Tom\\'s! The space in their lovely house was private, clean, and comfy. We could walk to our cooking class at Delancey, it was even walkable to the other central part of Ballard, and parking was easy. We will definitely come again, hopefully for longer next time! Thanks greatly for your hospitality, Corrine and Tom! Corrine and Tom were incredibly warm and welcoming and went to so many lengths to ensure we felt at home. The room we stayed in was private, cozy and quiet and stocked full of helpful information about Ballard, Seattle and the surrounding areas--not to mention a great library of books that we took advantage of!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe really enjoyed chatting with them in the morning over the delicious coffee they offered us and loved petting their cute doggies. \\r\\n\\r\\nI really fell in love with Ballard while we stayed there. Corrine and Tom\\'s home is just a short walk to all the great restaurants, bars, cafes and boutiques that Ballard is home to. I would definitely stay with them again if we go back!! The room and host were delightful and exactly as the post described. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle for a few days! My one-night stay with Tom and Corinne was wonderful!  They have thought of everything a traveler could want - guide books, multiple mirrors, plenty of drawer space (if I was staying longer), rack for hanging clothes, fridge/microwave, coffee in the morning and much more.  Very kind and accommodating couple.  Very charming house, interesting books and fun art, great location, cute and well-behaved dogs - I couldn\\'t have asked for a better experience for my first airbnb stay! Corinne & Tom were wonderful hosts and made my first airbnb experience a pleasurable one.  Helpful and hospitable hosts, great location, friendly and fun group of pups, parking was easy, everything was positive. Loved staying with Corinne and Tom again! :) It was great staying with Corinne and Tom.  They were very accommodating.  And also their dogs are all really sweet. Corinne was so fabulous about communications, and working with my flight delays. Their home is beautiful and cheery. Highly recommended. My friend and I stayed at Corinne\\'s home for one night and it was great! The room was very private and very cozy. The bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom was newly redone and beautiful! Corinne was super accommodating and gave us a lot of suggestions on places to check out in Ballard. We had a wonderful time!  Staying with Corrine in Seattle was awesome! Corrine is very thoughtful, and even with my miscommunication about check in (totally my fault) she was very understanding. The private entrance to the room was easy to find and provided plenty of privacy. The location is wonderful, near all of the fabulous things in Ballard, including Honore Bakery (yummy!) We had the pleasure of meeting Corrine the next morning during our checkout, along with her adorable dogs. We would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Seattle. =) Corinne and Tom are great hosts, and I really enjoyed their space. A very comfortable room, great location, a wonderful experience. They provided maps and tips for the city, which were a great help in finding my way around and places to eat/visit. Will definitely check them out again when I head back to Seattle.  Corrine and her husband were wonderful hosts. Very clean and cozy accommodations. Ballard is a neat neighborhood and close to downtown.  Corinne was a warm and inviting host and her personal touches to enliven the space were found everywhere.  And, wow, the new private bathroom is awesome.  We found getting around Seattle was easy from this Ballard site and it was nice coming back to a \\'less traveled\\' area after a day in the city.  Looking forward to meeting Tom next visit.  Thanks Corinne.\\r\\nSal & Jim\\r\\n\\r\\n The space was fantastic!  Corinne has a great eye for decor and has created a space that is aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.  She has thought of every possible need for the traveler and provided appropriately.  Very hospitable and friendly as her four legged friends are great greeters. The room is very clean, inviting and private.  I would definitely contact Corinne to request another stay. This was my first booking through AirBnB, so I appreciated Corinne\\'s timely and clear communication with me.  Corinne and Tom were friendly and welcoming hosts.  The house is located in a quiet neighbourhood and is close to a bus stop, which made travel to downtown Seattle very convenient.  The guest suite was clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was immaculate.  My friend and I definitely enjoyed our stay here.   Corinne and Tom\\'s basement guest space is just fabulous. So cozy and welcoming, with every thoughtful touch. Comfortable bed, well-stocked kitchenette, full bathroom with a great shower head and toiletries provided, etc. A livingroom space is also included, complete with board games, seattle guides, TV and a pretty fish tank! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is quiet, clean, very walkable and close to several little cafés, pubs, etc. Corinne created a helpful list of places with descriptions that is available for reference in the bedroom. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur stay there was perfect and the care Corinne and Tom put into their guests\\' comfort and enjoyment is very evident! Thanks, guys! This was our first Airbnb experience and it was great! Corinne was a perfect host and very helpful. Her binder of restaurants and nano-breweries was spot on. The bed was warm and cozy, especially the electric blanket, and the private shower was perfect. Ballard is a beautiful little neightbourhood, so close to Seattle to be convenient, yet filled with great little restaurants and coffee shops you\\'d never need to leave. My wife and I would definitely stay here again.  Corrine and Tom were very friendly and welcoming. They were careful to give us great instructions on arriving at their home, and checking with us to see if we needed anything. Corinne definitely has a heart for hospitality.......every amenity we could think of (and more) were provided, including fresh fruit. The space was comfortable and private. We will happily stay there again! Corinne was our first Airbnb host and we couldn\\'t be happier with our stay!  Our room was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean with the comfiest bed and heated blanket!  She was so kind to have some fruit in the kitchenette waiting for us as well as a beautifully clean private bathroom stocked with very nice toiletries! She was very accommodating to have our pup stay the night and was so kind to let him out and give him some snuggles and water while we were out! She was ready with wonderful recommendations for neighborhood eats, one place we could even bring our dog too! \\r\\nNow we feel like we have a home in Seattle to return to whenever we plan our next trip! My mother, my son and I had a wonderful stay with Corinne. Her and her husband were so welcoming and were so sweet to us in our time of need when poor mother wasn\\'t well. The basement is cosy and sweet and has everything you could need. There is lots of information in the room about Seattle and the bus into town is so close. We had a wonderful time and would definitely recommend it. This is a nice room in Seattle. We have enjoy the private space and cleaning room, and the washroom is so new. The host is so nice too and j love his two little dogs. Haha.  Wonderful stay with Corrine and Tom. I had the whole basement to myself, and the house and yard are lovely.  Corinne and her husband were very pleasant and provided us with a pleasant place to stay. The neighborhood had some nice little eateries.  Ballard, which is a long walk or short drive had some very good places to eat.  The bed was very comfortable.  There was also a comfy couch to relax on.  There was a small heater which we used to take the chill out the Seattle air. We only spent one night, but the space was really great, well-decorated and comfortable and with TONS of local information.  Corinne was very welcoming.  Also, if you\\'re planning on going car-free, it\\'s a great location.  The bus line just a few blocks away (I think it\\'s the 15?) will take you all the way downtown in less than half an hour.  You can also walk to some great spots in downtown Ballard, plus there are a few really fun local spots.  We hope to stay there again. Staying with Corinne was convenient and comfortable! She accommodated a very last minute request and although I only met her the morning I left, she was very responsive and answered any and all questions I had during my stay. The accommodations were very clean and comfortable, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat!  Two nights of comfort in an artfully decorated, and homey environment,  with plenty of privacy and any ammenity that I might have needed.  Corinne was the sweetest of hosts, very helpful, accommodating, and flexible.  I highly recommend this listing, and hope that I can stay here again. Corinne\\'s room in Ballard is the perfect getaway from the city. It is a 20-minute walk from the main streets of Ballard, and the room is lovely. Corinne made sure I had everything I needed - and the room also comes with essential kitchen utensils (coffee-maker, fridge...) so that\\'s a plus. I absolutely recommend this place ! Corrine was very warm and welcoming, made us feel quite at home. She was kind enough to let us leave our bags when our flight came in early. We weren\\'t around much to visit with her, but the room was more than we expected. We loved the extra little amenities like the provided laptop, lavender bath products, little kitchenette, and entertainment area. Location was perfect and everything with spic and span. Will def recommend or stay here again! Host made me feel at home for beginning until I left. Went over and above helping with tools to put furniture together with adult daughter who recently moved to Ballard, provided much needed ice and holistic healing after a minor accident right as I was leaving. Very quiet neighborhood with wonderful area to exercise. Beautiful Sunset Park on 75th street w/in a mile walk offered breathtaking view of Puget Sound & Olympus Mountain Range. We had a wonderful time with this host.  The room was very nice, the neighborhood convenient to all we were doing and in general was a quiet neighborhood.   They did a very nice job at making us feel welcomed and they have developed a very nice space for people to stay in.  I highly recommend them as hosts. Corinne made my first airbnb experience a wonderful one. She was friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and spacious. My wife and I spent one night there and hopefully we can spend more nights there.  Aardige verhuurster en prima abonnement in Ballard. \\r\\nHet was soms iets gehorig, maar we hebben prima geslapen.\\r\\nHet kunnen ontbijten in de tuin in de zon was heerlijk!!!! Nice stay at Corinne\\'s place : the room is well decorated and quiet big, and so is the bathroom. We could use the couch is the media room  so it was perfect. The garden is very nice too, we could enjoy a meal since Corinne let us use her kitchen, which was very kind of her. We didn\\'t have much interaction with our hosts however but they provide written information in the room. The home is a bit far away from the center of Ballard or other places in Seattle, if you don\\'t have a car and to take common transportation as we did (Seattle is built a several hills, so not that easy to walk from any places!). There was no fruits or cereals as mentionned in the description, but there was coffee and tea. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Ballard with Corrine and Tom.\\r\\nThey went out of their way to make sure every detail was perfect.  I was very comfortable, had plenty of privacy, lots of space and was very happy with the residence. Liked the space, great new bathroom. Good bed.\\r\\nEnjoyed a sunny Seattle lounging in the back yard\\r\\nreading and recouping from our travels.\\r\\n\"downtown\" Ballard is a fun and interesting place\\r\\nto explore. Great place to rest our heads at night while we explored Ballard and Seattle during the day. It was an easy walk to downtown Ballard and public transportation was close by (though we didn\\'t use it during our stay). The bed was extremely comfortable and we appreciated the oatmeal, mini-fridge, and microwave. There were also lots of nice little touches, e.g., eye mask/ear plugs, chocolates on the pillow, facial cleanser pads, etc. It definitely felt like a home away from home. All in all it was a great first experience with airbnb.  Cute and cozy!  There was a big spider on the wall when I was about to sleep but other than that this was a nice place. (spiders are part of nature and are bound to be in houses so this is not a negative comment!) Also the room has a low ceiling but luckily I\\'m vertically challenged (I\\'m 5ft) so this didn\\'t bother me. For reference, I was able to touch the ceiling on my tip toes. Overall, I\\'d recommend this place. Corinne and Tom were both so accommodating and Corinne especially was so delightful to talk to. I needed a place to stay with my puppy Sunny who is a 4 months old labradoodle and Corinne replied back in minutes and were so flexible with me. When I got to their place, I walked into a very cute backyard and I had a separate entry way into my room area. It felt very private and almost felt like I had a whole place, not a room. The place was extremely clean and the room was equipped with all kinds of helpful information around my way of town. I felt the hosts\\' efforts in little details of the house so that their guests felt comfortable. While my dog was not allowed in the actual room that I stayed in, it was no problem because I brought a crate and my puppy still stayed close to me outside the door. While I was out with friends for dinner, Corinne and her husband were nice enough to take care of Sunny. They took her out for potty breaks and played with her. I felt very comfortable the whole time and felt the location was also excellent. Ballard ave. was full of cute stores and restaurants. I really enjoyed my time there over the actual dt Seattle. I would recommend their place in Seattle. Thanks Corinne and Tom.  Ballard is one of my favorite Seattle neighborhoods. Was great to find Corrine and Tom\\'s place. Very comfortable and Corrine was great at showing me the features of her place.  Corinne and Tom\\'s place was lovely and they had a ton of books on Seattle as well as a binder full of restaurant recommendations that definitely came in handy.  I didn\\'t have many interactions with them  (aside from one nice chat with Corinne) but they definitely seemed available if needed. The room is in the basement and the ceiling is a bit low down there, which wasn\\'t a problem at all for me but if you\\'re quite tall, you might have to duck. Corienne and Tom\\'s beautiful furnished basement was so much lovelier than either my boyfriend or I expected. The living space was large, comfortable, and completely cozy. We slept so well in their large bedroom and enjoyed all of the little perks of the space (small kitchenette, beautiful bathroom, large living room) as well as the adorable personal touches that added to the laid-back character of the entire Ballard area of Seattle. It was charming and absolutely perfect; our hosts were kind, helpful, and extremely accommodating to our every need. We plan to be back again, and we are so thankful our first Air B&B experience was beyond our expectations. Thank you again, Corienne and Tom! Tom and Corinne were great hosts and I would love to be back! The room was immaculate and equipped with everything I needed for the short stay.  It was a lovely stay!  Even though we arrived very late, our hostess came to greet us and give us a quick tour when she heard us come in the door using our own security code. She even cleaned the breakfast area each day and left us fruit once!  When it snowed, she contacted us and let us know where salt for the driveway was - very thoughtful. Quite possibly the best AirBnB experience you will ever get. The space that Tom & Corinne have created has more features than you could ask for, we could have happily stayed for weeks. Keep up the good work! The rooms were spotless and the hosts had a little Christmas tree in my room and home baked cookies one day. The location was perfect and the space was quiet and private. Perfect landing spot for me. Tom greeted me at my car, helped with my luggage and made sure I was fully familiar with the room. Actually the entire lower level. Wonderful location, very comfortable, spacious and great amenities. Would stay again without hesitation. Corrine was extremely warm and welcoming towards us. The listing exceeded our expectations and I found the space to be eclectic, fun, clean, and warm. We would definitely recommend staying with Corrine and Tom. they were more than accommodating :) Perfectly comfortable with every amenity we needed. The space was clean, and cozy and just what we had hoped for. Thank you! Corinne and Tom have created a very comfortable place for any traveler.  The neighborhood is charming, the home is decorated with local class and we were overjoyed to get a good night sleep.  The heart of Ballard is very close by so we were able to have a fabulous dinner and catch a show at a local club.  This was our first time using Airbnb, so we were nervous, but when we entered the home we were immediately put at ease by how clean and thoughtful the space was for guests.  There were even chocolates on our pillow!  It was an all around delightful and memorable stay in Seattle.    Corinne\\'s room/basement was a great escape. It\\'s a great cozy escape in the middle of a quiet neighborhood that my wife and I really enjoyed staying in. I\\'d highly recommend this place to others. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was some noise from their dogs running around upstairs in the evening, but other than that it was perfect night away. Chocolates on the pillow. Spotlessly clean, clear instructions. Beautiful gardens!!1 Our privacy was totally respected. Look forward to staying again.\\r\\n\\r\\n We returned to Corrine and Tom\\'s house for one last night before our departure flight back to Madison...We were gone only 4 nights and I should have put a note on the bed not to change the sheets! Everything perfect once more. Tom caught us as we were leaving to make our acquaintance a really great guy! We will be back! My daughter and her boyfriend will be recommending Corinne and Tom\\'s place to their other out of town visitors...Thanks again! Our hosts, Corinne and Tom were very communicative before we arrived.  A very thorough information sheet was provided with directions and access to the room.   \\r\\nTom met us as we arrived and gave us a perfect tour of the space and the amenities.  \"Here\\'s how to use the media center\" They even provided a tablet for internet had we not had one!\\r\\nWe were so impressed!  More than a room, it felt like a relaxing place to return to at the end of our busy days!  \\r\\nThey provide fixings for coffee, tea, instant oatmeal and you put the dishes in a tub and they washed them!\\r\\nVery nice bath facility.\\r\\nA pleasant surprise was a large basement room with a TV, wonderful decor and fascinating knick-knacks.\\r\\nThe bedroom was just as you see it, a nice rack to hang clothes on, the bed was comfortable and we awoke rested!\\r\\nThey checked in with us each morning to make sure all was well, which indeed it was.   We plan to return and will suggest the place to our family when they go visit our son in Ballard. Corinne+Tom are wonderful hosts and they made us feel at home since we got there and until we left. Corinne+Tom\\'s place is a beautiful, cozy apartment in Ballard (which is an awesome neighborhood). The apartment is conveniently located close to Downtown Seattle and getting there in public transportation was very easy. Corinne+Tom also gave us tips and recommendations around Ballard and we were pleased to learn that Ballard is host to many excellent restaurants, bars and entertainment stores in walking distance. In all, it was a wonderful experience. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  The room is very private, clean and comfortable.  It had all the amenities I needed plus more.  My host was friendly and welcoming.  The neighborhood  is very nice and near restaurants and a great bakery.  I highly recommend this listing! Tom and Corrine\\'s place worked out perfectly for us!  It was spotlessly clean, we had everything we needed and more!  It is in a quiet neighborhood and parking was not an issue for us.  It is near enough to the Heart of Ballard that we spent more time out than in!  Can highly recommend this place and we will definitely be open to staying there again.  We did meet both Tom and Corrine although briefly, as our schedules did not line up.  They were both super nice and friendly, maybe next time we will have more time to chat with them to hear about their travels!  They were wonderful with check in time, it was hard for us to pin down an exact arrival time and having the coded private entry made that a non-issue!  Thanks Tom & Corrine!! \\r\\nCorinne made us feel very welcome: checked on our time of arrival, greeted us, showed us around and how to use the door.  I loved the twinkle lights at the proper gate and around the door entry.  My first Airbnb experience and it was fantastic! Corinne and Tom have a wonderful space that is clean, comfortable, private, and super cute. It\\'s just as depicted and in a friendly, charming neighborhood. We loved having the media room available to hang out in and felt welcomed and comfortable the whole time.  Corrine is awesome! It was such a pleasure to meet you. :) The space is super cozy - it feels like you have a whole apartment to yourself! Decor was neat, shower pressure was perfect and the vibe was just right. She also let us stash our bikes in her garage, which was super helpful. In a great location and with tons of information about Seattle provided. Highly recommend to other guests! Joel and Sarah have a terrific little place!  Very clean, bright and close to Ballard. Highly Recommended! It was nice staying at Joel and Sarah\\'s. The place was really comfortable and clean. You can be downtown in 20 minutes and the bus is right outside the house. Joel and Sarah are really welcoming, with beers in the fridge and ready to help if needed! I would definitely recommend staying at their place. Joel and Sarah\\'s place is really nice.  Beautifully renovated, cozy, clean, well-thought-out.  It\\'s in a lovely home in a residential neighborhood.  They were lovely hosts, and even sent a nice Christmas note and some flowers to welcome our out-of-town guests during the holidays.  We would definitely stay here again.  Everything was really nice and perfect!\\nI really enjoyed staying here during my short trip.\\nI definitely recommend to stay here☺️ The apartment is new to Airbnb, and Ellen did a great job getting everything ready for us.  Ellen was excellent with all communication regarding this listing, and went out of her way to accommodate us on short notice.  The space was clean, open, and well-maintained, and exactly as advertised, definitely more than enough space for the two of us.  We used the kitchen, the wireless internet, and the laundry facilities in the basement.  Everything worked great!  There are many wonderful restaurants and sites within walking distance of this quiet property, and is on one of the main bus routes to downtown Seattle.  Next time we need a place to stay in Ballard, we will be back!  Thanks so much Ellen!!   We really enjoyed our stay here.  The place worked perfectly for the 4 of us.  It was clean, well kept and every bit as  nice as advertised if not better.  Pictures do a very accurate job of displaying the space.  The host was great with communication, prompt and friendly!\\r\\nThanks for a great place to stay! We had an amazing stay at Ellen\\'s beautiful home! It was clean, perfectly located and great style! It felt like a home away from home! It was hard for us to leave. The process to get into the house was great! Ellen is very accomadating and quick to respond! We will definitely be back!!! This was just what we needed! Cutely decorated, comfortable and clean.  Gorgeous place. Loved the vintage tile in one of the bedrooms. Perfect size for the 5 of us (two couples and one single). Very clean, spacious, bright, easy parking, easy to get to, and close to shopping. The loft had all the amenities we needed, with one exception: an iron. We cooked several meals and everything we needed was there. Road noise is fairly loud in the front bedroom, but can\\'t hear it anywhere else in the house. Overall, an excellent choice for our 5 day stay in Seattle. Lovely home right in the heart of Ballard. Quick communication. Thank you for our stay! The place was excellent, very clean, spacious and exactly as described! Would definitely stay there again!!! Ellen was amazing! Great communication and answered every question I had. The Ballard Charmer was perfect for the 5 members of my family and the perfect location among shops and restaurants. Thank you Ellen & Seattle, we had a great stay.  We were spending just one night here as we had come to Seattle to visit friends. We\\'re a family of 5 (parents plus kids ages 3, 5, and 7). We really didn\\'t do much here other than sleep for the night and eat breakfast in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe space was great for what we wanted and would have been comfortable to stay for a week or so. Neighborhood was quiet. We went just up the street to Larsen\\'s bakery for some delicious pastries for breakfast. The space looks very nice, although a lot of the furnishings are old (sink & bathtub particularly).\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, a comfy place to stay in Seattle! I stayed with Farah and Ben for almost a month— and it was a great experience!\\r\\nThey are both easygoing people who will chat with you if you want, or just let you do your own thing if that’s what you’re feeling. They always checked in with me to see how I was doing, and if I needed anything. I had space to store food in the kitchen, was able to use to w/d, and had a little spot in the bathroom for my things there. The location is also very conveniently near a bus stop that takes you to downtown, and the neighborhood itself is nice and quiet. Lots of street parking, and I felt very safe the entire time I stayed there. Overall, I would say a long stay with them would feel very much just like staying in your own house— very convenient, very easy. \\r\\nWould definitely stay with them again! The house and room were clean and nice. Farrah and her boyfriend were friendly. Would definitely recommend. Farah made us feel very welcome in her home. She was excellent at communication and tips and the room was just as described. The neighborhood is safe and she is near an excellent grocery store, coffee shops and bus stop. We were in town to do a class and so had to leave early each morning. As mentioned, this listing has a shared bathroom but at the time of our stay there were 5 of us trying to get ready in one bathroom all at the same time to all leave by 7am. I guess we just assumed it would be us and her using it only.Farah did her best to schedule the times that each person could use the bathroom. I would take into consideration your trip and daily bathroom time use when booking this listing. With that said, you cant beat the price and value for the seattle area. Farah was a great host.  She provided little touches that made one feel welcome such as a night light in the living room, and a towel for your stay.  She was very prompt to reply during the reservation process.  Her home provided all that was needed for a short stay.    The house was awesome, everything was as described, the bed was very comfortable. Farah was super helpful and communicative! Farah was a great host. She welcomed us after normal check in hours because we could not make it early in the day. The room was as pictured, she provided towels for us and the room was clean.  Farah was very accommodating for us. We needed to stop by a little earlier than the listed check in time, and she was more than happy to figure out a time that worked for both us and her. The location was incredibly nice! Ballard is such a cute area, and we were in good walking distance from a lot of different businesses and cute shops.\\r\\n Farah was very accommodating and understanding. We fell in love with the place! The outside of the house is a cute baby blue color and it was absolutely adorable! Prior to our stay, Farah reached out to us and made sure she had all of our toiletries available to ensure our Airbnb was perfect. The house was clean and very homey! 10/10 would recommend :) Wonderful experience for my first Airbnb! The space is clean and somewhat minimalist tho\\' comfy/cozy, which was perfect for this trip!  A lovely neighborhood with restaurants etc within easy walking distance. Ben and Farah are personable and engaging, offered great suggestions for restaurants, tho\\' provided privacy and non-intrusion also as needed.\\nThe only bathroom is a shared one with the hosts, but it really wasn\\'t a problem as only slight scheduling communications took care of it.\\nI will return here again when in the area, and would recommend this space to friends who might travel there as well.\\nThanks for a great first experience! Fatah was great, room was just as described and the location was very nice. Would recommend to anyone who needs a quick place to stay. The house was in a very quiet Ballard neighborhood. The listing was exactly as I found it. Farah was a very welcoming, friendly and pleasant hostess. Farah was more than welcoming. She made us feel right at home. The bedroom was large and quiet. There was plenty of free street parking and downtown was only a seven minute drive away. \\r\\nWe had a great stay at Ballard Bliss. Farah was always fast to respond and the place looks just like the pictures. It is basic and clean. \\r\\n The neighborhood was nice and quiet. It is walking distance to grocery store and many restaurants and stores.\\r\\nWe would recommend Farah\\'s place to anyone who needs a basic place to stay close to Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\n The stay here was very comfortable. Farah was accommodating with our arrival time and welcomed us when we got there. We were pretty exhausted after a day of driving and exploring Seattle so we went into our room and slept pretty quickly. It was only 8:30 or so when we decided to go to bed, but the house was very silent even though it was so early, so we really appreciated that! I would recommend this house to anyone who comes to Seattle! Thanks, Farah! We had a wonderful & comfortable stay at Farah\\'s. The neighborhood was literally few blocks from the market area (restaurants, stores, coffee shops, bars) yet it was so quiet. It was great to share travel stories with Farah :-)  My trip up to Ballard and staying with Farah was very pleasant.  I met her when I arrived and they showed me everything that I asked for. I forgot a towel and she supplied me one.   I did not arrive until the evening  and went to bed early and woke up early, so I did not have much contact with them. The neighborhood is a very quite.  I slept very well.  I will stay here again when I come back for another workshop.   Great room and welcoming host! The house was very clean and quiet. Ballard is a really cool neighborhood to stay in - close to the center of Seattle but with street parking and cool shops/restaurants to explore. Thanks Farah! I had an comfortable but short stay at Farah\\'s place, and enjoyed talking with Farah and Ben. This is a terrific house! We traveled to Seattle for a long weekend with our 13 month old daughter. The house had everything we needed for her: pack-n-play, high chair, stroller, toys and books. And the yard was perfect for her to run around and play. We all enjoyed picking fresh raspberries from the garden. The house also had everything else you would need to cook meals, including a good selection of condiments. It happened to be one of the warmest weekends in a long time (80-90s) and the house did get pretty warm, especially the upstairs bedroom. We spent most of our time in the Ballard/Freemont area, but it was also very easy and quick to get downtown (we rented a car). Jared was very quick to respond to my questions and extremely helpful. The welcoming bottle of wine and coffee was a nice touch! I highly recommend staying at this house. My family and I stayed in this beautiful house in Seattle, it was everything it says in he overview and more!  The location is excellent, close to downtown with local shops in easy walking distance. The house itself was beautiful, and very well laid out, with three good sized bedrooms and lovely places (inside and outside) to sit and read, watch TV or listen to music. It had everything we needed and my daughters had great fun on the fooze ball table in the basement! Our host Jared had everything organised for our stay and we didn\\'t want for anything.  We would highly recommend this house for any families that want more than a hotel room to help the, enjoy a visit to the lovely city of Seattle with its many attractions.  This was an amazing experience for my first airbnb! This home is just beautiful and the whole hosting experience was wonderful. Jared and his \"caretaker\" :-) contacted me well in advance so we all knew what to expect upon arrival and whilst we were staying there. The home is in a fabulous Seattle neighborhood and I loved being there - so much so that I think I will look for a post-doc in the city when I graduate! Staying with Jared is a fabulous experience that is organized, respectful and informative (house manual is awesome as is the basket of local maps and books). Thank you Hawkins\\' family for the lone of your home and also the lovely welcome gift. You guys rock! The house was exactly as described, and we enjoyed our family enjoyed our stay there very much.  The home is well-furnished, very clean and comfortable, with some beautiful modern design features.  The upstairs master bedroom is especially well-crafted, light and airy.  The beds, bedding, household appliances and equipment were excellent. The local contact person, Jennifer, was very welcoming, accommodating and helpful.  The neighborhood is tranquil with ample street parking and within a short drive to Greenlake, Ballard and Fremont.  Jared\\'s house worked very well for us. It was clean and comfortable, and a short drive from Ballard restaurants and amenities. It\\'s particularly suited to families with young children, as it contains lots of toys and amusements for kids, and a bunkbed. Our six-year-old spent 48 hrs playing Monopoly with his grandmother, and cleaned house! Beautifully decorated home. Felt very welcomed, relaxed, and had everything we needed and more We, a family of five, had a great experience. The house is perfectly located, bright, warm and offers everything one needs. Within minutes we were in Ballard for dinner or shopping. Equally fast, we were at the beach enjoying a sunset. Overall, we felt home away from home and thank our hosts for opening their house. Jared has a wonderful house and we really enjoyed our stay there. The location of the house is great and communication with Jared was hassle-free. I would definitely recommend this place to others and would stay there myself during my next trip to Seattle. Jared\\'s house worked perfectly for our family of 5.  We arrived late (after midnight ) and he made arrangements for us to get the key easily.  The house was comfortable and clean and perfectly located for activities in Seattle and the surrounding area.  We were able to take a quick drive into the city for Pike\\'s Market, the Space Needle and a few museums and we also were able to go to Bainbridge Island and Mt Rainier.  And it was nice to come back to the quiet comfort of Jared\\'s home in Ballard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Jared  We had a great stay at Jared\\'s place!  It was comfortable and welcoming.  The space was nicely decorated and we felt like we really lived in Seattle!  We could walk to some cute places and the house was only a short drive to downtown Ballard and the beach.  Jared was quick to respond and Jennifer was super helpful with any questions and with letting us into the house. I would highly recommend this place! House was awesome!  Perfect fit for our family of four.  Great location with some excellent restaurants just a short drive away.  Host was very communicative and responded quickly to questions.  The pictures match the house exactly. We had a wonderful stay at Jared\\'s home; there was a bottle of wine to welcome us and the house was lovely, very clean and comfortable. We found everything we needed and absolutely enjoyed the garden. The neighborhood is great, a quiet residential area but within walking distance of Ballard with its many shops and farmer\\'s market. We enjoyed going to the locks and cruising the area. We also took the bus to go downtown, very easy and the bus stop is only two blocks away. We had a great time! We had a wonderful stay at the Eva Rose apartment! It was in a wonderful location with the ability to walk to many restaurants, coffee shops and more. It was quiet and had everything we needed. They even had a pack n play for us to use for our 7 month old which was so nice. Jeremy was so welcoming and helpful in suggesting places to try out! They had a bottle of wine waiting for us which was a very nice touch! We were visiting to check out Ballard as a potential place to move to and this was the perfect home base to venture out from and see the area. I highly suggest this rental and we will definitely use it again in the future if we move for family/friends! Fantastic stay!!!Thanks again!\\r\\n We had a great girls weekend at Jeremy\\'s and Rachael\\'s place. Jeremy was really responsive to our needs. The location was great...we went for a run jn the neighborhood and enjoyed the local coffee shop,  breakfast, and pizza/bar all within walking distance. The house was closer to the road than we expected, but we were pleased that the unit itself didn\\'t have a lot of road noise. I liked that the unit had a secure exterior gate. The beds were really comfortable too!  Would definitely stay here again.  Jeremy was the first to respond of 3-inquiries in the Seattle area.  I was initially looking specifically downtown  Seattle location but could not find available dates.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce Amazing Ballard was booked, Jeremy was quick to confirm stay for the minimum 3-nights.    And Jeremy kept in contact to check up on us to assure we were doing okay.  My wife and daughter equally loved the space and the location...we did not want to leave!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was some street noise being right on hustling 15th Ave., but the location was a short drive to downtown and the Rapid D-Line stop was just across the street.  We felt safe in the unit with a secured building entrance; electronic codes to the building and unit worked flawlessly...no keys necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe description of the interior space was right on the mark to include hotel like linens, bedding type and kitchen was well stocked.  The décor was stylish; inviting and warm and extremely tidy.\\r\\n\\r\\nJeremy\\'s recommendations on where to dine and locale of grocery stores and other services was extremely helpful.  We loved Un Bien a short walk away and the street parking was never a problem on 75th.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would return to Ballard without hesitation as Jeremy was an A+ host.  I could not have asked for a better 1st Airbnb experience :-)  The place was bigger than expected!\\r\\nEasy street parking!  When we arrived at Theresa\\'s and CB\\'s house, we met Theresa in the frontyard and she showed us the entrance to our appartement. She took good care of us and made sure we have everything. The appartement was comfy and clean and the bus information on the fridge have been very helpful for the first day.  Theresa & CB were terrific hosts!\\r\\n•And I came in and found a red velvet cupcake waiting for me.\\r\\n•As a  basement apartment, it\\'s basically the same footprint of the house, so pretty spacious.\\r\\n•There was a little bump, which I reported.  They came down IN MINUTES and quickly remedied.\\r\\n•Private enclosed backyard -- with grill – great place to sit & read.\\r\\n•Clear house information was ready & waiting, including for bus --schedules also provided.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighly recommended.\\r\\n CB and Theresa made us feel welcome and were terrific hosts during our stay. The basement unit had everything we needed to enjoy ourselves. Lots of bars, restaurants, and coffee shops nearby and also just far enough to enjoy some peace and quite.  We enjoyed our stay here.  The place was clean, comfortable, and located in an awesome neighborhood.  The location is great - right in the heart of Ballard with plenty to see and do and all within walking distance.  Theresa and CB were great hosts - attentive and responsive throughout our stay.  I would definitely stay again. Theresa and CB did everything to make our stay stress free and comfortable.  The space was clean and welcoming.  Wish we could have stayed more than one night.  The only hiccup was having to duck under an unavoidable air duct (I\\'m 6\\'), which became second nature after doing it a few times.  All in all we had a very nice stay and would totally return. This was a very roomy clean 1 BR apartment. Previous comments with the shallow ceiling  pass through between LR and bed bathroom areas have been addressed.  The apartment was basement but on grade  level.  Very clean. And great \\nconvenience of laundry facilities  and a cute little private yard.      Although we did not get to enjoy it  . Bathroom nice size although a smaller stand up shower then we have had before. We didn\\'t get to meet the owners. But they responded right away via text or phone.   Very recommended for an extended stay in  Ballard .  Cute little house! I loved the advise for local restaurants and coffee shops. We would definitely stay here again.  This was my first experience using AirB&B but it was an easy and pleasant experience, both online and in person.  Everything went\\r\\nperfectly, the key was easy to access, and the apartment was large\\r\\nand perfect for my stay.   It was warm and clean and quiet and they\\r\\neven provided coffee and tea and everything I needed to have\\r\\na wonderful stay.   \\r\\nThank you Theresa and CB, I would certainly stay again. I loved my stay here! Cold and rainy day, nice warm little spot to call home for the weekend. The place has a 1970s, grandma\\'s basement kinda feel, in terms of the basic structure and age of the kitchen, but perfectly maintained, clean, with some modern updates to the furniture, flat screen and internet, of course. I walked in and a carrot muffin greeted me on the counter, welcoming me to the space. There was also coffee and a coffee maker, so I was set for breakfast the next day.  Spacious apartment. Hosts are attentive and provided coffee and cream. Could use some cosmetic work on the interior but it is neat and clean.  Great spacious space! Way bigger than photos show & a full kitchen. It was warm for a basement unit, didn\\'t even use the space heater although it was provided. The bed was crazy comfortable. Walking distance to grocery stores, bars, restaurants, and bus lines. Check in/out was simple. Would definitely stay again! We were very pleased with the apartment.  My daughter flew in from Raleigh to visit us and she said the bed was very comfortable and bragged to her brother that she had the better deal than he had when he visited here. It was rainy during her visit and she mentioned how thoughtful her hosts were to have left her a full size umbrella by the front door for her to use.  An excellent location and hosts who were easy to contact and respond to our questions. Thanks Theresa and CB.  You helped make our holiday visit with our family stress free!!  House was spacious and had a great location. Plenty of off street parking and comfortably slept ten people. Kitchen was fully stocked and free cable and internet. The house is better furnished then the pictures show and includes a small outdoor patio.  Ian and his wife Jeanette were great hosts and I would definitely recommend them in the future. The location was great and the house had everything needed to make our stay comfortable. Two things to note: One was that the description listed 7 beds and there were only 6. This was a bit confusing at first, but Jeanette realized their error and updated the listing. Also, to their defense, I believe the original capacity for 12 people was accurate, just not the number of beds. Second, the house is off the street down a narrow drive. The tenants are not to park there so seemingly there shouldn\\'t be a problem. However, a guest of mine drove in to load up his things to leave and accidentally backed into the neighbors house. While this was a pain for both myself and Ian, Ian and his wife were very gracious and we resolved the issue fairly quickly with Airbnb\\'s help.  Nice house, cool neighborhood. Had everything we needed. I booked this house for a 3 day retreat with a team of 5 co - workers. It was a great venue to collaborate. 5 nice private bedrooms. A couple of kitchens and an outdoor patio with table and barbecue. The house is well stocked with appliances and utensils and everything you need and very clean. A short drive to the center of Ballard. Great experience. We were really happy with the home. The house was as advertised, clean and well furnished.  Street parking was not a problem, just avoid parking under the trees; lots of pitch and bird residue.  Very satisfied, thank you. Ian and Jeanette were great hosts.  The house was spacious and clean and parking was not a problem.  We loved the patio and grill area.  The house is close enough to walk to Ballard and the Locks and it suited our needs perfectly. The house was clean, spacious, and perfect for our needs! Thanks Ian! Communication with the host was perfect.  I had several questions in the planning stages and they were very quick and thorough in responding.  There was a little barking dachshund next door that the neighbors let out in the daytime making it difficult to take a nap.  Otherwise it was all great. The house was fantastic and in a very central area close to local amenities.  Having two seperate self-contained areas was a bonus and street parking was not a problem.  lovely home, lovely hosts.   I was a single traveller for business and stayed for 2 weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\\'t meet Carola but she was always quick to respond and very helpful. The house was lovely and the pictures are accurate it was very clean and well presented.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area is as she says in a neighbourhood/family area so was very quiet at night which was good for me as it was a work trip. Ballard\\'s main shops and bars are around a 15-20min walk away or less than 5mins by bus. It was very close to the number 40 bus line which was convenient for getting to Fremont or Downtown.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\\'t see the neighbour who waters the garden once so it was not a problem at all for me. Didn\\'t use the garden much but it looked very nice with room to sit and have a bbq outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas a really good place to stay for my business trip was cheaper than a hotel and having a cooker, washing machine etc. made the two weeks much nicer. \\r\\n Carola was a great host . Awesome place. Spectacularly convenient. Spotlessly clean. The garden in the back of the house is a wonderful place to relax , it was a wonderful stay in such a beautiful and cozy place  We spent 2 fantastic weeks in Carola\\'s home. The place is lovely, clean and in a quiet area. The garden is a very nice place to relax and have dinner, using the BBQ put at disposal. \\nWe also appreciated Carola\\'s advice regarding the neighborhood and nice places to visit in Seattle.\\nWe highly recommend this home and would be happy to come back in the future for a next visit of the city and its surroundings. My husband and I had a wonderful month long stay in Carola\\'s home while making a move to Seattle. Carola was incredibly responsive, helpful and kind. The home is in a lovely quiet neighborhood close to an assortment of parks, shops and restaurants and is an easy drive downtown. Overall, it is a terrific home away from home that we highly recommend!  Great spot! Comfortable for a stay in ballard. Loved the deck and the BBQ. Walking distance from a QFC and the main drag in Ballard. Upon arrival at the unit, I had a lot of trouble getting the door to unlock. It appears that the doors had swelled and the lock was not working properly. I made several calls to the rental company and eventually with much maneuvering and pounding the lock worked. It was difficult to use throughout my stay. The lock on the back door could not be opened after the first day. The knob was loose and the lock was stuck. I was told that maintenance was going to resolve it. It did not appear to be the case. The unit was much farther from downtown Ballard. Not really walking distance. The neighborhood was nice. The unit was decorated nicely. The bed was comfortable.  I made my reservation the day-of and Sea to Sky was quick to respond, and very easy to deal with. The cottage itself was in a great location, clean, and super cute. I would definitely stay here again! Great little casita in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance from the center of Ballard. Rental required a lot of extra paperwork outside the airbnb system, which surprised me. However, the folks at Sea to Sky were very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again based on the house, but the extra hoops will probably deter me. \\r\\n Perfect accommodation for my trip.  The cottage is comfortable, clean, and private.   Corinne was super nice and helpful despite our late arrival!  The neighborhood was cute, not to mention we loved her beautiful backyard decor.  The downstairs apt was so comfortable and cozy for our short visit.  The art displayed was so cool and interesting it was hard to leave. My wife and I had a great stay in Seattle! Corinne was a fantastic host, super friendly, and introduced us to their very friendly dogs! The basement has access to the entertainment room in the house with great access to kitchen utensils. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bathroom has one of the best showers I have ever seen!  Corinne\\'s cottage was just perfect for our overnight stay in Seattle! We were meeting longtime friends for dinner and did not what a trip home to Whidbey Island to shorten the evening.  Loved the walkable neighborhood, gracious host and comfy bed.  Everything we needed! Amy Corinne was very helpful and welcoming! The place is in a great neighborhood, just a quick walk to everything in Ballard. The house was perfect for 4 and we enjoyed playing the games there and laying on the hammock in the yard. It was a perfect weekend getaway! Corinne and Tom were very good hosts.  They had good recommendations for restaurants and were friendly.  Even though we were in the basement suite, we could not hear them or their dogs.  Comfortable bed, good bathroom and pretty neighbourhood. The house was extremely welcoming and comfortable. Corinne and Tom provided all of the amenities you would find in a hotel, but with a much more comfortable environment. The proximity to dining and activities was also extremely convenient. I would be happy to stay here again!\\n We had a wonderful experience! The accommodations and the hosts were 1st cabin. They communicated promptly, and you could tell they wanted our stay to be as enjoyable as possible. We really enjoyed the back yard, and the hammock is great!The neighborhood is charming and sooooo quiet! I will stay there again.   We had a great stay here. The space was more than acocmodating for the three of us, and Corrine & company were very friendly! I am 6\\'3\" and bumped my head once in the basement through my own fault, but if you are over 6\\'5\" I would recommend looking for another place. Would definitely stay here again!! Ben and I had a nice time at Corinne\\'s. We arrived earlier than expected but got to meet Corinne later in the evening. She\\'s wonderful! Her home is beautiful and the space we stayed in was so cute and homely. Her dogs are adorable and we got to meet them in the morning :). This is just what we needed after camping. Absolutely fantastic experience here. Corinne was incredibly nice, the space was large, clean, and gave access to a lot of amenities that were greatly appreciated. The neighborhood was very quiet and safe. I can\\'t emphasize enough how nice of a place this was. I recommend it 100%. Neighborhood was nice and quiet, a quick walk to Ballard St restaurants and shops. Corrine and Tom have walking maps and city maps available for guests. The space was great, felt like being at home.  Corrine and Tom have it really well set up and provisioned (toiletries in bathroom, coffee, tea, cooking equipment etc).  I would stay here again. Our host was wonderful and so accommodating. It was a great experience.  Much thanks to Corinne.  She\\'s a wonderful host.  So friendly and kind and helpful as we had kids with us to manage as well!  Hope we can stay there again. Super friendly host and great accommodations. Beds are very comfortable and space is clean.  Lots to look at in this eclectic basement apartment.  Excellent location while close to downtown and airport.   Corrine was a lovely hostess, very friendly.  The neighborhood was well maintained and quiet.  It was easily accessed and within walking distance to Ballard downtown.  The main bedroom was very comfortable.  The second bedroom was well furnished.  My family had a very good time there.  We really enjoyed the deck area during the evenings, winding down from the day\\'s adventure.  All in all, I would love to stay there again.  Thank you, Corrine for a nice time in the Seattle area.   Corinne\\'s place was fantastic! My friend and I loved the luxurious queen sized bed with a great duvet. The basement bedroom was also excellent for a sunny summer day as it was quite cool and a great respite from the heat. The bathroom was emmaculate as well and the shower felt like something from a new, modern hotel. We also loved its proximity to great places like Delancey and easy access to bot the D and 40 lines to downtown. Corinne was also an exceedingly nice and accommodating hosts with 3 very adorable dogs. Hey all,\\n\\nWe had an early flight to Seattle and arrived at 8:40am.  Check in wasn\\'t supposed to be till 3pm.  However, Corinne, heartwarming and gracious, allowed us to drop off our bags while we explored the city until we could check in.\\n\\nThe accommodations were splendid and homey.  Remember to keep the tradition of signing her guest book before you part ways from this slice of Seattle Life stay!\\n\\nThanx Corinne!  Corinne was a friendly host, the neighborhood was quiet, the bed was comfy -- everything was great.  Corinne was a great host, she was there to greet us upon arrival and was very welcoming. Instructions for everything was clear and he place was enough for our family of 6 We really liked our stay in Corinne\\'s apartment. He is located in a quiet neighborhood of Seattle not far from Seattle downtown. We found several restaurants close to the house. The apartment is not too big not too small, perfect for a family of 4 like us. It is well decorated. We really like the bedroom and bathroom.\\r\\nWe also appreciate the warm welcome of Corinne when we arrived.  Spacious basement suite with all the amenities you want. We wish we would have had more time to enjoy their cute deck!  Corinne is super welcoming and the place had fine attention to details such as lots of information about the Ballard area and beyond, towels and an assortment of soaps and lotions. The place was well decorated, spacious and clean.  This was the second time my partner had been to Corrine\\'s and she was impressed with the updates to the suite. We would come back when in the area again. Although we arrived late, we felt the warmth and hospitality of Corrine and Tom\\'s home. The space was large and comfortable. Our morning coffee on the deck gave us the perfect start to our morning. Nearby Fat Hen and Honore Bakery were outstanding. This home is in the perfect location and is extremely welcoming. Corinne made us feel welcome from the moment we made our reservation.  The place was great! Hosts were nice. Overall great experience.\\nThanks a lot!  It was an awesome little house-within-a-house.  Private entrance, bedroom, kitchenette, bathroom, living area.  There were so many little touches to make us feel welcome, with hot chocolate and oatmeal packets in addition to the coffee and tea, and chocolate mints on the pillows.  The bed was so comfortable it was hard to leave in the morning.  And Corinne and Tom were awesome hosts.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir place was also a really short walk from shops and restaurants.  We had a great night getting a few drinks at Kickin\\' Boot, taking a walk around the rest of the Ballard strip, and then returning for more awesome food at Kickin\\' Boot. Lovely location; close to market, shops, transportation, restaurants\\r\\ngreat accommodations-lots of space, very quiet\\r\\nLoved the coffee, chocolate, fluffy towels, and great bath products! The place was perfect for 5 of us. All the beds were comfortable. It is a beautiful downstairs area. Tons of decorations and stuff that makes you feel like you are at home. It was a good location for us, 1.5 miles from Golden Gate park. They even left cute little chocolates on our pillows. :)  We were so pleased with Corinne & Tom\\'s little basement apartment.  It\\'s incredibly charming and welcoming and suited our needs perfectly.  We only stayed one night, but would stay again in a heartbeat.  And, we would definitely recommend this place to anyone we know staying in Seattle.  Thanks, Corinne & Tom! The neighborhood was quiet and the space was comfy. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom had everything you could need. The hosts were very friendly and communication was clear.  Surprised Corinne and Tom a little early upon arrival and they were very nice about it.  The neighborhood is beautiful, a short walk from public transportation and a few mins drive from downtown. They were very friendly, accommodating, and helpful with advice about where to go for fun and good food. Their place was clean, comfy and felt just like home. Highly recommended!  This was a very warm and cozy room, house and neighborhood all together. We arrived much later than we had expected and unfortunately were unable to meet the hosts, but once we arrived instantly felt comfortable. Corinne and Tom were very welcoming. The neighborhood was very quiet as were the cute little dogs. My daughter and I thought that the master bed was so comfortable and the three children seemed comfortable enough also in the media room. The space was very clean and the yard was also a nice treat. Staying in this basement apartment was great! Corinne and Tom are so hospitable and accommodating--any little thing you can possibly think of to need during your stay is available. My cousin and I stayed for a long weekend and while we were pretty much there just to sleep and shower, the place would have been great for much more than that. I felt safe and the location was great--it truly felt like a home away from home! This was our second stay at this location and again it was great. Corinne was very helpful in providing recommendations for nearby dining, shopping and everything anyone could ask for during their stay. Location was just a short distance from most of the main attractions that we were looking to visit. This place is absolutely fantastic and I would absolutely recommend it. We felt very welcome and comfy. The hosts are very nice people with some incredibly cute dogs. Thank you Corinne & Tom! Good position in Seattle.but not good experince in here.the hosts visited our place everyday in order to clean but invade your privacy .the roof is too low to touch your head.power is not enough. Corinne welcomed us upon arrival and walked us through the accommodations which were spacious and quiet. Excellent orientation and extremely welcoming. Very homey with personal & thoughtful touches - books, games, maps, etc.  Comfortable bed and pillows so we slept great. Cute residential neighborhood is safe and easy to walk around, including at night,  to shops and restaurants. Close and easy access to bus lines which we used to go to downtown Seattle.  Terrific location. A lovely home with gracious hosts! This was our first Airbnb and it was fantastic.\\r\\nWe were running late and Corrine had no problems accommodating us, when we arrived she greeted us and was very friendly. She gave us great info on restaurants in the area and sightseeing advice. \\r\\nStaying here was like staying at a friend\\'s house, clean and comfortable with coffee, tea , cocoa and oatmeal. There was plenty of room for the three of us and although the ceilings are a bit low as mentioned i had no problems (I\\'m 6\\') and plenty of clearance and the place was very spacious.\\r\\nWas only a few minutes drive from Pikes Place and Space Needle, and there are places to eat and stores only blocks away.\\r\\nWish we could have stayed longer and will absolutely stay here again.\\r\\nThanks  for everything Corinne\\r\\n Really nice, spacious, comfortable basement apartment; hosts were really friendly and accommodating. Corinne was very accommodating and made me, as well as my daughter comfortable right away. The apartment was just what I needed for a couple of nights while I was in Seattle. Much attention was paid to detail when preparing this space. I\\'d happily stay here again. This was a great space in a basement apartment, perfect for the weekend stay. Corinne and Tom were always available in person or by text and very responsive, which was so helpful. They were great with a last minute change to the reservation, gave us detailed tours of the space, and always with a ready smile. My 6\\' friend was fine in the space, just had to duck a little for the heating ducts but he didn\\'t mind at all. I would recommend this space and this host to others. By the way, the media room was an entirely separate room with a really comfortable convertible couch and a door that closes for privacy. My friend said the couch/bed was very comfortable to sleep on. The media room and the bedroom run parallel to each other with a common wall between the two. Staying at Corinne & Tom\\'s was great! They really did everything to make us feel comfortable and they gave us excellent recommendations when we didn\\'t know where to go. Their place feels like home and if we could stay there again, we definitely would. They are both very nice and they made sure we we\\'re comfortable and had everything we needed. They are very detail-oriented and put a lot of thought into the rooms. There we\\'re plenty of board games to keep us entertained on rainy nights and their coffee/French press was invaluable. Everything was perfect, you couldn\\'t ask for better hosts.  It\\'s such a comfortable place to stay, make us feel like just at home.\\r\\nCorinne and Tom have been very nice and helpful.  We got nice advices from Corinne about our tour plan.  We really loved our Air Bnb experience, we find a smart choice for our travel. Corinne and Tom were so warm, friendly, helpful and welcoming the entire stay! Tom even helped us bring our bags in and my sleeping son in his stroller down to the apt. The apt. is fantastic and both bedrooms are wonderful spaces! The chocolates, cookies and selection of teas and oatmeal were such a sweet touch!  Ballard is a wonderful neighbourhood and their home is in a great spot!  The house hosts, Corinne and Tom, are friendly and thoughtful. They made me feel relieved with my first experience of Airbnb. We arrived quite late (10pm) but Tom still happily gave us the tour and  got us settled in.  After a Super 8 the night before we were happy for the extra space, cleanliness and security.  There really was ample space for the 4 of us and our many suitcases.  We were only in town for 3 nights and 2 full days so were out all day sight-seeing and came back late at night to sleep.  The bed was very comfortable and the heated blanket kept us toasty warm.  Tom was very kind to let us park in the driveway the night before we left and Corrine was very quick with communication prior to the trip and helping us out with suggestions and ideas. I only wish we had a chance to spend a little bit of time catching up, but were like ships in the night as we were so busy.  This was our first AirBnB experience and it was a great one.  We would have no hesitation in recommending you stay with Corinne & Tom if you are heading to Seattle. Thanks guys for your hospitality.   Great location in Ballard close to Fremont and the breweries there, which was very convenient for our needs. Really cool rental with lots of space that is well decorated and equipped. This was a great place to stay. Corinne responded to my request quickly and with just 1 day notice and was very accommodating. Upon arrival Tom came to greet us and gave us a quick tour. The place was very clean, the coffee and tea were very appreciated and I would definitely return. There was a list of recommended restaurants, breweries, etc in the city and neighborhood which was great-we used these and had a really good dinner as a result. Overall great space and great hosts!  What a great stay. Perfect for what we needed! Tom and Corinne are super friendly and gave us plenty of privacy. Thanks a bunch!  I only saw Tom briefly, but Corinne was extremely helpful and courteous to me during my entire visit. I couldn\\'t have asked for a nicer hostess. The neighborhood was very walkable with plenty of places to eat. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe rooms are quite large and nicely appointed. I enjoyed staying in them. Everything was very clean. The wifi was top notch. The bed was so comfy I had a hard time getting out of it. The place definitely has that basement feel to it though, with low ceilings, little natural light, uneven heating and minimal sound insulation, so that\\'s something to consider if those things are an issue for you. Also, the kitchenette is better for preparing snacks than meals, and there is no table suitable for dining, so I would recommend planning to eat out for major meals.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall I thought this was a great value with so much space and privacy. I had a wonderful stay, and would recommend it for those that enjoy nicely furnished basements. Corrine was a fabulous host. There was so much to do and so much thought and detail gone into every aspect of our accommodation. From detailed tourist destinations to netflicks - we truly enjoyed our stay in Seattle. Corrine was great fun to talk to and genuinely intereted in us and did her best to make our time in Seattle the best possible :-) I\\'d stay here again in a heart beat. The place was great. Corinne was very nice and showed us around the place. There were lots of board games and movies available to use. I would definitely stay there again.  This place was perfect!  Corrine was an awesome host and the neighbor hood was so cute.  We had a great time and were within walking distance of everything we needed.   Just enjoyed my 2nd stay with Corinne and Tom. There is no greater compliment than a repeat lodger!  :-) Two large comfy rooms and spaces to sit and chat. Both rooms have a heater and the bed in the bedroom has a heating blanket, too. I love that they continue to make small improvements to the place to make it more comfy for those who are staying here. Thanks again! We had a wonderful stay with Tom and Corinne! The room was even better than advertised. The bed was cozy and comfortable, we loved the little touches like having tea and almond milk available, and the rain shower in the bathroom was great! PArking was easy and the Ballard location was close to lots of restaurants and shops. We would definitely stay here again! This place was awesome! Chocolates on the pillows, delicious pastries for snacks, and an all around cute atmosphere We had such a pleasant stay here! Everything was clean and cozy. The decorations were quirky, beds were heavenly, and we had all the \"extras\" we needed. The host introduced herself but gave us our privacy. We would definitely stay here again if we needed a place in Seattle.  The space was very comfortable and clean and Corinne was very kind. We arrived pretty late, but she gave us instructions on how to get in and it was very easy. The apartment was really cute and had everything we needed for our stay. We would absolutely stay here again!  Tom and Corinne were extremely hospitable - our stay with them exceeded our expectations based on their listing. Corinne was happy to give us recommendations on what to do in the city, and there was so much thought put into every little detail of the bedroom + common area to make our stay as comfortable as possible.  We stayed with Corrine and Tom for three weeks while visiting our granddaughter who was due to have a baby. Corrine and Tom were very accommodating during our stay. They even worked with us to make two separate bookings since we would be making a short trip to Idaho in the middle of the three week stay. This way we didn\\'t have to pay for the days we weren\\'t there. They even stored some of our luggage in the meantime. The rooms are perfect. Very nice and clean. They have a beautiful home and have stocked the guest area with all kinds of things to keep you entertained. The low ceilings weren\\'t really an issue even with me being 6 feet tall. We visited several times with Corrine and very much enjoyed our conversations. I would highly recommend this air bnb and would stay here again. Thank you Corrine and Tome for your hospitality.  Corinne greeted us and gave a nice overview of the rooms. It worked out perfect for our family and the neighborhood was awesome. Would gladly stay with them again. Outstanding stay We were very pleased with our stay at Tom and Corinne\\'s place.  Corinne was very welcoming and accommodating.  The description was accurate and the place very comfortable.  We would stay again! Corinne\\'s and Tom\\'s  place is everything and more they say it is. They have thought about every little imaginable and unimaginable detail to make their guests feel comfortable. We felt relaxed, had enough privacy and slept like babies :)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is nice and quiet, and theres a bus to the \\'city\\' within 2 minutes walk. Plenty of parking place.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will definitely stay at Corinne\\'s and Tom\\'s next time we\\'re in Seattle, highly recommended!  Corinne and Tom made our stay in Seattle convenient and comfortable. Their place is very homey and they put a lot of thought and care into setting up their airbnb listing and we really appreciated it. We would definitely come back if we\\'re in the area again! The accommodations were spacious, clean and had great amenities.  The Ballard location was great. We really enjoyed our stay at Tom and Corinne\\'s.  Before arriving, I was concerned the accommodation would not be spacious enough for 4 guests, but it definitely was. Very private, the bathroom is spacious. The kitchen area has everything you need for your stay.  the location is not far from downtown. We took the light rail from the airport, and from there we took a taxi, it was about $23 to Corinne\\'s place. We used public transportion back into downtown. There is a car rental place only 5 minute walk from Corinne\\'s which we needed to go to Mt. Rainier. I would recommend you stay here. I really liked the basement feel to it.  Thank you Corinne for your hospitality.  An all-round fantastic Airbnb. Corinne was great and made our short stay as pleasant as possible. The house is located in a quiet residential neighbourhood, walking distance to loads of trendy bars, restaurants and shops. A great introduction to Seattle, would definitely recommend. This particular photo is SOOOO Misleading!  The room looks a tad small and a little 1980, but that is not the case at all!  There are two wonderfully sized, independent, clean, comfortable bedrooms.  Everything is up to date and there are generous amenities including plenty of outlets, bedside lights, all kitchenette necessities from cutting board to compost trash, and a great reading selection.  The bathroom had everything from a hairdryer to fluffy towels to a deluxe shower head.  The hosts were friendly and non intrusive.  Tom met us as we arrived and gave us a perfect tour of the space and the amenities including \"Here\\'s how to use the media center\". The private coded entry made for easy access.  The dogs made a bit of noise from time to time, but nothing unmanageable.  As someone who is afraid of dogs I felt fine the entire time.  Easy communication before and during the stay including modifying our arrival time since we got distracted in downtown and didn\\'t get to the house till later in the afternoon.  And amazingly convenient location including parking.  Even with it being a busy weekend in Seattle we were able to get to Capitol Hill and downtown within minutes by car as well as the shore.  We were about 10 minutes from a 24 Hour fitness, 5 minutes from a Walgreen\\'s and grocery, great diverse neighborhood for walking.  Though Ballard itself seemed a bit more Caucasian hipster than the rest of Seattle, as two women of color we felt safe and accepted walking around, joining karaoke, and watching the Women\\'s World Cup wit the locals.   Corinne and Tom were excellent hosts. They made us feel very welcome by providing tea and chocolate! The neighborhood was quiet and close to our destinations in the city. The space was clean and spacious, and easy to park and enter/exit. It was truly ideal for my sister\\'s bachelorette party, and I would highly recommend you stay with Corinne and Tom.  We loved loved loved our experience in Seattle and it was made even better staying with our hosts Corinne and Tom! Corinne was very sweet and it was nice to meet our hosts since I usually do not. She was really welcoming and gave us many suggestions and recommendations. The neighborhood was very safe and residential. The pictures should be updated since the place is even better looking now. The pictures don\\'t do it justice, it really is swanky! There are so many little details and decor that made the place feel welcoming and cozy. It was very spacious and entertaining. Corinne gave us a nice tour of the place and explained where everything is. She has a few set of rules and you have to pay to use the washer and dryer. The bathroom was clean and had all the amenities a hotel would have plus a homey feel. Next time I visit Seattle, I will be staying with Corinne and Tom. I had a lengthy stay with Tom and Corinne along with 2 other friends. It was absolutely brilliant. They are very friendly and welcoming and helpful in all manner of ways from assisting with bags to telling about the local area and what was on at the time. \\r\\nThe unit is very comfortable with large airy rooms. No kitchen as such but we had microwave, fridge, toaster, kettle and coffee pot. Laundry facilites are available  The TV is basic, no cable but netflix is available as well as wireless internet. There is plenty of parking in the drive way and street. A fenced back yard and back porch to sit if desired. We did not make use of this but could have. I would definitely stay again if I was back in Seattle. Its a pretty central location with easy access to down town and other important tourist places :):).  Corinne\\'s place is awesome! It\\'s comfortable and clean. Very spacious even though I\\'m traveling with three other adults and a two-year old. It\\'s conveniently located so close to everything. Corinne checks in with us often to make sure if we\\'ve got everything we need. We definitely recommend this place! Wir waren sehr zufrieden. Corinne war sehr freundlich. Saubere Räume und freundliche Atmosphäre. Gerne wieder. This place was amazing.  It\\'s pretty huge and accommodated my entire crew (6 people, one infant) and had room to spare.  Very comfy. It was easy to find and right in the middle of where we needed to be.  I loved being able to have access to the back yard to relax.  The hosts were more than awesome.  I didn\\'t get to meet Corinne in person, but she was amazing at dealing with me trying to book this place and changing my mind a million times!!  I would book again when I go back to Seattle.   Corinne greeted us on our arrival and showed us the living quarters covering all the particulars regarding the TV,  coffeemaker, hot plate, and the location of the kitchen essentials.  She encouraged us to either knock on her door or call her or Tom anytime with any questions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe listing was accurate and certainly lived up to our expectations.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is safe and tidy.  Ample on-street parking.   Public transportation is also within easy walking distance.  We primarily chose the location because it was within a mile of our daughter\\'s home.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou won\\'t be disappointed if you decide to stay with Corinne & Tom. Corinne and Tom were very welcoming and considerate hosts. They took the time to set our beds and walk us through the place. It was a great setup and most things that you need as a visitor was pretty much provided. If you forget something no worries they have most things in stock, hence an iron and blow dryer. \\n\\nFor those of you who are dog lovers; they have a few dogs in the home above the guest rooms; which felt pretty relaxing because when they barked I know the place is safe. \\n\\nOverall, Corinne and Tom made a great pair of hosts. We definitely felt comfortable staying at their home. \\n\\nThank you for having us stay at your awesome home. We enjoyed our stay.  The listing was accurate and the neighborhood was delightful.  Tom helped me in with my bags and we quickly settled in for our second stay with Corinne & Tom.  The two spacious rooms provided the privacy that my daughter and I required.  We will definitely stay with them again on future trips to Seattle. The hosts were very communicative and welcoming. The apartment is fabulous. It is very spacious and comfortable, with everything my family needed for a weeklong stay. We loved the personal touches and amenities. The location is perfect and easy to get to using public transportation. The neighborhood is not only safe and clean, but also quaint and peaceful. There were a lot of dining options with walking distance, and a short bus ride takes you to downtown Ballard. I definitely recommend a stay. Corinne and Tom\\'s cute and LARGE basement apartment was charming, and absolutely wonderful for a stay to visit family in Seattle! Decor was quirky and something I wish I could reproduce at home. Great amenities and special touches like DVD collection for the kiddies. I slept like a baby in the master bedroom and was so much better than a tiny hotel room. Corinne and Tom have made me a convert to AirBNB - I will be back! Corinne and Tom have been splendid hosts, helping us feel comfortable and offering advice when we asked for it. The apartment is extremely cozy, a great place for a get-away from one\\'s busy lifestyle. And is even equipped with all sorts of games and shows to entertain yourself even if you feel like staying in/it\\'s raining. My group of 6 felt that the apartment was a just nice fit for us but an additional person would have been a little tight. Overall, loved the apartment and would love to visit again! Corinne and Tom are the perfect hosts: accessible but not intrusive. Their apartment is very clean, comfortable, and well-lit, with both overhead and task lighting options in every area (not always the case in basement apartments).The neighborhood is very safe, suits my needs well, and is as others have described. An added plus for me was the wealth of information about Seattle and environs they provide: published guidebooks, attraction brochures, bus and ferry schedules, restaurant menus, and Corinne and Tom\\'s own self-produced restaurant guide with wonderful annotations about what makes each place special. I hope there\\'ll be space available every time I visit my daughter in Seattle! My plans changed quite a bit during my trip but Corinne and Tom were very accommodating! I unfortunately didn\\'t get the chance to meet them, but their place was amazing! Lots of room, nice and quiet, and great location. They had everything you would need for your stay, including tons of travel brochures for things to do around Seattle. I would definitely stay here again! Upon arrival Tom met my friends and I outside and gave us a detailed tour of the place. The place was beautiful, even better than the pictures! The neighborhood was lovely and not far from downtown. We really enjoyed our stay. Corinne & Tom were great! We were able to easily find the place and let ourselves in and it was all ready for our arrival. They were super friendly and helpful and the place was perfect for our stay. Would love to stay again if we found ourselves in the area again! Corinne and Tom were perfect hosts, very welcoming and accommodating. Their apartment is full of interesting objects and was spotlessly clean. Very comfy beds and high quality bed and bath linen. There are limited cooking facilities but this wasn\\'t an issue for us. We loved the supply of fresh coffee beans too! Very welcoming experience, attention to detail, helpful about our experience in the area, traffic, places to eat, etc.   Corinne and Tom made me feel so welcome! They were so kind and helpful and thought of everything we could have needed. Having not spent much time in Seattle the Ballard neighborhood is so much fun and has so many things to do. The space was great and better than I could have expected. Everything was wonderful!  Morgan\\'s home is beautifully furnished, and one step inside has you feeling as comfortable as if you\\'d been living there for years. You\\'ll be staying in a very nice room complete with a cozy loveseat and enormous television (with clear instructions on how to use it), in addition to the twin sized bed. Morgan\\'s attention to detail is what made my stay a pleasant one. Anything I could\\'ve asked for was already taken care of and waiting. Your time at Morgan\\'s home will be enjoyable. Morgan met me at the door and introduced herself and her super sweet dog, Maisy. They were both very kind. Morgan was very pleasant and  I felt I had a lot of privacy in the house. \\r\\nThe room is super cute decorated with such curious flare. Colour and patterns that I would never dream of putting together just  look awesome and it makes the room very special. \\r\\nThe lighting in the room is soft and dramatic. An amazing wood carved screen is placed tastefully in front of a lamp and it casts such a warm subtle light in the room.\\r\\nThe room also had some neat looking antique trinkets which add a lot of charm. It\\'s not a huge room but it does have a big comfy chair to sit in and is way more cosy than a hotel room. \\r\\nThe bed was very comfortable and the fact that the room had two windows (a first for me for a bedroom) made it very refreshing with the cool summer air whispering in. \\r\\nI would love to stay there again if I travel again to Seattle.  I really enjoyed staying in Morgan\\'s house. It\\'s beautiful, I would have appreciated to have more time to enjoy the garden. The room is perfect, with everything you need. \\r\\nThe neighborhood is quiet, but you\\'re not so far from Ballard so you can go out not so far from the room. \\r\\nAnd above all, Maisie is great to feel comfortable with!  Morgan was quick to respond and easy to reach. Her space was as she represented it to be. It was easy to stay and to come bs go. It was a great neighborhood to be in, as well. The Heart Home! Morgan and Mazie Dogg are very warm and welcoming hosts in a warm and welcoming home. The house is a quiet neighborhood and an easy walk to parks and a longer walk to Golden Gardens park. I would stay here again in the beat of a heart.  What a great airbnb experience! Morgan was very helpful in regards to recommending cute shops/places to eat in and around Ballard and her and her adorable dog Maisie were very welcoming. The house and room itself has a very warm, homey vibe and Morgan even has coffee/tea available for guests in the morning. As a travelling nurse, I had a more extended stay and Morgan was extremely accommodating. When I come back to Seattle, I would love to stay with her again! Glad to say I not only had a nice place to stay but also gained a new friend :)  Staying at Morgan\\'s house was so comfortable that I booked with her a second time. Morgan is such a warm and helpful person. I felt at home in her house right away. Not to mention the bed is super comfy!! I slept great there. Also, her house is in a great location, I walked pretty easily into Ballard most nights to grab a bite to eat at the fun restaurants there. I definitely recommend staying at Morgan\\'s place, especially if you\\'re traveling alone and want a comfortable retreat to come back to! Morgan and the pup were amazing hosts. Falling asleep in that cozy bedroom with the sound of rain out the open window lead to one of the bests night\\'s sleep in a while. Highly recommend! Staying with Morgan was the highlight of my trip to Seattle. It actually felt more like what I expect to experience at a regular bed and breakfast, namely having wonderful conversations with the hosts. Morgan was a totally engaged hostess and wonderful person. The accommodations were better than advertised, and I felt totally at home during my stay.  Morgan\\'s place felt very cozy. She was very nice as well as her little dog. I rented a car and was able to park it on the street with no problem. Bed was very comfortable and the area was fairly quiet. Overall, it was a very nice experience.  Very gracious hostess.  Welcomed me after a long day in class.  Gave me the bare necessities and left me on my own.  Just exactly what I needed.  Well appointed room.  Very nice house.  Bed was a little short for me, but I\\'m 6\\'4\" and short beds are nothing new.  Would stay there again. My dog Jack and I had a wonderful stay with Morgan and Maisey. I felt right at home, as if staying with an old friend. The room is clean, comfortable and very well thought out. Morgan is thoughtful, considerate and very friendly. You will have everything you need and more. I highly recommend Morgan\\'s place and would absolutely stay again. Thank you Morgan and Maisey! Morgan was a wonderful host, ready with suggestions, a little reference book in the room for local eateries, bus schedules around town, etc.  The room was cozy and welcoming, with a snack basket available, toiletries and coffee and tea in the kitchen.  The bed was so comfortable I would have taken it home with me!  I highly recommend this location for your next stay in Seattle and it certainly felt like home to me! Great location with an easy walk to downtown Ballard. Room was right next to bathroom and provided plenty of space to spread out. Morgan got a new bed while I was there and upgraded the room for free while I was out one night, coming home to a comfy new bed. I\\'d recommend this to anyone looking to enjoy the Ballard community. Perfect. Would stay every time I\\'m in Seattle nice place From the first steps into the house, this was a most wonderful experience. The room is an oasis, the bed...well I wish the one at my home was as comfortable! The Heart House certainly lives up to the name. Located in a quiet area yet within easy access to shops and restaurants. Morgan and sweet Maisy make you feel so welcome. So nice to open the door and be greeted by them both! My first time with airbnb and I really hope I have an opportunity to stay with Morgan and Maisy again.  This guest house is perfect for a weekend trip or an extended stay. The first floor bedroom is comfortable and quite with a large closet and washer/dryer. The second floor has a small (but very well equipped) kitchen, a full bathroom and large living area space (including TV and WiFi). The skylights all along the ceiling add bright natural light during the day and make it a great spot to spend some time in the morning before heading out. The guest house has a separate entrance from the back of the property and a parking spot, so access was a breeze. \\r\\n\\r\\nI live in the Loyal Heights neighborhood and can attest to the great location of this guest house (quiet neighborhood that is very convenient to Ballard and an easy trip to downtown). My parents came to visit for an extended stay and really loved the guest house. Considering the quality of the nearby hotels and how expensive the nice ones are this place is a steal. You get a lot of living space for a reasonable rate. Finally, Kassy was very responsive to the questions we had and was easy to work with. We will definitely be using this guest house in the future.  A vase of tulips greeted me as I entered the kitchen area, along with a note welcoming me and indicating that if I had any questions to contact Kassy by texting her.  Also a nice package of coffee was on the table.  The neighborhood was great.  It was quiet and peaceful.  The interior was immaculate and very cozy.  The bed was comfortable and the shower was very good.  I moved around the kitchen with ease, making myself completely at home.  I had an excellent stay.     Kassy\\'s guest house is beautiful. We kept commenting on how nice everything was. The bed was comfortable, the shower and bathroom were very nice. There is plenty of light and the sky lights with the trees above them made the ambience that much better. She had coffee ready for us and creamer in the refrigerator. She also was easy to get in touch with and would answer my questions in a very timely manner. \\r\\nWe loved the location and it was convenient having our own parking place. I would highly recommend this location for anyone with a car for transportation (we didn\\'t use public transportation; it seems that this location would not be ideal for that).   This property was fantastic. The neighborhood was quiet and not too far from downtown. There was more than enough room, the TV\\'s were massive, the bed was extremely comfy, and I was completely undisturbed which allowed me to work in peace in the evenings. There was coffee and cold creamer available, soap/shampoo/conditioner in the shower, fluffy towels, and a dedicated parking space. Definitely would recommend to others and will definitely try and stay here again in the future. We had a great week long stay at Kassy\\'s place in Loyal Heights. Very well set-up and good use of space. Skylights add good natural light.  Love the location off a quiet laneway in Loyal Heights. Kassy was very welcoming and responsive during our stay. Would happily recommend to others. \\r\\nOur stay at the guest house was delightful. Eventhough it was warmer than usual in Seattle, we were pleased to find the house cool, with fans already running - upon our arrival.\\r\\nThe location is ideal for morning walks! The neighborhood is quiet and a park overlooking the water is less than 10 minutes away. \\r\\nHaving an off road reserved parking spot was a big bonus! Nice place, good communication  The guest house is beautiful. Everything was new and very clean and the neighborhood was nice. A beautiful park where you can watch the sunset, a cafe, and a good bakery are all within walking distance.  The house was very comfortable, quiet, and private.  Towels and sheets were provided and there were some basic toiletries (pump bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash) which is a huge plus if you\\'re traveling with carry on luggage only.  Fabulous house, absolutely immaculate. Kassy was very helpful with everything and a great location for our holiday. \\r\\nThanks again, we had a great time.\\r\\nCaroline We had a great stay in the guest house. It was very clean and beautiful. Close to my sons home who we had come to visit. Would recommend this to everyone! Thank you! I would absolutely recommend staying here! Check in was very easy and communicating with Kassy was so easy as well. The place is very nice, we wanted for nothing. Very accessible to all Ballard had to offer, and we actually found it very easy to take the bus downtown from here as well (the bus stop is only about 8 min walk).  We spent 1 night at the guest house and we were very happy with our stay. Kassy was very responsive and helpful. The guest house is private and well equipped. We were able to walk to a cafe and then explore Golden Gardens park in the morning. We would definitely stay there again. I enjoyed my stay at this guest house. It was very clean and having a washer and dryer to use was super! The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped.  We spend one night at this beautiful guesthouse. It is in perfect condition and we will definitely come back when we return to Seattle.  Loyal Heights Guest House is a delightful place!  Kassy was wonderful to work with - she responded quickly to all our questions and kept us apprised throughout the process.  The house is spotless and beautifully maintained.  Kassy was a great host and we will definitely be staying at Loyal Heights Guest House on our next visit to Seattle.   We loved this cozy and clean guesthouse! There is nothing better than coming into town after a 12 hour drive arriving to a bed with high thread count sheets. Luxury! Would highly recommend Kassy\\'s guest house  Kassy\\'s guest house was perfect for my husband and I while we were in Seattle! It was clean, modern, and the perfect size! All appliances and amenities seemed new and everything was exactly as Kassy described. The neighborhood was very quiet and close to Golden Gardens Park, which was exactly what we were looking for. Kassy was always quick to respond and she provided all necessary details without being asked. Overall, we loved staying here and even said we wish Kassy could come decorate our home!  Staying at the Loyal Heights Guest House was a wonderful experience!!  This was our first time using Airbnb and the process worked beautifully.  Kassy quickly responded to all our questions throughout the process.  We LOVED the house and location.  The home is spotless and maintained beautifully.  (There\\'s even a washer and dryer!).  We couldn\\'t have asked for a better experience and the Loyal Heights Guest House will definitely be our home-away-from-home in the future!! We had a great experience.  The guest house was very clean and comfortable,  and was well maintained.  Kassy was very helpful and supportive but very respectful of our privacy.  She even helped me map out a beautiful run this morning.  This was our first time using air  b and b and it was a very positive experience! Kassy was an ideal host - immediately responding to any and all of my inane questions about the process (this was my first booking), and the house itself is a perfect respite in an unbelievably cool area of the city.   This will be my first stop every time i return to Seattle. Very convenient n well kept  We loved this place! It is more beautiful than the pictures show with every detail well thought out. Everything is very luxurious from the towels, blankets and sheets to the very complete kitchen with dishes, glasses, silverware and appliances. My husband said the downstairs bedroom was a perfect nest for rest and relaxation. The storage closet with laundry machines was perfect to keep all of our luggage out of the way. The location was perfect for us and very quiet with parking included. We walked to several local parks and coffee shops.  Sunset Hill Park is only 5 or 6 blocks away and has a beautiful view of the Sound for enjoying sunsets. Golden Gardens Park with a nice sandy beach is only a little over a mile hike  (hike because of the winding path and 100 or so steps down over the cliff)\\r\\nWe did get a quick chance to meet Kassy and she was very warm and welcoming. We were coming from another vacation rental with groceries and she had no problem with letting us drop them off in the refrigerator before check-in time. We really aprreciated this and the chance to meet her. We had absolutely no other need to contact her during our stay. Also, all other communication prior to our visit was quick and helpful\\r\\nWe will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Ballard visiting relatives. The price is more than fair for how beautifully done this guest house is. Thanks Kassy! The place was fantastic! Directions were right on, and everything was as described: a cozy and cute 2-floor guest house with parking. We very much appreciated our space, and with the fence between the guest house and the main house, had complete privacy. Everything was clean and comfortable, and the cable TV was great for downtime. Loved our time here in Seattle and in the neighborhood, and Kassy\\'s listing was perfect for a quiet stay. The apartment was lovely and very comfortable.  It was spotlessly clean.  It had everything we needed, including a comfortable bed, luxurious sheets and towels and a washer-dryer.  The neighborhood was very quiet and convenient to Ballard and Golden Gardens Park. We absolutely loved this place. It is our favorite Airbnb experience to date. The pictures really don\\'t do this place justice. Super clean and the host was responsive and courteous. You will love this place! Kassy was very prompt and friendly with all correspondence.  She gave clear detailed information about how to find her cottage and where to park.  The cottage was exactly as described and even better.  It was very clean, fresh, new and comfortable and very private and quiet.  Kitchen was well equipped.  There is allot of natural light in the upstairs living area with 5 skylights with beautiful trees above. We had some very busy days and found the cottage to be a quiet retreat. The neighborhood was lovely with beautiful old homes. one evening we walked down to sunset park with a fabulous view of the water and harbor.  Another day we took a nice walk to golden garden park, it was a good hike back up but very doable, We felt \\r\\nvery lucky to have found Kassys\\' cottage and \\r\\nwill definitely book her place again if we are in the area.    The rental was clean, quiet, warm, and inviting.  Ballard is a great neighborhood to explore.  We will definitely rent again! This was our first time using Airbnb.  Kassy helped answer all of our questions and guided us through the process. My family and I had a great experience in the Loyal Heights Guest House. The setup was perfect as it allowed for plenty of space for a family of four during a three day stay. The amenities were great and as described.  The bed in the lower level is fantastic; this provided restful sleep after a day\\'s activities.    The guest house itself is immaculate, like Martha Stewart just breezed through.  The location provided easy access to activities in Seattle and beyond.   This site was great and we would use again when in the area.  The Loyal Heights Guest House was PERFECT!  It\\'s quiet, cozy and super clean. Kassy is the most gracious hostess. She responds quickly to questions and keeps the guest house stocked with fluffy towels, fantastic new bedding and everything you need in the kitchen.  The house is ideally located in north Ballard in a quiet neighborhood with access to great Ballard shopping and restaurants. We will absolutely stay again. Kassy\\'s Guest House worked very well as a home base for our family of four while having some remodeling completed on our house (which is five minutes away).  The guest house is very clean, well maintained, and includes all the comforts of home.  \\r\\n\\r\\nKassy was a gracious and responsive host, and even dropped off several items (that we inadvertently left) at our house afterwards.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, highly recommended and we will likely use Kassy\\'s guest house in the future for when family visits from out of town. Kassy\\'s Guest House was perfect for us as our daughter lives nearby in Ballard.  It was a nice 30 minute walk for us.  The apartment was very clean, comfortable and well equipped for our stay.   Great place, excellent communication! It is a lovely home with a nice outdoor area to sit and enjoy the fresh air. There is plenty of street parking available around the home. The location is convenient to get downtown or to Shilshole or the north end. Lots of great hole-in-the-wall restaurants in the area as well as larger establishments. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe basement area has 1 bedroom with a soft queen bed with a curtain dividing it from the living area. There is a fun air hockey table, a daybed, couch, table, 3/4 bathroom (shower, toilet, sink) and a washer and dryer. There is also a microwave and small refrigerator. \\r\\n\\r\\nCorbin and her family are very friendly and accommodating to their guests. They pretty much gave us keys and left us alone.  We were there at the height of an unusually hot and humid summer leaving the basement on the damp side. A de-humidifier would help the basement in general.  There are ultrasonic pest units plugged into the walls, but Seattle has a lot of bugs and being a basement space, you can expect to find spiders and pillbugs. Nothing horrifying, but just keep that in mind if you are not used to that. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur stay was quiet, comfortable and convenient. We would definitely stay there again if we returned to the same area.  Corbin (and family) made us feel very welcome and made arrival easy. Very helpful and generous with easy access to all facilities listed in the description. The place was very comfortable and certainly lived up to expectation. The outdoor decking was a fine spot for a quiet drink and a read. Location was excellent, Ballard is a great neighbourhood to explore and access to Seattle centre was straight forward.\\r\\n Corbin made us feel very welcome! She was warm, easy going and gave us good advice about what to do in Seattle. Although Ballard is not in the center of the city, it is a great neighborhood to explore.  This was my first AirBnB experience and all went very smoothly. Corbin was a kind and welcoming host, and very responsive in our communication. The space was comfortable, had everything we needed and was in a prime location for exploring Ballard/North Seattle. Lovely flat.  Neat, tidy, authentic. Public transportation nearby, but not close (7-8 blocks). Good, quiet neighborhood, great farmer\\'s market. Sadly, the independent bookstore Epilogue is no more. If you are a independent traveler and can share a kitchen, you will enjoy your stay here. Thanks Al for sharing that yummy Pinot Gris and for the special deal. Al is a very trusting and down to earth individual - proved when he handed the keys over to me and my colleague to essentially \"house sit\" while he and his daughter headed out of town to the Oregon Country Fair.  This generosity seems hard to come by this day and age, so it came as a breath of fresh air.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if you are an individual who is used to a very clean living space - like myself - Al\\'s home may not be the one for you. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe hardwood floors appeared to have gone unswept for quite sometime\\r\\nThe bathroom sink did not drain (or drained extremely slow) - which he warned me of\\r\\nThe sofa had an unpleasant smell - which made sleeping difficult\\r\\n\\r\\nMy opinion of the stay, however, may be different than others.  I am constantly traveling for work and look forward to a clean, comfortable night away from hotels when I utilize airbnb, which has happened in past stays.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the neighborhood is nice, Al, and his daughter, are very welcoming and Seattle is always great.  It comes down to what you are looking for individually.   Al’s place will definitely feel like home.  A comfortable bed, full access to the kitchen and living room,  he even cleaned out a space for me in his garage for my motorcycle .  Al is often away on business and when he is in town he stays in the downstairs apartment so often a guest feels as if he has rented an entire apartment and not simply a room. Al is also happy to help a guest out with advice on Seattle as well as just sit around and talk if you are in the mood (when you can catch him between running around on business).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those of you who dont know Seattle, Balard is one of the best locations in Seattle. Outside of the few tourist attractions, downtown  Seattle is not a very attractive  or interesting place to be, especially on weekends when alot of it closes up. Ballard has easy parking near Al’s, you can walk to the Ballard farmer’s market on Sunday. Movie theatre and great restaurants all withing walking distance from the place. Access to downtown  is just a short drive or bus ride away.\\r\\n Al made me feel welcome and comfortable in his home.  He recommended great restaurants within walking distance.  The house has an artsy warm atmosphere with good books and tasteful art.   My girlfriend and I had a nice stay at Al\\'s apartment.  I was a little concerned since the night before we arrived, he told me that a longer-term tenant had just moved out, and he wasn\\'t sure if he could dig the bedding out of storage in time for us.  But we were just driving up from Portland, so he agreed to give us a partial refund if we brought our own bedding.  I appreciated his flexibility, and it all worked out just fine.  We were pleasantly surprised that he gave us a nice organic fruit assortment when we arrived; he was very welcoming.  If you are looking for a sparkling-clean place with a newer kitchen and bath, you may be disappointed.  I know many would be turned off by things like the missing bathroom door knob, grease-stained kitchen ceiling,   and a cobweb or two.  But the bed was decent, and overall, we found it to be quiet, tidy, and cozy. I\\'m glad I was able to find a place.  Thank you Al, for calling me once I got to Seattle and being the \"extra\" mapquest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe property is actually a house.  I couldn\\'t figure out how to make the TV or radio work, but it didn\\'t matter.  I only used the place to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nice to find the Ballard market nearby. We stayed in Al\\'s little house for 3 weeks and greatly enjoyed exploring the Ballard neighborhood. The house is in a wonderful location to explore the attractions of the area (Ballard farmers market, locks, Golden Gardens Park, and local restaurants.) The house is older, and comes with its quirks, but overall a great value and experience.  The host canceled my reservation 4 days before arrival. We contacted Al in an emergency, with a death in the family meaning that we could not stay with family as planned, needing accommodation that same night. Al is the kind of host that likes to talk to you for a while, to get to know you a little & find out what you need. He said that he was preparing the house for a monthly rental & that he was not really prepared for a short term stay, to which I replied that we were flexible. As it happened, the dates fitted perfectly into the end of the month.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time we arrived, the place was ready, spotlessly clean and bare. After a chat with us, Al went out and bought everything that we would need for at least our first night, such as coffee, sugar, creamer, bowls, plates and toilet paper. We considered this to be \"above and beyond\". Al kept in touch during our stay, making sure that we were OK, not just with the accommodation, but for ourselves as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accommodation is, as it says, the top part of a small house, situated in a quiet family-oriented neighbourhood.  It has a quite large living room, bathroom with bath, an eat-in kitchen and a reasonable sized bedroom. The polished wood floors mean that the place needs a good sweep out every few days, which only takes a minute or two. The heating system works VERY well, heating the house to a comfortable level within minutes. The owner is super nice and accommodating. Because he was staying elsewhere, we basically had the house to ourselves - a nice deal when you\\'re traveling with children. Plenty of space.  Outstanding location.  And incredible price.  Cleanliness was an issue for me, however.  It just wasn\\'t a real comfortable place to be in.  A bit dirty.  Some ants in the kitchen. The toilet seat was broken. And the place held an unpleasant odor.  It\\'s an older home, yes.  I\\'m cool with things not being \"hotel-ish,\" but I would have appreciated a more comfortable environment.  We just slept there, and wouldn\\'t have wanted to spend any extra time in the home.   Still, for the price and location, it\\'s tough to beat. And who really wants to hang out inside when Seattle is beckoning?   I\\'ll probably spend a bit more money next time to hopefully get a cleaner place.  I\\'ll say again: the owner is really friendly and helpful.    Al was very accommodating and responsive when I got in touch\\r\\nwith him. I needed a place to stay for a couple nights with my\\r\\ndog and he made it easy to make arrangements for the same\\r\\nday.\\r\\nI had the whole place to myself so that was really nice.\\r\\nThe place itself was comfortable and was best for a short\\r\\nstay as it was pretty barren- nothing in the room except the \\r\\nbed, no t.v., etc. I mainly used the place to sleep.  We were on our second week of apartment hunting and in dire need of an interim place at the last minute.  Al was very accommodating, not only to us, but to the tenants after us in clearing with them that it would be OK if we had our cat with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl\\'s house is very comfortable, with a great living room (with a piano!) and adorable kitchen.  The bedroom is a great size, and the bed was a bit small for the two of us (I\\'m very tall), but comfortable.   He also has great photos of New Orleans all around the house which made me miss Nola a bit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl actually took the bus to the house to meet us with the keys on the same day we contacted him and spent time to show us around and made sure we were comfortable.  He also recommended a fantastic greek restaurant about a 20 minute walk away.\\r\\n\\r\\nI definitely recommend Al and his great Ballard home as a place to stay. We had an excellent stay at Al\\'s cozy Ballad apartment.  Al made sure we had everything we needed for the evening and even recommended an excellent Greek restaurant for us that we enjoyed for dinner. Quiet and comfortable neighborhood.  Would have been nice to have access to cable. Limited use of cooking due to small amount of dishes and cookware available for vacationing couples.  Al was very friendly and a great host that left fruit, juice, candy and sparkling water for our enjoyment. Al was great and we had the nice old house to ourselves.  At first glance, the yard needs some TLC but we had a great experience in the house and the area is quiet and well located.  Would go back for sure. Location, location, location. Ballard is great community about 15 min outside of Seattle. The downtown is filled with bars, shops and eateries and makes for a wonderful evening walk. First of all, the positives:\\r\\n  1. The neighborhood is great.\\r\\n  2. The apartment is spacious.\\r\\n  3. I didn\\'t see Al until the last day. He gave me my space and it was appreciated.\\r\\n 4. He left several beers and beverages in the fridge for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the negatives:\\r\\n  1. There was a broken window pane in one of the bedroom windows and the place was in a state of disrepair. The bathroom door was missing a knob. The screen door was broken.\\r\\n  2. The place was unclean. The bathtub was dirty, had signs of mold, and had half-used bars of soap lying in it. The same with the sink. There was an ancient bar of lava soap on the sink counter. The bedsheets were stained. On the stove top there were 2 unclean looking pots and there were tiny ants scurrying throughout the kitchen. \\r\\n  3. The full-sized bed was uncomfortable. It lacks a headboard and is on rollers. It would push away from the wall constantly. \\r\\n  4. There was only one roll of toilet paper in the place. I ended up buying my own so I could, um, survive the week.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the whole I would not recommend staying here. Al seems like a nice enough guy but the place is not well kept up and definitely not worth the money. There are much better options strewn throughout the city.  Al was flexible, warm, and friendly, and the neighborhood is quiet and only a ten-minute walk from the commercial streets in Ballard.  But the apartment is very bare bones: it might work best for someone planning a longer stay and really wanting to make it their own, or for folks who only need a place to crash and don\\'t care about frills. We stayed at Al’s place for 2+ months, so I suppose I am the AirBnB expert on this property, so here is the scoop. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Short Story: Your very-own complete apartment. Spacious. Convenient to the safe and great neighborhood of Ballard. Al is very easy-going and personable. He makes himself scarce, but he is there when you need him.  As long as you are not expecting a pristine hotel-type experience, you will be satisfied. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Long Version :\\r\\nAl lives in the basement, and you get the ENTIRE top of the house with your own entrance, living room, bathroom, bedroom, and plenty of space and closets. The kitchen is shared with a door on either side; to your place and his, but Al will give you so much space you may wonder if he even lives there, so really the kitchen is yours.  In the 2+ months we lived there, I only encountered him about 5 times, so it’s basically like having your own complete apartment! \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is pretty well furnished and the kitchen has all the basics you will need.  I have given Al some advice to make it more traveler and AirBnB friendly, so it should be a bit more equipped and fixed up than some of the prior reviews reflect. All of the minor negative items mentioned in previous reviews should be taken care of before you book the place, but they likely won’t even bother a reasonable person.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those out-of-towners, Ballard is a great neighborhood in Seattle [good bars, shops, food] and Al’s place is quite conveniently located to the main-drag of Ballard (its walkable). If you plan to be darting all over Seattle, Ballard may not be your prime location, as it doesn’t facilitate easily driving to many other neighborhoods of Seattle, but buses will get you around fairly easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl was very easy-going and helpful. He was always easily reachable, and whenever I had a concern, he took care of it almost immediately. He makes himself scarce, but he is there when something comes up, which is exactly what one wants in a landlord!  \\r\\n I didn\\'t stay there, but Al graciously offered a refund when it turned out that we could not make the trip.  I will look him up next time I am in Seattle…. If you\\'re looking for cheap accommodation in the cosy Ballard area, Al\\'s place might be an option. However, the apartment was not very clean, and I don\\'t think it had been hoovered before our arrival. The kitchen is shared with Al, who lives in the apartment. We chose not to use it, but we could hear when he was in the kitchen. That meant that the place didn\\'t feel very private to us, especially since there was only a close (but unlocked) door between our part of the apartment and the kitchen. The apartment is situated on a quiet street close to Market street and Ballard Ave, where plenty of restaurants and coffee shops can be found.\\r\\nAl was very helpful with recommendation to the area. We had a great time staying in Ballard and it was a good choice for two teachers on a budget. Al is very nice and personable. He offered us a glass of wine on arrival and suggested some music venues and restaurants in the area to check out. Ballard is a great part of the city to stay with lots of good coffee shops and restaurants close by. The house is well described in many of the other reviews. It is a good value for the price. It is not like staying in a hotel. But if you are looking for a cute neighborhood experience this is a good choice. Thanks Al! Everything about my stay was very nice. I had to arrive late due to my flight being delayed, Al left the door open and left me the key. We didn\\'t run into each other because of our schedules. We did play phone tag for a bit about an electrical issue but he always got right back to me when I contacted him. It\\'s very quiet in the neighboorhood so if you are looking for a city feel this isn\\'t it. I never heard a sound after 9 pm which is nice but for a young lady in a new city, I was a little far from the nightlife. Taxis were very helpful and only about 15$ from the house to the city center. The house was cute and clean with new linens. My only complaint was I was traveling alone as a young lady and the bathroom didn\\'t have a door knob or lock which Al warned me about in advance saying it was being repaired but he wasn\\'t sure if he would be free to fix it before I arrived. This was a little unsettling when showering and using the bathroom but Al never came over to that side of the house so there was nothing to worry about. There was also a door seperating the kitchen from Al\\'s part of the house. I never used the kitchen and the door couldn\\'t be locked which again made me feel a little uncomfortable being a woman alone in a strange place but Al never came over unannounced. In all, I would recommend this place to a friend especially a small family or couple. For a lady traveling alone, it\\'s not ideal but it worked.  This is a great place to crash when you\\'re exploring Ballard and Seattle. It\\'s a quick bus to the downtown core. You get what you pay for so if you\\'re looking for a five star place, this may not be it. The bed is very comfortable and a nice place to lay your head. There wasn\\'t enough toilet paper. Al was very attentive when we couldn\\'t find the house. It was a bit confusing for us as we arrived at night and there was no address on the house. If you\\'ll be out exploring most of the day - this is a great and cheap alternative to a hotel. Thanks Al!  Last weekend, my friend and I took a pretty impromptu trip up to Seattle from Portland. I sent the request on Friday and Al thankfully responded and accepted our last minute request for the next day! Our friends were playing a show at a venue in Ballard that was within walking distance from Al\\'s so it was perfect! When we arrived that afternoon, Al had just finished cleaning up the place and the sheets had been freshly laundered. He gave us some suggestions about where to eat and we ended up taking his advice and walking to an awesome Greek restaurant right off Market, about 10 minutes away. The house itself wasn\\'t luxurious or anything but it was warm, pretty clean and he provided us with some sparkling water and snacks. However, there wasn\\'t a hand towel in the bathroom and the doorknob still hasn\\'t been replaced in there. Overall, it was great for the price, just what we needed. Our stay in Al\\'s house fit our needs very well.  Right location, comfortable space, and accepted our little dog.  Al bustled around to get the space ready within 24 hours.  He clearly communicated about possible concerns that have already been discussed on his airbnb page so that there would be no unpleasant surprises.\\r\\nI was impressed with his friendly welcome and concise explanation of use of the house. We had a great stay at Al\\'s. It was super brief but it was the perfect crash pad in Ballard for our 1 night in town. If you want a comfortable, basic accommodation with privacy and peace, this is a good deal. Al is super nice and left goodies like chocolates, coffee and San Pellegrino too! Staying with Al was wonderful!  A fantastic host.  He offered us a bottle of wine upon arrival; took us on a tour of Ballard; and recommended lots of restaurants and night spots.  His flat is cozy and very conveniently located.  A fantastic trip - thanks Al! Myself and a friend stayed with Al for 3 nights in March. The apartment was cosy and comfy, and was in a good location for accessing the shops in Ballard and for getting the bus downtown. We got to meet Al, who was friendly and helpful, and gave us plenty of tips for where to go. Al was very accommodating and friendly, and his Ballard house was exactly what we were looking for.  A very short walk from great restaurants, record shops and coffee, but very quiet at night.  We would definitely stay there again. Lovely, bright and cozy. We had a great weekend; the piano was a big bonus for us. Beautiful original tiles in the bath and kitchen; large sunny bedroom and very comfy bed. It\\'s a very very quiet neighbourhood, we were awakened by the birds, which was really nice. Close to some really super restaurants.        Al seemed like a nice guy.  And very accommodating of having a dog.  Kitchen is shared with downstairs tenant.  Location is great too.  However overall clutter/cleanliness could be improved.  Some things like missing door handles on closets and bathroom, etc.   I contacted Al Parisi twice during my stay in Ballard, and both times he responded quickly and positively. First we had missed communications about getting the key, and Al showed up promptly to let us in. Then, when the shared kitchen tenants had left the kitchen a mess, he got on it and the kitchen was cleaned.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou approach his funky Ballard apartment through an overgrown front yard, and go into a living room with piano, musical instruments, festival posters and 1950s era drapes. And there was fruit and water to welcome us. \\r\\n\\r\\nA center hall has a bath on the left. The knob is still missing from the bathroom door, but we appreciated the selection of soaps and lotions that were there for us if we wanted them. The shared kitchen on the right is well-equiped, but it is not clear what pots, pans and tools are for common use and which are the downstairs tenant\\'s private things. An info sheet with hints about kitchen use, wi-fi, and checkout, f.i., would be helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hall also has a well-stocked supply closet. We found light bulbs there and replaced some burned out bulbs in the overhead fixtures.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the back of the hall is the bedroom, with a comfortable bed and warm quilt, and good closet and dresser space.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing polished and fancy here, but it was easy to settle into. The price was in our budget, and the location was right.  Al was a great host. The accommodations however were a bit different than expected. We were not informed that there were two young children in the apartment below us until after we arrived for our 6 day trip. \\nPrevious reviews stated that the apartment was a bit messy but comfortable. When we arrived we noticed the room we were staying in was very dirty. The bathroom shower curtain had black mold growing on it and the entire bathroom smelled like urine. The bathroom door knob is still missing (that wouldnt be a problem except the downstairs neighbors can walk in at any point. The shared kitchen was always very messy and dirty with food being left out for days. \\n\\nThese things being said, Al is a very kind person and was gracious enough to let us use his home. This apartment worked out very well for my family and I on a recent week-long trip to Seattle. Al met us upon our arrival and made us feel very welcome, even providing a local beer and some k-cup coffee for our stay. The apartment is a good size living room, plus a very small private bathroom and a good size bedroom (we fit a portable crib/pack-n-play in there). There is a also a kitchen space that is shared with the tenants who live downstairs (a very nice couple with a small child). The location is great, in a quiet neighborhood that is only a short walk into downtown Ballard and also 3-4 blocks to the bus line to get into downtown Seattle and elsewhere. For parents, there is a park 1-2 blocks away with a good playground area, including a sandbox (with trucks) and a zip line. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe place itself is somewhat rough around the edges, so don\\'t stay here expecting 4-star accommodations. We didn\\'t mind so much, but in the interest of openness and because I know some people care about this stuff, there are some things to note. The kitchen and bathroom both need a serious deep cleaning! I\\'m sure Al surface-cleaned these before we arrived but they both need serious professional attention. :) The doorknob is missing from the bathroom door  - didn\\'t matter to us but something to note if you are staying with people you aren\\'t intimate with. There were a lot of ants (we were there in the summer during a very hot week...). The bed, while pretty comfortable, doesn\\'t have a headboard or footboard so it is just the metal frame and mattress. Wasn\\'t an issue for us, but there isn\\'t a TV, stereo, or even speakers to plug into. Overall, these things didn\\'t get in the way of enjoying the place, and we still felt it was a good value for the money.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the fun side, there is a upright piano in the living room that we were told we could use, as well as a drum kit (!) which belonged to the tenant downstairs. The place is decorated with various posters and prints from various music festivals (mainly NOLA).\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, while some improvements could be made, I would definitely recommend this place for people seeking budget accommodations in Seattle. Al, the host, is super cool, the location is great, and it would be very hard to beat the price in the Seattle area. We did not have much communication with Al while in Seattle, but there really was not a need.  He made sure to let us know how to find entry and what to expect upon arrival.  Everything was as advertised.  For $75 a night I think this is a cozy little place that made us feel comfortable for our stay in this area.  The neighborhood is beautiful and public transportation is an easy walk about 5 blocks away.  The house is a little bit untidy, but that\\'s the only complaint, can\\'t expect too much.  We ran out of toilet paper on the last night, which made for an interesting last morning.  All in all, we were comfortable and had a good trip. Al came through for me in a pinch which I\\'m really grateful for. He\\'s a very kind man who has the best of intentions and even drove my friend and I around upon our arrival to see the local neighborhood. That being said, the accommodations are honestly less than stellar. All of the reviews are pretty accurate about this place but we had no other options during our time period. The house is generally untidy- the front yard looks overgrown and the screen door is missing a screen. There is even a boat dock out front with no boat! Inside there is a lot of clutter. We did have clean sheets and towels which was nice but the bathroom was not clean unfortunately. Maybe surface cleaned but the grout between tiles is black, there are wet (possibly moldy) spots on the ceilings. Ants crawling around everywhere. We woke up one morning to three dead moths in the shower. Short cab ride to Ballard and Markets streets but a long bus ride to downtown. Not ideal for two young girls on a road trip but we made the best of it. To be fair, the unit is priced on the cheap end for good reason. It\\'s clear you\\'re not getting top notch amenities but the space is big and Al is flexible. This was my second stay at Al\\'s place in Ballard and both times were great, easy access to Ballard and Freemont entertainment districts, a large comfy bed, and pet friendly... Al will be whatever you need out of a host, whether that be a local guide with plenty of knowledge to share or an unobtrusive presence while you do your own thing. Thanks Al! Als place worked great for our needs. It is definitely the most affordable place in the area that we could find and Al is a great host. Super kind and accommodating. We came to work a festival in Seattle and just needed a place to sleep at night, so Als home was perfect. Its a good budget place in Ballard, but if it was a hotel it would definitely be a 2 1/2 star. It definitely could have been cleaner and the door was a little tricky to open.  Al was a great host who went out of his way to make us feel welcome always, which was most appreciated when we first arrived. Al was kind enough to have beer and pizza waiting for us when we got to his place the first night, and after a canceled flight and an arrival time close to midnight, was the most appreciated.  He was always thoughtful and accommodating of our needs and respectful of our privacy throughout our stay. He also gave great suggestions on places to visit and resources for anything we needed.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe listing description is very accurate but reading the reviews was very helpful as well. I will say in agreeance of previous reviews that the place was very clean and tidy but if you need things deep cleaned and have an issue with things like dirty grout than this may not be the place for you -not judging, just saying. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen there\\'s the location. Located in Ballard, it was only a short walk to many great Ballard sites, fantastic restaurants, and scenic beaches, plus easy access to a cheap bus ride to downtown. Al even directed us to a place that was close by where we could rent bikes which made our experience even better. \\r\\n\\r\\nMore than anything what we loved about staying at Al\\'s house is that he made it feel like a home away from home and that you could tell that he genuinely wanted us to have a great stay in his home and in Seattle. We would definitely stay with Al in Ballard again next time we are in the area! What a wonderful quite place to stay.  So easy to get to anything in Ballard.  Al supplied anything we needed.  Would stay again if in the area.\\n We had a great time in our stay at Al\\'s place- loved the piano! My brother and I were in Seattle for Christmas, and Al was a great host. We had two dogs with us and very much appreciate that he let us stay in his home.  The space is great, and while there\\'s only one bed, the sofa is plenty large enough and quite comfortable to sleep on. I wouldn\\'t hesitate to recommend Al\\'s place to others who are looking to stay in Ballard. Al, was able to accommodate my husband and I perfectly to our needs. The apartment was clean and private. Al was nice enough to leave some snacks for us. Throughout our stay, He talked to me frequently making sure we had everything we needed.  It was great that Al got us in on such short notice.  There wasn\\'t a TV but the internet was sufficient.  I love Ballard and it was nice to find a place that takes dogs. I rented this for my rep who was doing work with me while in Seattle.\\r\\nShe said that Al was very nice and communicative, however the place was filthy, with a dirty kitchen, overflowing garbage and dust everywhere. I felt terrible that she has this experience while working with me. Al was very welcoming, phoning me a couple of times to see if everything was okay.  Everything was okay!  His rental is as described, cozy, though rooms are larger than cozy, clean, and warm with a comfortable double bed, and great towels.  The neighborhood is very quiet and convenient to places in Ballard  that we wanted to visit. Prior to our arrival I mentioned to him that I like having my coffee first thing in the morning so  he conveniently left out a coffee maker and  coffee in the kitchen for my use.   The place is simple and comfortable,  not new and  glamorous.  It suited us just fine and we would definitely stay at Al\\'s place again. Al\\'s place is definitely cozy, and it\\'s located in a great neighborhood. You are walking distance to grocery stores, restaurants, bars, cafes, and parks. There is plenty of street parking, and the neighborhood is very quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will have the top floor of the house, with Al and his daughter share the bottom level; the only shared space is the kitchen. We had a very comfortable stay in the place. We easily modified some things, such as stuffing a paper towel in the missing knob to the bathroom, bringing extra toilet paper, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stayed for an extended period of time (3 weeks) because we were moving from Texas, so we needed a place to stay while we located a permanent home. Major points are awarded to Al because he allows pets. We have a small dog and we were very happy to find a place that allowed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, we had a very comfortable stay. Since we stayed a long time, we made use of the kitchen a LOT and I would only mention that it is not fully stocked (something Al is working on), so there isn\\'t cutlery, there are limited pots & pans, and there is no microwave. I just mention that so you could get a better idea of what you are working with in case of a long term stay. In case of a short term stay, you are in a city with so many great restaurants that I doubt it would matter!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow as far as cleanliness, everybody has different standards. Like another reviewer mentioned, it\\'s not like this place has been deep cleaned, but as somebody who stayed a few weeks, I could definitely tell that Al definitely does general cleaning and upkeep of the space. But if you have any issues, Al is super accessible by email, phone and text. He really works hard to make sure you feel comfortable in his home, and he is open and willing to address any issues you may have. He is a really great host that respects your privacy while doing his best to address your needs. A cozy, comfortable, well-equipped and pleasant place to stay, in the heart of Ballard! Al and Angela were incredibly helpful. Would definitely stay here again. Felt at home. Thank you!  We LOVED our stay at Al\\'s home!! It was perfect for our family. Al\\'s place was really nice and quiet. His place is in Ballard which is close proximity to the city as well as the main roads if you need anything like groceries or gas. Nice and quiet neighborhood too. I have short notice but he had this place set up right away for me! Really nice guy. Great neighborhood. I\\'ll definitely book again. Thanks Al! The apartment is located in a great part of town and is very quiet. Despite the unusually warm temperatures we were very comfortable and slept really well (thank you, Al for the fan!). Al was great in returning my call regarding our arrival even though he had a really busy week and weekend. Our paths never crossed actually, but I had no doubt if we had needed anything, Al would aim to please! We weren\\'t in the apt very much during our stay and it worked out great for our purposes. Thank you Al! - Tracy Al and his place were great! Quiet neighborhood, close to downtown Ballard and easy to get to downtown Seattle from there. We had our 6 month old baby with us and Al was so kind to even let us use a pack n play that he had at the house so we didn\\'t have to take up extra room in the car to bring ours. Even the neighbors stopped to say hello to us as we were packing up the car to head home. It\\'s not fancy, but it\\'s quiet and comfortable and served all of our needs. I would highly recommend staying at Al\\'s place! Al was friendly on the phone.  Once we got there we did not hear from him but we were ok with that. The location is great.  Near a lot of restaurants and markets.  Quiet and safe neighborhood.  The house is small but just fine for a couple of people. The house has potential and with work could be a very nice place.  The bed was comfortable.  It could use some TLC with paint, maintenance and deep cleaning. Al\\'s place is great! I noticed that some has commented about place not being clean. My comment for that is that is \"Yeah sure it\\'s missing a female touch. But it\\'s a guy that is renting it.\" So if you are really fancy then it\\'s maybe not for you, but I felt at home. And will stay there for my next visit if it\\'s available. Thanks Al. Very relaxed. Easy going.  This apartment is located close to all things Ballard, which was why we decided to stay here.  We stayed only two nights of the total we booked due to a change in travel plans.  Al was good on communication, but the place could use some maintenance.  The front door was sticky, the screen door was broken, and the dryer wasn\\'t working.  The yard could also use some maintenance and clean up.  If you are looking for a place close to Ballard, and are on a budget, this will work just fine.  Just don\\'t expect anything fancy. Al was the nicest! Cute rustic quarters in a darling neighborhood (with some fantastic restaurants within walking or bike distance!). Al was incredibly accommodating, and was very flexible to work with us regarding our visit. The bed was comfy and clean, and we will definitely be looking up Al again next time we come to town. Al was a great host - very friendly and welcoming - and the place was comfortable and in an amazing location!  We were so glad we were staying in Ballard, and thought the place was a great deal for the price! I had a great stay at Al\\'s apartment. It\\'s located on the main floor of a little bungalow and Al lives in the basement. The space isn\\'t flashy, but it\\'s warm, cozy, and feels like a cottage right in the middle of Seattle. The bed was really comfortable and so was the giant couch in the living room. Al left us some snacks and wine which we appreciated. We never met, but he seems very easy going about everything. For the price, this is an excellent accommodation in Seattle and I would absolutely stay here again.  Al was a very welcoming and laid back host which helped to make our week long stay very pleasant.  Although Al\\'s place is in the middle of a family-friendly neighborhood, the nearest coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants, and bars are just blocks away.  We had both dogs stay with us and felt very safe walking them in the neighborhood after dark.  This was a great value for the amount of space provided, which was helpful for two people and two dogs. We stayed with Al for a long weekend and had a wonderful stay! The apartment was cozy and well located.  We loved this quiet little spot in Ballard. Al was welcoming and understanding and provided us with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  When we return to Seattle, we would definitely stay here again.   This was a fantastic airbnb choice. The RV has been lovingly redecorated and has everything you could need. There\\'s a kitchennette, sitting room and cosy bedroom. We slept really well there. Thank you Jeremy for being a great host. Fine hosts.  Nice place, all as described, comfortable bed, private.    We had a fantastic time at the RV! It\\'s the perfect budget option for a stay in Ballard. You can tell the hosts want you to feel comfortable in the space with the nice-smelling soaps and snacks. My husband and I appreciated how cozy it was. Also close to some delicious places to eat like Delancey, Honore Artisan Bakery and Un Bien, which was Jeremy\\'s recommendation. I\\'d very much encourage people to stay.  Nice, cozy, clean, comfortable and convenient. What\\'s not to like about that? Jeremy was a great host, and had good recommendations for places to eat in the neighborhood. The area was quiet, but easy access to 15th Avenue made getting around simple.   Jeremy and Family were wonderful hosts! Before I had even asked, they let me know that the BBRV was clean and ready, and gave me lots of information prior to my arrival about how to operate everything inside. It rained heavily one night and Jeremy made sure everything was fine and that there weren\\'t any leaks :) It was a beautiful little get-away, stocked with lots of thoughtful features. The neighborhood was very quiet during my stay, but near all of the fun that Ballard has to offer! I will be recommending the BBRV to any seattle-goers that I know of, and would love to stay again! I had a great time.  The info packet was very comprehensive and the little notes that Jeremy put around were helpful as well.  It was clean and comfy.  He let me do my own thing. He was very responsive on text and email. I loved staying here.  I had a rental car and getting here was pretty straight forward.  After a day out on the town we always looked forward to coming back to BBRV! If anyone has reservations about staying in an RV, let me just say: it\\'s awesome. I can\\'t imagine a more fun and luxurious stay. While the interiors of most off-the-lot RVs are pretty tacky, Jeremy has put a lot of work into making BBRV feel very modern and homey with brand new wood floors and tasteful decor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn\\'t interact much with Jeremy,which speaks to how effective of a host he is. Entering and exiting the property is quick and discreet and all the information we needed was provided throughout the home.   He makes sure all of the amenities are taken care of including toiletries, beverages, and snacks, which were much appreciated. Thanks Jeremy! Loved staying at the BBRV! I often travel to Seattle from Vancouver  for short trips and will definitely consider staying here again.  All was exactly as described and as promised.  Extremely nice hosts. This backyard RV was just what we needed for our trip to Seattle. It\\'s in a convenient location to all the sites and has several great nearby restaurants. Jeremy was very helpful and prompt with communication! The RV was clean and had everything we needed. Would definitely consider returning if we come back to Seattle!! My (now) Fiance\\' and I had a wonderful stay at Jeremy\\'s airbnb. The space was cozy, clean, and a fun place to \"camp\" in the city. The location was unbeatable -- so many great places to walk to in downtown Ballard, and really easy to catch the D Line direct to downtown. I definitely recommend a stay at Jeremy\\'s if you find yourself in Seattle! Jeremy and his family have created such a thoughtful, clean, quiet, lovely place to stay. I was able to walk to many places and felt like I had my own little oasis in the bustle of Seattle. Excellent Airbnb!! Thanks Jeremy! Jeremy and Suzanne were great hosts who paid attention to all the things that make one feel at home.  They provided breakfast items, milk, tea and coffee.   The towels were thirsty, the bed was super comfortable.  The RV is surprisingly spacious. We enjoyed our time here! We had a really nice stay. The RV is very beautiful and we had everything we need there. Jeremy is very friendly. I totally recommend staying here. :) The listing for the Ballard Backyard RV was very accurate. It was a little cold outside on our visit during Thanksgiving, but were very comfortable  in the RV. The treats and breakfast stuff was appreciated. We had another excellent stay at Jeremy\\'s RV, and appreciated all the thoughtful touches to make us comfortable, especially the breakfast foods, milk, and even Christmas decorations!  Thank you again. This two bedroom condo in Ballard is a delightful and accommodating space outfitted with all you need for you stay.  It is close to two great streets for shopping, including casual cafes and fine dining, grocery, books, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nMario was a terrific host, very responsive and personable.  I called about wifi and he called right back to help me get on the right network, adding that he hoped our stay would be pleasant and to let him know if we need anything else. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe highly recommend this condo and look forward to our next stay! This is why I love AirBnB.  We couldn\\'t ask for a better space, location, and host. The top floor of Mario\\'s place was perfect for the 4 of us (two couples).  Amazing coffee shops, a cute bakery, and great local bars all within walking distance and still close enough for a quick drive downtown. The house was stocked with everything we could possibly need and kept immaculately. Having a dedicated parking spot was really great too as parking can be a hassle depending on where you are.  I would definitely stay here again next time I visit lovely Seattle.   Mario\\'s home was exactly how it was explained in the listing. It was clean and bright and he had all the creature comforts that anyone could possibly need. Mario is a very gracious host and willing to oblige you with whatever you may need. \\r\\nI would highly recommend staying at Mario\\'s home to anyone. \\r\\nThank you again Mario,\\r\\nCeci & Sal Giordano.  The reservation was canceled 98 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. We stayed for a whole week in Mario\\'s amazing upstairs loft unit.  The unit was perfect for us and had everything we needed.  It\\'s located in a great area (Ballard) that has dining, shopping, and great sights all within walking distance.  While we didn\\'t need the extra room, the unit is extremely flexible with the upstairs loft beds to accommodate additional guests.  Also very nice was the complimentary parking space for our rental car.  We loved our time in Seattle and would not hesitate to stay at Mario\\'s unit again! The place and Mario were both outstanding. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlenty of room for the 6 of us. \\r\\n\\r\\nMario was warm and inviting as we both happened to meet upon arrival. He had great recommendations on things to do and places to eat. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is great. It was very close to downtown Ballard where there are a lot of great restaurants and bars. Short walk also down to the Locks and to Paseo\\'s, a must go! Short bus ride into downtown Seattle and the bus stop is about 100 yards from the house. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely stay here again! \\r\\n I have only positive comments! The apartment was fantastic, with plenty of room for our family (five adults). It\\'s just a short walk to the restaurants and stores in Ballard, and from this location it\\'s very easy to drive to other parts of Seattle. We appreciated the comfortable furniture and layout, the availability of a parking spot, and the fact that everything was so clean and spotless. Mario was very responsive and friendly. I just hope this space is available the next time we all travel to Seattle!  I really enjoyed the design of the building details and the efficient use of space.  The neighborhood was very walkable:  We bought groceries, did some window shopping, went to a CrossFit class and ate out for breakfast and dinner, each within a 15 minute walk of the house.  Mario was flexible and responsive and the house was comfortable and clean, quite perfect for our needs.  Thank you! I had a few colleagues coming into town from Spain and needed a place for them to stay. Mario was very helpful throughout the entire process. The apartment was very clean, comfortable and in a great location. They had an excellent trip and will definitely be staying here again on their next visit! Mario\\'s place was perfect! We arrived and everything was spotlessly clean and just as described with a great kitchen with all the needed amenities.  The bed were very comfy and the linen was new and cozy plus access to free laundry, a gym and bikes! Highly recommended! We would stay there again in a heartbeat! Thanks. We had a wonderful time at Mario\\'s. The place is beautiful, new furnished,  clean and comfortable.  We had some questions, Mario respond instantly and was very nice and helpful. All in all, it was great! Clean, beautiful flat within walking distance to all the things we wanted to do. Mario made our first airbnb experience easy! If we are in your vicinity again we\\'ll definitely stay again! My family and I had a great stay and hope to stay here next time in the future! Mario was great to chat with through the entire reservation process! The condo was clean, organized, and had everything we needed for a fun weekend. The location was an easy walk to the heart of Ballard as well as the marina for kayaking and paddle boarding. Mario was doing some watering outside and greeted us on arrival, and just made sure we knew how to use the passcode to get into the unit. The neighborhood is nice, quiet residential with stores and restaurants nearby, easy access to bus/Metro, easy parking on the street. The unit was neatly furnished and worked out well for our two family group; two private bedrooms and sleeping lofts above for the kids. We all felt right at home.  Mario\\'s home was clean and stocked for everything we could have needed for a wedding weekend in Seattle. We would stay here again! The apartment was lovely, clean and and well-situated.  The beds were large and comfortable. Ballard is a hopping, trendy neighborhood, and we were able to catch the #40 bus to downtown from the corner - easy, peasy!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had the misfortune of spending 1 1/2 weeks in Seattle during an historically hot and dry period (no clouds or rain!), and Mario came immediately when we called to check the central air.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lofts were fine for the teenagers we brought with us, but anyone who isn\\'t young or who is prone to inebriation might find the ladders challenging to climb.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI would unequivocally recommend this apartment, and Mario as a host. Very welcoming, the neighbors were friendly. There is a bunch of construction going around next to the property, but the workers were definitely quiet and accommodating to the people around. House was a nice, tidy fit. I would definitely recommend staying there again. It was a real convenient area to be around everything at such a price! The listing description was very accurate, the house is actually larger in person than the pictures indicate. The lofted beds were very comfortable and Mario had fans upstairs to help control the room temperature.  Great place. Great location. Great city! Thanks Mario for the seamless experience ! We had a very good experience staying in this house. It is only a walk away from the cool cafes and ship locks of Ballard, my favorite neighborhood of Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house exceeded our expectations. It was more modern and more well lid than the pictures in the photos. There was tea and coffee and anything else we might desire, such as an iron board to iron our clothes before a wedding we were attending.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a few questions during our stay, for example at what time was checkout, and Mario was were quick and helpful in his responses. Overall, we had a perfect rental experience. Mario\\'s place was great for my party. The lofts were spacious, bathroom was clean and cute with plenty of amenities. This place worked great for our group of 8 close-knit adults. The interior was actually nicer and a bit larger than what I was expecting from the pictures. The location is a quiet neighborhood with ample street parking, yet an easy walk to plenty of restaurants, bars, and attractions in Ballard. The owner was also readily available via text to answer any questions. We loved this place.  It had everything we needed and felt like home.  The only thing that would have made it better would be a bigger bed.  (The bed is a full-size murphy bed that converts to a table.)  It was quiet except for an occasional bark or two and private.  Cyndy was very gracious and responsive to our needs.  We felt lucky to have made such a find and hope to stay there again next visit. A true hidden gem, literary a tree house, just a short ride away from downtown Seattle. It\\'s perfect for a weekend gateaway. Fits 2 people comfortably. Cyndy\\'s studio is in a residential area for which I felt really safe. I had a little bit of a concern leaving my brand new car on the street but as soon I drove in the area it felt really safe. I really enjoyed my stayed while in Seattle. Listing is accurate: cute, cozy apartment in a lovely neighbourhood. Cyndy was easy to communicate with and left us out an extra aerobed. We stayed only one night and only just to sleep but would be a good place to use a homebase seattle Cyndy\\'s place was great! Very private with off street parking that was greatly appreciated. I had a couple unexpected guests for a few nights and being new to air B&B I half expected  it would cause problems with Cyndy but she proved to be a very generous and gracious host. \\r\\nThank you Cyndy! The apartment was so cozy and cute, and Cyndy was a wonderful host. Feels like you are in a lovely little tree house! I would definitely recommend this space! The apartment was exactly as described! Very cozy, and a great use of space. We stayed just one night here while in the city for business, and it was perfect.  Had everything we needed from a hot shower to a great coffee machine.  Awesome location, plenty of parking, so close to Ballard and easy access to the rest of the city.  Wish we would have been able to stay longer and walk around the neighborhood more to enjoy all the trees and flowers in bloom right now.  We didn\\'t get the chance to meet Cyndy as we arrived too late, but everything was set up and ready for us! I would definitely stay here again when back in Seattle.  Cindy was easy to communicate with and responsive to requests. The apartment was beautiful with an upscale (and apparently new) interior.   She made me feel like I was at home by texting me on time to make sure everything g is ok prior to my arrival, she had nice blankets and nice shampoo:) also very thing was perfectly clean and organized I was really happy  We ran into Cyndy upon arrival. She was very welcoming and even offered us a bottle of wine! The description was very accurate, it did feel like we were in a tree house. The apartment was very clean and even had a  luxurious feel to it with heated floor tiles in the restroom! The place was everything we expected and more. We will definitely come back in the future. Thanks Cyndy!  Fantastic! The apartment was beautiful (so much light!) and very comfortable. The location was perfect for us - quiet in the immediate neighborhood around the house, but an easy walk down to shops and delicious restaurants. We\\'d happily stay here again! Cyndy was accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed.  The space was very efficient and perfect for our little get away.  I appreciated the way everything was put together, and if I had a space like that of my own, I would make it very similar.  As another reviewer noted, the heated floor in the bathroom (including the shower) was a great touch.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an easy walk into the heart of Ballard where there are plenty of places for food and entertainment (and shopping if you are into that).  We parked our car and walked everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would certainly book with Cyndy again! The apt is gorgeous - really well planned for a small space.  I had everything I needed to enjoy my 2 week visit.   Our stay at Cyndy\\'s bnb was excellent! I was pleasantly surprised upon walking in because honestly, the photos don\\'t quite do it justice! Very spacious, bright, clean and comfortable. Had everything we needed for a comfortable night\\'s stay, I even bugged them for cream and sugar in the morning and they brought it to me right away. Ample street parking in a charming Seattle neighborhood. Great first airbnb experience. :) So great! This \"treehouse\" studio was so comfortable and in a great location for us. It was the perfect place to call home for a few days.  The neighborhood was so quaint. We enjoyed walking to Cafe Besalu and Golden Gardens Park. A beautiful space that we\\'d gladly book again! Thank you, Cyndy, for sharing your home with us for a few days. I can\\'t wait to visit again! We loved Cyndy\\'s studio! Cyndy is a great host - she was very accommodating when we had to make a change to our reservation and was always quick to respond to any questions we had. She has a LOVELY studio. It is tucked away behind her home above the garage. It is so quiet, clean, ADORABLE, and had everything we needed for our stay. We would most definitely stay here again! Thanks Cyndy!! The host was very hands off, but we didn\\'t need her for anything either so that worked for us. She let us know what the passcode was, and we got in fine. The place was exactly what we were looking for - very clean, full of light, and had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable. We loved our stay, and would definitely be back! Thank you. :)  I can\\'t say enough about Cyndy and her adorable studio in the trees!  Talk about extraordinary space planning...the high ceiling and open concept made the place feel airy and inviting. The super cute, newly done bathroom with heated floors felt like a mini spa, which was such a treat after a 4 day camping trip at the Gorge.  Such a wonderful place to lay your head down and enjoy the skylights and views of the trees surrounding the property. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for your hospitality, Cyndy! \\r\\n\\r\\n- Melanie + Clinton This place was great. Exactly as advertised. A perfect place to stay while vacationing in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. Cyndy was great! Communication was really good and although we didn\\'t meet in person, she was available for questions. Place was immaculate, and due to the new construction, everything was very new and had a modern look to it. Would definitely stay here again if I visit Seattle in the future! Loved the studio.  Modern, clean, and with lots of natural light.  Comfortable bed.  Very private too.  Good communication with Cindy, who will provide any assistance that you may need, otherwise she stays out of your way.  We wanted to stay in Ballard, so the location was great for us.  Definitely one of my best airbnb experiences!  Thanks Cyndy. What a wonderful place to stay in Seattle!  It\\'s a charming a quiet studio nestled in the treetops.  Cyndi provided us with clean towels and sheets as well as her contact info for any reason.  We loved how close this studio was to Golden Gardens park.  If you are looking for an extremely pleasant experience, look no further.  Thanks again Cyndi! The space was great, very comfortable and convenient. The neighborhood was very peaceful and pretty. Cyndy was a fantastic host. I rented Cyndy\\'s apartment for my mom while she was in town.  My mom really enjoyed her stay- the space was clean, modern, light and really well taken care of.  The location is quiet and residential but very close to the heart of Ballard- just perfect!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for a great experience, Cyndy!  What a wonderful experience for our first AirBnB stay! Cyndy and her husband were welcoming and great hosts. We didn\\'t see much of them, but when we did they were very kind. The suite is beautiful, the photos don\\'t do it justice! So much light, so many windows, and the skylights over the bed are a beautiful touch. It was great to be within walking distance of some lovely shops, and only a half hour bus ride to downtown. We loved our stay here, and would definitely stay again if we return to Seattle! My girlfriend and I stayed in Cyndy\\'s wonderful studio apartment above the garage for two nights. Its the most spacious studio I\\'ve ever been in, with tons of natural light! Open all the windows and it feels like you\\'re up in the trees. The apartment comes with basic amenities if you want to stay in and make dinner at home (which we did one night), but its also an easy walk down to the shops and restaurants of Ballard which are plentiful and worth exploring. You can also walk 5 or so blocks east and catch a bus straight to downtown Seattle. If you\\'re looking for a quiet, private, cozy place to hang your hat after exploring what Seattle has to offer - Cyndy\\'s apartment is the perfect place for it! Great place! Thanks so much. Cyndy graciously met us upon arrival.  The apartment is bright, clean and welcoming. It had everything we needed for a 5 day stay. The neighborhood is quiet, and we enjoyed beautiful flower gardens on our short walk to shopping and restaurants.  The location is great.  Cyndy was very nice and responsive and the place was perfect.  The apartments was clean and stocked with everything we needed.  There was no iron, but I asked Cyndy about it and she promptly brought one to us.  I would absolutely stay at this place again. We really enjoyed our stay! The apartment has plenty of room and is very comfortable. The apartment is secluded and quiet and also very convenient to several restaurants.  Place was very nice and clean.  It was just what we needed to get a good rest. Cyndy\\'s place was perfect! Clean, comfortable and spacious. Cyndy greeted us and offered coffee in the morning. She let us do our own thing but was available if we needed. I will definitely stay at Cyndy\\'s place next time I\\'m in town.  The cozy studio apartment is wonderful!  Clean, fresh, and beautiful!  It met all my needs!  I was able to read, sleep, exercise, cook and still had room left over.  The host is very friendly and always was available for any needs I had. I highly recommend the cozy studio apartment.  The neighborhood is safe and friendly and within walking distance of parks and restaurants.  What a great place to stay!  Thank you!  Cyndy and her place were both great! We didn\\'t need much from her, but she was quickly and helpfully responsive when we reached out with questions. Her place was just as described, and was perfect for our stay. Highly recommended! My husband and I really enjoyed our two night stay in Ballard! We were within walking distance of everything we wanted to do there. Cyndy made it very easy to arrive and get settled into her beautiful space. Everything was clean and like new. Nice shower and spacious enough to relax at the end of the day. So much nicer and affordable than a hotel. We will certainly go back.\\r\\nKim from Colorado Our stay at the cozy studio apartment was fantastic. The location was great, walking distance (about 15 minutes) from the downtown Ballard area and right off the 40 bus line for easy access to the rest of the city. The apartment was charming, clean, and nicely decorated. The Murphy bed is a fun touch though in our personal experience we left it in bed mode the entire time, never in the \"up\" or table positions. The apartment is detached from the rest of the house above a garage, so it was nice and quiet. The kitchen is modestly stocked with eating utensils, instant coffee, tea, glassware, plates and bowls, an electric kettle, and other niceties. Wifi was reliable. Overall a great stay, thanks Cyndy! My boyfriend and I spent one night in Cyndy\\'s studio apartment and overall we had a great time. The apartment was very clean and cutely decorated. For staying in an apartment above a garage in the middle of August, it stayed comfortably cool in there. I just loved the adorable bathroom and really appreciated that she provided shampoo and conditioner because I forgot mine. Her street is so quiet which we also appreciated. We live in a busy part of Portland where we constantly hear cars drive by so it was almost eerie how silent her street is. Aside from hearing a neighbor kid play in his yard for a few minutes, we heard nothing the whole time we were there. Just a note: if you\\'re like me and don\\'t pay close attention to the listed Amenities, this unit does not have a TV so be sure to bring a book or your own device for entertainment purposes. I feel I should also mention one more thing: we saw a few ants in the apartment the night before and when were cleaning up the next morning to leave, the kitchen counter was positively CRAWLING with ants. I know its normal for ants to come in doors in the summer (and I promise, the place is very clean!) so I\\'m not holding that against her, I\\'m just saying...there may be ants. Other than that, the place was perfect and is such a steal compared to hotel prices. Lastly! We recommend Portage Bay Cafe for breakfast about a mile away. CRAZY GOOD FOOD! Simple easy stay! The place was awesome! Clean, professional, private. A+! Cyndy\\'s apartment is very cozy and comfortable. It\\'s in a great location and overall a great place to stay.  We were lucky to stay at this cozy little private studio apartment for a weekend. It had everything we needed and the location couldn\\'t have been better for us. The area is great for walks. There\\'s a park nearby and a great little bakery. We loved the skylights and the accessibility of the place!! It was a cute place that was very clean, private, and comfortable. They had a stereo to hook our phone into for music which was a nice perk and wifi. Cyndy was also very friendly.  Listing was completely accurate. Beautiful neighborhood, cozy and comfortable space. Favorite thing was the trick murphy bed / dining room table combo. Small space with the perfect furniture to use the space as one sees fit. Loved it. Simply LOVED this place! What an amazing concept. Fantastic neighborhood, never any concerns returning at night or parking on the street. Great host and Cyndy\\'s on top of communication. Would stay here again in a heartbeat, so close to Ballard, and a short drive to Queen Anne, Belltown and Seattle Center. Thanks again for everything and we hope to return sooner than later :D Cyndy was really nice and the apartment was incredible. Made for a great night and gave us lots of ideas for our own place, dream place anyway. Cyndy\\'s home was beautiful! Very easy to locate and a perfect amount of space. The cozy studio was just what we were looking for. The keypad entry system made for a very easy check in and check out. The studio itself was the perfect size to accommodate 2 of us and though we did not use it, there was a a very functional kitchen provided. Our hosts were very willing to provide recommendations for things to do. We will definitely be returning here if the opportunity arises.  This place was so much better than the pictures. It\\'s perfectly designed. We loved the decor and set up of the studio. I would love to stay again. It felt very safe.  PROS: My boyfriend and I LOVED this studio!!! It was super cute, had tons of quality upgrades (heated bathroom floor!), was cleverly and efficiently designed, and immaculate! Cyndy, our host, welcomed us by having the Murphy bed out and made, ready to crawl in! (not sure if this was because I advised her our plane was delayed 3 hours or not, but appreciated nonetheless!) Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised to find many extras: soap/shampoo/conditioner in the shower (and quality to boot, in my opinion), tea & instant coffee in the kitchen, quality dishes and silverware (no shortcuts here) and more hangers than most hotels!  The wi-fi was faster than most hotels, too! There were also extra blankets and pillows: I\\'m a bit of a princess-and-the-pea about my bed, and I needed the flatter bonus pillows. :o) The bedding was comfy and homey, the bath towels sparkling white and soft, and the whole place just felt welcoming. Cyndy had conveniently provided easy-to-use recycling and compost bins, and helpful notes to call out less obvious features (reading light above bed). These things speak volumes about the host\\'s dedication to providing her guests a positive experience!\\r\\n \\r\\nI loved the neighborhood - both because it was quiet, and because I grew up in Ballard. ;o) The only neighbors we encountered were friendly. I was in town for a wedding at the Seattle Aquarium, and it was an easy drive from the studio.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'d emailed Cyndy with questions prior to our arrival, and she was always quick to reply and helpful. Because of the timing of our arrival, and the fact that we were in town for a wedding so almost never there, we never got to meet our hosts. :o( I wasn\\'t sure it was rude not to make a point to check in - or appreciated: I hope the latter... ;o)\\r\\n\\r\\nCONS - with caveats: It\\'s no surprise - being in Seattle - that the unit had so many large windows, and the two skylights: I loved and appreciated the natural light! That said, sleeping in (especially after our very late/early arrival) was challenging (seasonal, of course). The Murphy bed - while VERY comfortable and a great way to take advantage of the small footprint - was a double bed (not a queen). The description may have mentioned this, I don\\'t remember, and it certainly wasn\\'t a deal-breaker for us. However, if one or both guests happen to be tall (I\\'m not) or both above-average builds (I am), it would probably be snug. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll-in-all, the place was practically perfect! We would definitely stay here again. It feels very much like a home-away-from-home! Cyndy\\'s rental is beautifully maintained and our stay was everything we expected. Nice home, nice neighborhood, fun stuff to do only a mile away. Clean and comfortable, a great place to stay in Seattle\\'s Ballard neighborhood. The space was simply beautiful! All details were covered. We even took pictures of the space of how well it was designed and laid out. Exactly what Airbnb should be. Great communication, beautiful and comfortable space, and all amenities needed to enjoy your stay. This place felt like a luxury resort not just a spare room.  Do not hesitate to book. Thank you! We had a great time staying with Cyndy! The studio is just as described - cozy and welcoming. And it has great light! We easily walked (about 20 minutes) down to the locks and around Ballard for the evening - lots of lovely shops and fun places to eat. Dealing with Cyndy was super easy - she was responsive and logistics were smooth. If you are looking for a relaxing, quiet place to stay in Seattle, this is a great bet. Fantastic studio! Very clean and comfortable. I loved staying here.  Was a very warm and welcoming studio.  Will definitely be staying here again on my next trip. My husband and I (both retirees) travelled from Ireland to Seattle to visit our son and his family who live in Ballard.  We arrived late in the evening and Cyndy welcomed us and then left us to get settled in. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe were delighted with the apartment. It was spotless and fully equipped. The Murphy bed (which I must admit I was a bit dubious about) was wonderful!  It was comfortable and easily turned into a good-size table.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location of the apartment is ideal. The bus for Ballard and downtown Seattle stops about a 5-minute walk away and Ballard itself is a 10-15 minute walk (a bit longer returning because it\\'s uphill).\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday, helped in a huge way by knowing that we could come and go as we pleased and could relax in the lovely cozy studio apartment. We would certainly recommend it. Cyndy\\'s place is absolutely gorgeous. This was our first trip to Seattle and we couldn\\'t have chosen a better location to call \"home\" temporarily. We could have spent all or our time in Ballard, there were so many cute shops and restaurants around the house (we tried out Pie Bar and Walrus and the Carpenter both were excellent!) Cyndy\\'s apartment was very clean and bright. The skylights above the bed were beautiful. It was also nice already having shampoo and conditioner to use, and the little extras were definitely appreciated. Cyndy also kept in contact, which was nice. We couldn\\'t have asked for anything more. Cyndy\\'s place is very nice and unique. I really enjoyed staying at her place and she was kind.  Recommend! !!! :) We came and stayed for one night to see a concert. Looked a a lot of options but chose this because of what it offered and the area it is in. \\r\\nWhat we look for in a place is for it to be clean, quiet and bright which this place has in spades. It is like having your own little house with all the necessary accoutrements. \\r\\nThe owner was very helpful and personable. I would say that she extended courtesies that you would otherwise not expect. \\r\\n\\r\\n My stay went perfect here. It was very easy to find and I was impressed when entering the apartment.  The apartment was extremely clean, peaceful, modern, and included eveything I needed for the stay.  Cyndy and Tom were great hosts. Cyndy always communicated quickly and was helpful when suggesting places to eat.  Tom even called a friend to help me find a bicycle rental.  The neighborhood was very nice, safe, quiet, and close to downtown Ballard. We had a lovely stay here. The air B and B was really cute and just as charming as the pictures showed. The neighborhood was wonderful to stroll around and, within about a 10-15 minute walk, there were restaurants and cafes to enjoy. The bus took us directly downtown and made it easy to get around. We loved it all! We very much enjoyed our stay at Cyndy\\'s studio in Ballard. It is a convenient, walkable neighborhood. The studio is perfectly designed with efficient and remarkable use of space, and everything was spotless and inviting. We fell in love with the Ballard neighborhood instantly. The studio was absolutely perfect.  Just as pictured. We can\\'t wait to come visit again and hopefully be able to stay with Cyndy again.  Thanks again Cyndy for everything. Great space in a quiet neighborhood, close to all of the wonderful attractions of vibrant Ballard. The apartment is cozy, modern and comfortable and we look forward to staying at Cyndy\\'s place the next time we come to Seattle. Clean, easy, comfortable, cozy. It was exactly what we needed for a quick overnight in Seattle.  Great spot and super organized owner! And in my favorite Seattle neighborhood.   My husband & I thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay in this lovely apartment!  It is located in a very quiet neighborhood with easy parking.  This newly constructed studio is bright and clean with tall, open beam ceilings & lots of windows overlooking the surrounding tree tops.  The bathroom & kitchen are top-notch and the bed is quite comfy.  We appreciated being able to come & go as we pleased and definitely plan to return in the future. The location was perfect for me and the hostess was very welcoming and helpful.  What a great experience! Thanks Cyndy for making your studio available. With options like this, why would anyone choose a hotel? \\r\\n\\r\\nPros: Excellent location in Ballard and a great value. Safe, quiet, beautiful and not far from shops and dining; quick trip to downtown; comfy bed. The studio feels new and clean and secure, with tasteful decor and high end interior finishes. I loved the retro-modern feel and the great layout - everything you need (two people best) without feeling cramped. \\r\\nCons: No TV, but otherwise perfect!\\r\\n\\r\\nI also loved the easy check in and out - Cyndy was responsive to my texts (I had a very late check in) the keypad on the door eliminated any key concerns and parking was plentiful and free! \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Cyndy - I\\'ll be back again.\\r\\n Staying at Cyndy\\'s couldn\\'t be more perfect. Easy communication and great little apartment in a favorite neighborhood. Very clean and cozy, would have loved to stay longer! Great neighborhood, new, cute and incredibly clean studio! Even heated floors in the bathroom. It is the perfect location to explore Ballard and Seattle.  Cyndy had everything prepared for my arrival. The studio had all of the conveniences of a hotel in a residential neighborhood. Originally I thought the studio was going to be in an apartment building, but it was actually built above the garage in the back of the house. They did a really nice job with the space and everything is clean and updated. It\\'s small, but it is the right amount of space. As other reviews have mentioned, the bathroom with the heated floors was a nice touch. I would recommend staying here to other guests. Listing was perfect for our needs. Warm, clean, quaint studio apartment above the garage. It was the perfect little base from which we could explore Ballard and Seattle. Thanks Cyndy! safe, nice neighborhood. Easy to find parking, very clean, comfortable bed, extra airbag for my child to sleep on. Instant Starbucks coffee, tea, extra blanket, iron.\\r\\nVery nice pans, plates. This was the perfect location for us this Christmas; a lovely, cozy place to end our days, a sweet little neighborhood within easy walking of cafes and shops and hosts who were present and attentive but not intrusive. For some inexplicable reason the shower rod/curtain fell down in the middle of the night and Cyndy promptly had it replaced the next day. I highly recommend this apartment.  As long as my son stays living in Ballard (and continues to have 4 roommates) I will be back to stay. Thanks Cyndy for creating such a beautiful little retreat. Myself, my husband and our 3 year old son stayed in this house for 2 and a half weeks.  We had a very enjoyable time there! We helped mind the owners chickens who were very cute and we enjoyed being able to collect fresh eggs from them every day.  The house is located in a very friendly and nice part of Ballard and it is withing walking distance of some lovely parks.  A favourite of ours was Salmon Bay park as there is a big sandpit there which our son loved.  The house is also within walking distance of Market Street where there are some lovely shops and restaurants. Ballard Market is definitely a must on the weekend too!  All in all we had a lovely stay :-) and the Davidson\\'s were very helpful and welcoming!\\r\\n My wife & I enjoyed our stay immensely.  The \"free breakfasts\" were fresh & exceptional (they had 4 chickens that furnished 2 Jumbo eggs daily).  Our 4 year old grand daughter visited, daily, to play in the back yard & got excited with equipment & chicks.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHope to visit again! Great house and wonderful hospitality! The Ballard neighborhood also lives up to its billing. I would definitely stay here again. We loved our stay in this wonderful Ballard home.  The furnishings and decor were charming and the quiet back patio was lovely. Erin left great instructions and suggestions for enjoying the neighborhood - (don\\'t miss Sunset Park! ) and got back to us right away when we had a question.  The location is within walking distance of central Ballard and we were happy to park the car and enjoy walking out to dinner, etc.  We would love to return here on our next visit to Seattle. Oh, and the blue hydrangea was stunning! Erin was a perfect hostess! Very comfortable and clean, easy to find, and speedy communication. She left recommendations for food, clear instructions about the house, and some great Seattle welcome gear. Pinch the cat is around the house and likes to share the bed, but is a sweet and funny host and is not in the way. I would definitely return to Erins house! An adorable Ballard home in a fantastic neighborhood!  My friends and I had all previously lived in Seattle so we really just needed a home base, and this house was perfect.  The location offers close proximity to a bus line that goes to downtown, there\\'s ample on-street parking, and there are many restaurants and bars within walking distance.\\r\\nThe decor is not only lovely, but comfortable.  The home cozy and enjoyable. We loved this little house! It is a nicely updated 1920\\'s home with a lovely period feel. The kitchen is a dream to work in due it\\'s layout and all the appliances and utensils you need. Everything is so bright and homey. We stayed with our two teenage daughters and there was plenty of space. It is close to the funky shopping areas and good restaurants. We have stayed in downtown Seattle but much preferred the neighbourhood feel of Ballard. And sweet cat, Pinch, was a pleasure to have around. We want to come back again.  The Charming Craftsman Ballard was exactly (email hidden)arming!  The neighborhood was perfect for a first Seattle experience.  We loved the quaint kitchen and being able to barbeque and dining al fresco.  Erin\\'s instructions were thorough and she was very responsive to any requests for information.  There was definite attention to detail in making guests comfortable with wonderful art on the wall, excellent book collection and welcoming flowers.  Pinch was a pleasure to share the house with.  A lovely experience. Erin\\'s listing was just as described. Her charming home was lit and welcoming to our small wedding party. The wider street before the home accommodated our parking needs. Every bed was comfortable, the kitchen is well-stocked, and house and yard are decorated with loving detail. Eco-conscious, with a loving cat weaving in and out of the home, we left with sweet memories. This house is a treasure in Ballard, centrally located for exploring...or attending your daughter\\'s wedding.  Erin was very quick to respond and was a great host! The house was in a perfect location and was absolutely perfect for what we needed. The bathroom lacked shelf/counter space, which wasn\\'t a huge deal for us because we are used to small bathrooms. We would definitely recommend this house for a great weekend in Ballard! The house was cute and clean! Erin was very accommodating with negotiating the check out time since check in is somewhat later at 6pm. The only problem was that Erin didn\\'t mention that the house behind is under construction, and we woke up at 7:30am with hammering and staple guns right outside of the master bedroom window. The construction is also not shown in the posted pictures. Not a very relaxing getaway. We enjoyed our stay in Charming Craftsman in Ballard. The house was clean and as advertised with three good sized bedrooms. Erin left us with a bottle of wine which was a very nice gesture. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the seattle area. The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. What a wonderful place to stay. Warm, cozy, and very comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay and look forward to visiting again. The space was just as advertised: cozy, comfortable, and had everything I needed for a relaxing stay. The decor was accommodating, including a good couch and a super comfy bed, along with a fridge and nice mini-kitchen area. The apartment itself is separate from the main house, so it\\'s completely private. And it\\'s in a great neighborhood, only a five minute drive to some great shops and restaurants along Ballard Ave and Market Street. (If you\\'re looking for a cool little neighborhood tavern, I recommend a fun, old school bar called Hattie\\'s Hat. Great food and atmosphere.)\\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely recommend Tim\\'s backyard bungalow to anyone visiting from out of town; it\\'s a great place to relax and explore one of the great old areas of Seattle. Tim and his wife were excellent hosts. Didn\\'t get a chance to meet them, but they were more than easy to communicate with over text. My girlfriend and I were stranded in Seattle and they were able accommodate us last minute. Not only that but their place is well equipped and very cozy on a rainy Seattle eve. Highly recommend! Tim and Kelly answered all our questions and offered to provide anything we needed.  The bungalow is clean, comfortable, and cozy.  The kitchenette is well equipped for preparing simple meals. We enjoyed runs and walks around the neighborhood.  This is an excellent value and we will definitely stay here again.  Maria and her husband were very friendly and welcoming. I especially liked the welcome beer they placed in the fridge for me. The rooms are newly renovated and very cosy. The neighbourhood is very quite and seems safe. There was even a shakespear performance in the park across the street. Maria and Paul\\'s place was a great stay and just what my friend and I needed for our trip to Seattle for CHBP. Everything was super clean and comfortable. Maria and Paul greeted us when we arrived, provided us with everything we needed and then some - snacks, coffee and breakfast for the morning, cold waters and even a few beers in the fridge. Overall a really pleasant experience.  This was a great space, quite, cool and clean.\\xa0\\n\\nWhen we first arrived we we’re not sure what door to knock on, so we went towards the back as we had mentioned checking in at 3. Maria was a feeling a bit under the weather, but was super nice and helpful, gave us a quick tour, showed us where the cold beers and snacks were and that was the end of our interaction while there (which was totally cool with us).\\n\\nThe place is very nice and clean. The entry way has a nice table to sit and drink a cup of coffee. But I think the upstairs is the gem of this place. Very well lit, and it has a nice closet and plenty of space. There is no AC and we were there in probably the hottest day in Seattle, but just the windows open, really air the room and keep it really cool. There is a park pretty much across the street some on a weekend you hear some people/kids playing, and there was a concert at the park or something one of the nights but it wasn’t bad. Whlist the bedrooms and the entry are great, the bathroom and sitting/dresing room are really shallow, the ceilings are really low. I am 6’2” and I think the highest point of these might be 6’3”… the bathroom is small but very functional, if you are below 5’9” you might not feel at cramped.\\xa0\\n\\nOver all the place is nice, and Maria was great.\\xa0 My stay with Maria was great! So hospitable and the place was clean and very comfortable. Maria was so sweet and accommodating! We had a great stay at Marias house. The place is clean and very cozy. Bed is super comfy. The Ballard area offers a lot of great restaurants and bars. Would definitely return! Delightful space. It was clean and tastefully decorated. The space offered more room that I originally thought, not cramped at all. The location was central to all the things we wanted to visit while in Seattle. The location was in a very quiet neighborhood. Maria was very helpful and was a great host. Nice touches like wine and snack items in the fridge were great after hours on the road but not quite dinner time. I look forward to staying with Maria when I return to Seattle next.  Great place. So nice in fact we extended our stay a second day. Maria left us wine, beer, and water in the fridge and greeted us on the steps with a loaner umbrella as we rushed into the city for various activities.  We loved our stay in Ballard!  The adorable suite was well-stocked with beverages and snacks which we so enjoyed.  And since I had mentioned liking live folk music venues, Maria left us a suggestion for a show in the neighbourhood which we ended up checking out.  So great being within walking distance to the entertainment district of Ballard! Checking in and out was seamless and easy even though we did not meet our hosts face-to-face.  And the place was immaculate and comfortable.  This will definitely be a go-to place in Seattle from now on...   We traveled to Seattle for a week and stayed in 3 different areas with different Airbnb hosts throughout our journey.  Maria\\'s little apartment was our favorite by far! She was a great host leaving us a kind note upon our arrival with everything we needed to know as well as some eggs, granola bars, apples, yogurt, a bottle of wine and plenty of bottled water in the fridge.  And that bed - super comfy! Although we never ran into her throughout our stay, she was great about staying in touch via email and they\\'re location is pretty convenient to everything.  We will definitely be recommending her space to others who travel to Seattle.  \\r\\n\\r\\nJust an FYI, the ceilings are very low as this is an extended apartment to a house if you are a tall person (Not low enough to have to duck anywhere except maybe door frames)!  Luckily I\\'m only 5\\'1\\'\\'!  This was my first Airbnb experience and I swear this is the only way I will travel from now on. While I didn\\'t get a chance to meet Maria, she was very warm and welcoming in the way she set up her adorable home for us. I especially appreciated the delicious homemade muffins and yogurt that we got to enjoy before rushing off to explore in the morning. It is a sweet home in a charming neighborhood perfect for experiencing the lovely town of Ballard. Overall, it was exactly what we were looking for and I would recommend it to anyone! Great spot, Maria was very helpful and communicative. The place is well stocked, sunny and in a good part of town. We were expecting a standalone house, but this was more of a half-house, or duplex, where the other half is being remodeled.  The space was nice and mostly new, but the only thing separating the private space was a door leaning up against a doorway so sounds could easily travel through.  At night (9p) while in bed we heard what sounded like someone coming into our space through the main door twice, but I believe that they were actually going into the part under remodel.  It did scare us at first, then we heard someone letting a dog out and moving furniture in the other space.  I\\'m sure that since the remodel is ongoing that this situation will be remedied quickly and it might have been a one-time experience, but you might want to ask the host to make sure.  Maria was really nice.  When we visited, the kitchen was just a fridge and microwave too, but sink/water is coming as well.  The area is close to Market St for eating/shopping and you can rent bikes at Dutch Bikes down there too.  The park across the street is really nice and you can easily take the 18 or 40 bus to downtown for a few bucks. Maria was great and the most welcoming host I\\'ve had so far on Airbnb. She left muffins, yogurt, bottled water, wine, juice boxes, candy, popcorn, - the whole gamut - for us and restocked it each day so we never ran low. She also loaned her bikes to us (although we never got a chance to ride it around, a pity!) as well as her umbrella. I was so impressed by her (website hidden), the only \"downsides\" are the quirks to the house which did not affect the quality of our stay at all: low ceilings, bathroom can be a tight squeeze, and they\\'re still renovating the other side of the house (they never worked on it while we were staying there). As I said, this did not affect our stay because we were mostly only back there to sleep. As for the neighborhood, it was really safe and only a block away from a park which was a treat. Thanks Maria!   We really enjoyed staying at Maria\\'s home. It was a nice getaway for my sister\\'s bachelorette party. We had fun going to the restaurants and bars in downtown Ballard which was only a 10 or so blocks away from the house. Maria left us lots of snacks and made our visit very comfortable.  Maria greeted us as if we were family coming for a visit.  She had added extras to the suite for us such as some breakfast items and a bottle of wine.  When Maria heard that we were \"foodies\" she placed some interesting cookbooks for us to peruse.  We were very comfortable. Maria and Paul\\'s flat is very clean and the bed is extremely comfortable! There were lovely muffins and yoghurt in the fridge and an excellent coffee maker that I took full advantage of. The neighborhood is residential and as per Maria\\'s suggestion, I rented a car to get myself around, including going into the high street of Ballard, a very charming area with a lot of restaurants and shops.  Driving into downtown Seattle only took about 15 min during the weekend which was faster than I expected. Thanks to Maria for providing a detailed map and other information that was very helpful. I didn\\'t get a chance to ride a bike, but I did see a bike helmet which is good to have. \\r\\n\\r\\nA wonderful stay- I would stay there again (but hopefully won\\'t have to leave at 6am to catch a flight!). Thanks!  Maria was welcoming and enthusiastic about our visit.  We never met but she made sure my daughter and I found our way and had everything we needed.  The house is in a quiet, charming Ballard neighborhood, good for a restful sleep.  A separate entrance and kitchenette make it perfect for visitors looking for something homey but private.   Maria was a wonderful host! She provided wonderful touches such as a bottle of wine and homemade bread that made our stay even more memorable. She had amazing communication, which made settling in very easy and stress free. The neighborhood was very quiet and absolutely charming. The rental itself was clean, cute, incredibly comfortable and exactly what I envisioned. I would not hesitate to recommend this rental, and if I am ever in need of a place to stay in Ballard, I would rent from Maria again.   Staying with Maria has been the ultimately positive AirBNB experience: Easy communication, extremely cozy and perfectly clean rooms and Maria has been more than the perfect host. Before we arrived she let us know that she had baked and had left some for us in the fridge. Special requests from our side were no problem at all and throughout the whole experience we just felt ... happy! Would stay with Maria again in a heartbeat! I had a wonderful experience w/ Maria. She was extremely welcoming and really went above and beyond. She left snacks and wine, water bottles, and even fresh cut flowers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment was very charming and in a lovely neighborhood. It was very clean and roomy. I will absolutely stay w/ Maria the next time I\\'m in Seattle. She was wonderful and the accomodations were great.  I stayed here for one night and what a wonderful night it was. Maria left me clear instructions on how to get in and out of the apartment which were very easy to follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon arrival into the apartment, my girlfriend and I were greeted with a plethora of goodies from a jar of M&Ms, a bottle of wine, yogurt, oatmeal, water, and a Keurig for coffee. In addition was a list of all the local restaurants in downtown. We ended up going to the Bastille, which was delicious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment was spacious enough with 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, 1 meditation room and the half-kitchen downstairs. The only con I would say is that the ceilings are rather low, so anyone 6 foot or over might have to hunch down going through doorways, but that didn\\'t affect me too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, the area is very safe and welcoming. My girlfriend and I went for an enjoyable night run to Golden Gardens Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaria and her husband even left us a couple bikes to use upon request. We didn\\'t end up using them, but it was very thoughtful nonetheless. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to anyone else wanting to stay in the Ballard area. Maria made us feel welcome with informative preliminary emails with directions and a personal note and convenient snacks upon arrival. My husband and I had a great stay in Ballard.   Maria was wonderful, she even left a bottle of wine :)   I would definitely stay again!  Maria was great!  We had snacks and wine waiting upon arrival and the apartment was very clean.  She was very sweet and accommodating - very easy to work with!  Great location for those looking for a getaway in Ballard!  Beautiful views from the dressing room!  Maria was wonderful. We needed a place at the last minute and she communicated with us immediately and consistently. The place was very neat and tidy and the blueberry bread, well what we didn\\'t finish I took home. The main bedroom is upstairs and very conducive to just staying in bed and chatting with the sun streaming in. Thanks for a fine time. Maria was a thoughtful and caring host. She went above and beyond in making sure we got in safely and even baked us a delicious homemade cranberry loaf. Her place was a welcoming and warm haven.  Maria was an incredibly generous host. She was very quick to respond and personalized our experience for us. Her home is beautiful and is very cozy. I would highly recommend anyone stay here! Maria is a welcoming and responsive host.  Breakfasts, fruit, snacks and drinks (coffee, tea, water and wine!) were provided.  The apartment was as described on the Airbnb site.  Maria is a very warm and helpful host.  I would definitely consider a return visit! Maria was an incredibly welcoming host!  Her place was extremely clean & comfortable and more space than I needed for my several night stay.  There were fresh flowers, fresh fruit, a bottle of wine, a Keurig with coffee and tea, fresh blueberry bread plus yogurt & juice in the fridge.  Everything I needed to get going in the morning!  \\r\\nMaria was also helpful with restaurant suggestions and directions to where I needed to go.\\r\\nThis was my first experience with Air BnB and it definitely exceeded my expectations. We had a fantastic time at Maria\\'s place in Seattle.  Maria is lovely, welcoming, and helpful.  The space is warm and cozy, and the bed is very comfortable.  The location is great - 15 minute walk to Ballard downtown and close to buses. Would definitely stay there again!  the Host was very nice. Welcomed us with a bottle of wine and some fruit. It is an up stairs property enter from the side of the house. All new inside with nice charm.  Fantastic location, gracious host, plenty of amenities and special greeting gifts. We\\'ll definitely stay here again and highly recommend. The space was cozy and well appointed, they even left treats for us! We had a great stay, and would recommend the space, but i should point out that the ceiling in the bathroom was a bit low for a man over 6 feet tall...  Maria made us feel so welcome, with communication and pics beforehand about getting in, presents like chocolate and wine and coffee (totally awesome and unexpected!), a handwritten note with the wifi info, and checking in on us to make sure we had everything we needed. The listing was exactly as posted, we were very comfy in the place, the garden was adorable, the neighborhood is cozy and convenient to Ballard... everything was perfect! Can\\'t say enough good things about staying here! Very enjoyable. water, fruits and coffee was available. Maria was a wonderful host.  Her accommodations were clean and cozy, inside and out.  It had an old cottage feel and was quite peaceful.  The neighborhood was quiet and located across from a park with a walking path.   My partner was reluctant to try Air BNB and he was quite impressed.   He said that he felt that Maria\\'s place was warm and comfortable, and he stated that he would definitely like to return when we are next in Seattle.  \\r\\nMaria checked in by text while we were there to make sure that the accommodations were suitable and that we had everything we needed.  Her instructions related to directions and accommodations were specific and accurate, which I appreciated.  She left a binder with maps and area activities/restaurants which we found helpful. I was quite impressed and pleased and I look forward to returning.     What can I say....Maria is a super host.  As an Airbnb hostess myself, she is what I strive to be! \\r\\n\\r\\nMaria is incredibly welcoming and optimized every aspect of our stay.   The house was beautiful and cosy with comfortable beds.  We were greeted with a bottle of wine and chocolates.  And she made up an extra bed for my sister when she needed a last minute place to stay.   The fridge was stocked with fresh fruit plus yogurt & juice.  We never went out for breakfast! And you have your own private garden to enjoy your breakfast.  Maria texted us halfway through our stay to let us know that she had made us a delicious loaf of pumpkin and cranberry bread.  \\r\\nThe house is about a 10 min walk or quick drive to Ballard which is a really fun neighborhood - bars, thrift stores, and more. Check out Porkchop and Co.  Delicious! \\r\\nThis was my best experience with Airbnb thanks to Maria\\'s hostessing skills. Maria was very helpful during my stay.  Provided some breakfast items and bottled water.  Microwave and mini fridge available for use.  There are two rooms upstairs to use, so plenty of space; but fully private.  Maria leaves plenty of guidebooks and has plenty of suggestions for things to do in the city and around ballard.  Just about a mile walk to the main streets in ballard.  Would recommend to anyone, and would recommend to rent a car while in Seattle.   As everyone seems to agree Maria is an excellent host!  She made up an extra bed for me and my husband when we came to drop off our 20 year old daughter for her summer internship in Seattle.  She had the fridge stocked with all her favorite things including diet coke.  She made sure that we understood how to get into town ( a lovely 10 min. walk from her house) , how to get to her internship, the best restaurants, and explained bus routes.  \\r\\n\\r\\nShe went above and beyond what a host is supposed to do and if I lived in Seattle I know we would be friends.  She made my daughter feel safe and looked after her for five weeks including taking her grocery shopping and making sure she was ok when she didn’t feel well.  On a particularly hot night- Maria put an air conditioning unit in my daughters room.  She is an excellent communicator and we texted throughout my daughters stay.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHer home is in a very safe neighborhood and Ballard is a great town with a movie theater, many restaurants and shops, a few gyms , coffee shops and plenty of charm. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe space is clean , private,  and it actually nicer in person than in the pictures.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a great experience! \\r\\n Maria was an amazing host. Everything was set up so nicely at her house, and she left us a wonderful spread of yogurts, juice, water, coffee and much more. She made us feel so welcome there, and  even though we were technically in her house, the whole experience was very private with a separate entrance and living quarters. The place was clean, spacious and decorated beautifully. Our best Airbnb experience yet! My husband and I stayed at this beautiful, quaint residence for 3 nights and had a wonderful experience. This was our first Air BNB experience and without doubt,  we were impressed. Maria and her husband were great hosts, providing us with a high level of comfort before arriving. The house was cosy, fresh, and provided the right amount of space for the two of us. The best part of this summer visit was the bit of outdoor space to enjoy our morning coffee and cocktail hour in the afternoon. I would absolutely stay here again.  Maria was beyond considerate. She was accommodating and quick to offer recommendations. I enjoyed feeling at home because she had a variety of goodies stocked for us and checked in with us, in the sweetest way. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe place was clean and cozy! I love staying at a place that I can tell is cared for.  we had such a great time at marias place. it is really beautiful, supercomfy, spotlessly clean, green and yet only a 10 minutes drive from downtown. ballard has its own nice and special atmosphere and even a small beach nearby.\\nmaria was so sweet and helped me so much when my baggage went missing on the flight to seattle. moreover she stocked the fridge with tasty joghurt, juice and water and treated us with a bottle of wine which we enjoyed very much sitting out in the small garden.\\ni can only recommend marias home to everybody.\\nmaria, thank you again for everything! franciska and lukas We had such a lovely stay in Ballard.  This was our first Airbnb experience and it was just perfect!  Maria was a wonderful host and left lots of treats for us to snack on and even a fancy beer in the fridge for my husbands birthday.  The accommodations were perfect and even better than we expected.  Super comfy bed and great location close to everything.  Maria  even left us bikes to ride which was great because we didn\\'t rent a car and got around just fine on bikes and bus.    I would highly recommend staying here and really enjoyed my time.  Maria is just lovely and very thoughtful and I\\'m sure we would be friends if I lived in Seattle. This is the perfect place to stay for exploring Ballard and the rest of Seattle. Cute and comfy. Maria makes you feel right at home. María is a wonderful host and I would gladly stay at her place  if I come back to Seattle.  This was my first AirBNB experience and Maria made it absolutely wonderful.  Her home was exactly as described and in the pictures...very clean and comfortable.  It is also in a very safe area with plenty of street parking.  She had water, juice, yogurt, coffee, and other treats available to us upon arriving.  She recommended and even provided books/magazines for places to see and check out in Ballard/Bellevue/Seattle.  She is just an amazing host!  I would definitely recommend her and I would definitely book my next stay with her in Seattle.  Thank you again Maria!   Maria was a wonderful host! The space was exactly as described, with lots of light available in the front reading room and bedroom.  Its in a quiet residential neighborhood with a great park across the street, walking distance to Old Ballard, and within an easy drive to key Seattle sites.   We did not have much time for sightseeing during our visit, but Maria provides a lot of great material for anyone who wanted to know what to do in the city and lots of special treats for her guests - we were even greeted with chocolates, nuts, wine, and other goodies! Another key feature of our stay was the fact that Maria was very accommodating and helpful; she was in contact with us the day we arrived, responded quickly to our text messages, and she even offered her iron and ironing board without us asking (as we were attending a wedding that first night).  One warning, though, is that the bathroom has a low ceiling - which was not a problem for me - but may be a bit close for anyone 6\\' plus. Wonderful stay in Ballard! We never got the chance to meet Maria as we were on the go, but she was absolutely lovely to communicate with and the space was perfect for us (plus she had stocked the fridge!)!! Would highly recommend! Maria was incredibly accommodating and thoughtful. She was also very detailed, which I appreciate! The space was clean, cozy, and as expected. I would absolutely recommend Maria\\'s place to anyone who\\'s looking for a place to stay in Ballard! Maria was kind and thoughtful. She baked us some pumpkin bread and left us snacks and beverages. Her place is clean and located in a great neighborhood. Maria was a fantastic host. She made us feel welcome in a new city and even left us snacks, water and home made pumpkin bread. Her home was cozy and exactly as described. It was in a nice, safe neighborhood with easy parking and I felt very much at home. My wife and I were so busy we ended up not actually meeting Maria in person, unfortunately, but my interactions with her over the phone were extremely pleasant. She was helpful and proactive about making sure we were having a great time. Her home is in the perfect part of Seattle and it took only a few minutes to get anywhere we wanted to go. If you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle, Maria has it!  Maria was an incredible host. She was very available for all our needs and, as others have mentioned, baked delicious pumpkin bread as well as stocking drinks and a few snacks, including some delicious local chocolate. Such a sweet surprise. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe place was as described! It\\'s very charming and perfectly located to get anywhere in Ballard in a few minutes. The kitchenette is downstairs where you enter, and then indoor stairs lead up to a hallway with two bedrooms and a bathroom, with one of these bedrooms set up as a cozy sitting room with beautiful windows and neighborhood views. The ceilings and doorframes are quite low upstairs, just be aware that if you\\'re six feet like my husband you\\'ll duck a bit through the doorways!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bed and couch were super comfy and Maria provided a few lovely toiletries as well. The park across the street is absolutely gorgeous. We hope to stay here again! Fantastic experience staying at maria\\'s, very well looked after and had everything I needed. Would recommend!  The host canceled this reservation 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. The house was adorable & the perfect setting for a girls night. It was comfy & we had a great time. Sabrina answered my questions quickly & was very accommodating. She even left a birthday greeting on the door for my sister. We would definitely stay here again. Wonderful house and wonderful host!  Sabrina was very responsive and made the stay very enjoyable ! It was a great place and Sabrina was extremely kind and easy to deal with. Would love to stay again. Seahawks lost so that was a bummer.  Great location, very easy to find. The house is very warm and welcoming and we enjoyed our stay. My daughter and I were welcomed with a bottle of wine and lovely note to start off our Mother/Daughter weekend. The house was perfect for our stay. Ballard has great restaurants and the house is close to downtown. We were delighted with this property!  We had a great experience at Sabrina\\'s home. It fit our family nicely! She had a lot to offer in the kitchen, in terms of utensils and cookware. Very cute and homey!  Even I didn\\'t have chance to meet Daminda, he answered my question very quickly. His house is just like as described. Located in one of my favorite neighborhood in Seattle.   Good neighbourhood. Would recommend a car to get there. Friendly Host. Private bedroom adjacent to shared bathroom. The air mattress, though unexpected from the description, was comfortable. We only stayed one night but the kitchen and bedroom were equipped with amenities for a longer stay. This was a great place for our quick stay in Seattle. Daminda was great at communication prior and during our stay. We didn\\'t see him a lot because we were out in town most of each day. It was really hot while we were there and he even picked up a fan for us! Location is a bit removed, but a great spot if you have a car, parking always easy. The airbed isn\\'t amazing but okay for a few nights stay. Lots of people in the house so sharing one bathroom can get a bit hectic, but overall everything was good. Super clean place. Daminda is gracious and very friendly and the room was generally as advertised. Communications were smooth. Guests booking should be aware that it is an air mattress and the room cannot be locked. Otherwise it provided reasonable value in a city where accomodation is generally expensive.  Thanks Daminda. We did not meet our host and received our key from a key box.  The neighborhood was quiet.  The room was clean and the bed very comfortable.  A basic room just as pictured. Daminda\\'s home was so clean, comfortable and conveniently located. He was incredibly sweet throughout our stay there. I was there for work and very busy, so it was really nice to wake up to a note offering us coffee some mornings.  The room was very nice and the brand new mattress was extremely comfortable. He did a fantastic job communicating and everything anyone could need in the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom was all there! Thank you so much Daminda! Daminda fue un excelente anfitrión. Nos sentimos cómodos y bienvenidos. El vecindario muy bonito y muy bien comunicado con el centro de la ciudad de Seattle. I didn\\'t get to meet Daminda but we communicated a lot through text and she gave my boyfriend and I plenty of advice on what to see and do. It was a good area to stay in because there is street parking and restaurants and cafes are just a short drive away. The room is nice and enough space for two. There was also chips and water bottles which we really appreciated! Personally we didn\\'t prefer the bed and the walls are quite thin.  The room was as described. The shared bathroom was available at most times and stayed clean. It was great to have a kitchen to use, and a nice little deck to sit out on. The host is committed to upgrading and definitely interested in feedback. The space feels very private. It is a block away from the best bus route in Seattle, so it\\'s easy to get around. Get on the bus and go straight to Pike\\'s Place Market and downtown Seattle. Daminda was very welcoming. He came to the house a number of times during our stay there , and made sure we were feeling comfortable. He is very kind, and disposes of his time to help you get around the area or to make any accommodations that meet your needs.We were free to use other areas of the house, and he made sure to let us know so. The neighborhood is very quite and safe. We were able to sit out on the balcony a few times, and was very peaceful and quite. We found the house to be in a convenient location as well. There\\'s a coffee  shop a couple of blocks away, and a number of good restaurants within a mile range.  Daminda was a friendly, excellent host! He really made our stay in Seattle a great one. The location of his place in Ballard makes walking to many great coffee shops, bar, and the D line (main line to downtown) very convenient. Also his place is a quick walk to Enterprise if you plan on renting a car!  \\r\\n\\r\\nI will definitely book with Daminda again if ever in Seattle.  Daminda\\'s place is clean and welcoming. Close to the liveliness of Ballard it is a nice spot to come home to. He made it very easy to access and I\\'d stay with him again! Very clean, very cozy, awesome neighborhood  Beautiful spankin new home in a hip, safe part of town. I don\\'t think the pictures do it (website hidden) was a very accommodating host and great to communicate with for last minute needs. Definitely hope to stay here again next time I come to Seattle! Steve\\'s place was perfect for me.  I was in Ballard for work and it was walking distance for me.  I was able to enjoy lots of great restaurants, and desserts...top of my list were the Molten Cake place, Red Mill Burgers, Morsel and Bean as well as the Locks where there were huge birds dive fishing for salmon swimming up stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteve is easy going and easy to communicate with.  His place is close to lots of indie shops and public transportation.  I had the bottom floor for myself and a private restroom.  The house was clean.  I would definitely stay here when back in town. Steve was a great host that helped me figure out how to navigate Airbnb for my first stay, and based on this experience, I would definitely love to stay at his place again! Steve\\'s house is brand new and situated in a great location that allowed us to walk to everything in Ballard, and it was a quick drive to downtown Seattle.  My fiance loved the neighborhood so much, we were thinking about possibly moving there!  Steve was friendly and accommodating, and he effortlessly balanced being a good host while helping us with any questions, as well as giving us great recommendations of places to visit.   Steve\\'s home is a brand new and modern construction, so the room and bathroom fittings are contemporary and very nice. The location in Ballard, north of Market and just off 24th, is residential and quiet, with ample street parking right near the house. The bus stop to Downtown and the main road in Ballard is a couple minutes walk, so overall it\\'s very conveniently located. At the time I stayed, Steve hadn\\'t yet had wifi installed, and FYI, the 2 coffee shops that are closest by also both don\\'t have wifi, which is strange for Seattle. The bed is comfortable and Steve kindly also left some bottles of water on my arrival. Water pressure in the shower is good and it\\'s also nice to have the option of taking a bath. Steve has a few rules for keeping his house clean and safe (no shoes inside, lock the dual locks, don\\'t open the window too wide, etc), so I\\'d recommend talking through those so you have the same expectations. Steve is a great guy & his place is in a great location! Only a short stroll from all the good restaurants, bars & shops in Ballard. We had a whole floor to ourselves...the place is brand new & very clean! Perfect It was fine. Clean and simple. sung Joon was accommodating and helpful.  Host:\\nHe helped me to figure out how to get to his place and welcomed me wholeheartedly. He is really easy to communicate and easy going. \\n\\nHouse:\\nThe house looked like brand new with modern construction, I asked to host when this house has been built. He said it was built in June 2015. So, it is clean and nice hose to stay. It is same as on the description, but much better than photo you see on this post. I think Steve should do another photo works to show this place in more attractive way. :)\\nI could use whole first floor with private bathroom, so level of private was pretty good. \\n\\nTown:\\nThis house is located in downtown Ballard. That\\'s one of the main reason why I choose this place. It\\'s only 15 minutes walk distance to there, and there were many soulful cafe, restaurant, theater, bar and shops. I could definitely enjoy the town. Steve is accommodating and polite host. The room is in the very nice, clean brand new building and comes with private bathroom. It is in the Ballard neighborhood, which is quite, safe and cozy location with ample nice coffee shops and restaurants. We would definitely stay at this place in the future. Sung made us feel  very welcome. The apartment is ideally situated in Ballard, as advertised. The actual room is a little bit small, but it\\'s ideal for a person or two staying for a short stay. The building itself is very modern and clean.  I had a wonderful stay at Steve’s place. Steve is a very nice guy and a wonderful host. His house is clean, quiet and is conveniently located in Ballard. The rooms that are available to me are exactly as described/pictured. In addition, he left lovely welcome gifts (bottles of water and a couple of bags of Kukuruza popcorn) on the bed :). I had the bottom floor to myself with private bathroom, and during my stay I hardly heard any foot/floor noises from the floors above. If you are a light sleeper, this is the place for you! I highly recommend Steve’s place and will definitely book here again. Steve was such a great host. Our flight arrived late and he stayed up and got us settled right in despite the hour! The room was extremely clean and we felt very comfortable staying with him. The shared space was lovely and Steve gave us some great suggestions for visiting Seattle. I actually loved being in the Ballard neighborhood and found it to be a lot of fun and easy to get in and out of Downtown, I would stay there again in a minute. This was our first experience with Air BnB and I\\'m now a huge fan. Steve was a very gracious, accommodating host. From booking to arriving, he stayed in touch, providing sightseeing and restaurant suggestions. When we arrived to his clean, well-appointed space, he had left us a half-sheet with house rules, two waters, and his favorite local artisanal popcorn. The common space separated the guest suite from his, so we felt we had enough privacy. The quiet neighborhood was only a 10-minute Über or 30-minute bus ride from downtown--though there are plenty of things to do in Ballard.  Our only regret is that we only had one night to spend here! He was very accommodating and very available. The room and bathroom was very clean and easy to access. Great experience. Steve had a couple of water bottles and sone local speciality popcorn redy for us when we arrived. Steve was a great host. The room was clean and in a great neighborhood.  He was accommodating and clear with his communication. I had a great stay!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Sung!\\r\\n\\r\\nMike Room was clean if a little minimal. Bed was very small for a couple, but overall a pleasant experience.  Steve is very welcoming, polite and friendly host. He organized and prepared everything I needed for the room. He knew that I was on a working trip and he got me a small desk for the room. I really appreciated it. The apartment is conveniently located in Ballard. I can walk to the happening spots in less than 15 mins. To get to downtown, there is a bus stop, just a block away. It takes less than 30 mins to get to downtown. As for the apartment, its a brand new building (modern style). The room and the bathroom are very clean. I have enough privacy on the first floor and the private bathroom is definitely a huge plus! The wifi connection is strong and you can find nice graphic arts hanging around his place. The neighborhood is very quite so it\\'s work out great for a light sleeper like me.  I had a wonderful stay and will definitely book here again :) Thanks Steve for being a great host! Steve was very responsive - his house was super clean and the stay was great. Nice neighborhood - close to everything - parking easy and accessible.\\r\\n Our stay at Sung Joons apartment was so nice.\\nHe is such a friendly and helpful host.\\nThe room and private bath were really great and 100 percent clean.\\nThe second floor with kitchen and living room were spacious and we had a lot of fun cooking there. \\nWe enjoyed the time and definitely recommended it. Sung Yoon made us feel welcome, and everything was nice and clean. Bed was small for two people but other than that it was great. Common area was very nice but we never used it. Bathroom was spotless too which is a big plus in my book Awesome host, nice clean and tidy apartment. Would definitely want to stay here next time.  Steve was a wonderfull host. From the moment I arrived he guided me to a private parking lot, I was excited about that. The living room looks way better in real life than in pictures, it`s simple, elegant and usefull. The room where I was hosted was on the first floor, so I had privacy, plus the bathroom was next door, so handy. \\r\\n The neighborhood was quiet, close to downtown, the perfect place for what I needed. \\r\\n I would defenetaly book a room at Steve`s if I`m going to be in Seattle ! \\r\\n\\r\\n  Absolutely amazing air BNB the space is exactly as advertised complete wonderful experience would totally stay here again.  If I could describe our stay at Steve\\'s place in three words, I\\'d have to say \"quick and easy.\" Not only was Steve very welcoming and readily available to answer questions, but his clean and tidy apartment was the perfect accommodation for two folks needing a place to spend the night on a budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nPros: Very friendly host, clean room, zero hassle, Ballard, excellent price for what is offered.\\r\\nCons: the 2 person bed is only suitable for slender folks (this wasn\\'t an issue for us)\\r\\nOverall: 5/5 All was accurate and check in and check out went smoothly Our room in Sung Joon\\'s apartment was nice but pretty small (would recommend it for one or two nights, though). It is situated in a very nice area where bars, cafés and restaurants are in walking-distance. Sung Joon was very friendly and made great suggestions of which cafés we should check out. Thanks for that! Steve was a most excellent host during our stay with him.  We felt at home and comfortable in his lovely, clean, well decorated home.  The neighborhood was quiet yet close to lots of action. A beautiful area to explore. Whatever you do, don\\'t miss the locks!\\n\\nWe highly recommend staying with Steve, he is a great host and kind as well.  Hope to see him again soon!  I had a flight that came in pretty late at night and Steve stayed up until 12:45AM waiting up for me! It was a really comfortable stay and I definitely appreciated the kind gesture of a water and towels. The room was clean and rules were simple to follow. I\\'d definitely want to stay here again! Steven was very accommodating for us to check in and was very friendly and welcoming. The place was very clean and new. I would recommend it! We stayed two nights at Steve\\'s house, what I can tell is that his place is really convenient, clean and you have the first floor just for you so you can have your intimacy. I highly recommend this bnb and this host (too bad we didn t see him much as he was busy working). Host was very helpful through out my entire stay. Quick to respond to my questions and texts. I couldn\\'t find the place but he came out to find me and direct me to the place. Good location. Convenient parking. House is clean.  Steve was really nice and friendly，and the place was warm and welcome. We stayed 2 nights at Steve\\'s. The room was exactly as described, very clean and comfortable. Steve was great too, although we did not see much of him.  The location is ideal with a bus stop 2 blocks away with downtown 30 minutes away. Ballard is also a great neighbourhood, with loads of restaurants and shops. We definitely recommend staying here. Steve is very nice, accomodating and fast to answer questions. The place is very modern,clean and close to seattle. We rented a car so the parking space available was very convenient as well. Something worth considering and will definitely stay here again when given the chance to go back to seattle :) Thanks steve warm and helpful hosting, the room is clean and new, especially guest has indepent space and can use kitchen. this     is a good experience for me to live in a airbnb room and have a opputinity with host. The room was in a great convenient area. Steve\\'s home was very clean and just as described in the pictures. He was also a very responsive host and was quick to answer any questions or concerns we had. Our primary use of this room was just for a place to sleep which worked out great. Overall a very clean and convenient location!  This was a wonderful, comfortable stay. Home was really clean, well maintained & had everything I needed. Host was very accessible by text. Places to eat & hang out were all close by as well :). Had a great experience and would definitely come again! The listing description was pretty accurate and the neighborhood around it is pretty nice and has many families around so safety concerns seem to not be an issue. Parking on the street is much easier than on the private premise offered by the host as the space and driveway is pretty narrow for normally-skilled drivers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house itself is newly constructed so everything inside seemed brand new. The host also cleans pretty well and offers very clear instructions about the stay and all other aspects of the Seattle experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are a couple, or a single person, and has a car, I would definitely recommend to stay here, particularly for its affordability, location, simple amenities, and host helpfulness. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if you don\\'t have a car, it seems like the public transportation will take about 45 min to get to downtown.  Steve was super welcoming and friendly! My week staying there was very enjoyable and he was really helpful with suggestions about Seattle and its different neighborhoods. He met me right when I arrived and was always very responsive by text. I needed to extend my stay for a couple days and was able to do this no problem. His house is super clean and comfortable, the room was warm and the bed cozy. Use of the large kitchen was appreciated and I was able to store some items in the refrigerator. Even though we didn\\'t see too much of each other because we were both quite busy, it was always a pleasure to chat for a few minutes. His place is just a 15 minute walk to many great restaurants and coffee shops, yet is in a very peaceful and quiet area. All in all this was a really great stay, and I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a clean and chill place in the Ballard neighborhood! We really enjoyed our stay with Daminda. Our room was nice and comfortable and our host was very kind and welcoming. Thank you for your great hospitality. Nice, quiet room in remodeled upper unit of house, with stylish  black and white theme.  Modest, quiet neighborhood in great location for getting around Seattle.  We had a great time at this listing in the Ballard area of Seattle. Valerie allowed us a very convenient check in and check out. The property was clean with comfortable furnishings. It was very conveniently located to the Ballard district and super easy access to downtown. We would not hesitate to stay here again. Valerie was very flexible and easy to reach. The space is very new and a great design. The location is really great if you have a car (free parking) and right on a bus line if you need to commute to downtown Seattle. The roof top deck was the best and we spent time up there every day. The master bathroom is amazing. It was nice to be some place that welcomed our dog, and the back of the townhouse is residential, so plenty of places to walk her. Just a note: this place would be terrible with anyone with mobility issues or bad knees as there are lots stairs.  What a modern, clean delightful unit.  Could not have asked for an easier transition in and out, the kitchen was fully equipped, the shower with three \"zones\" delightful and the bed and couch very comfortable.  The parking space made getting in and out a breeze.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnjoy your stay here, we certainly did.  Oh, and just three blocks up there is the best Thai restaurant and two blocks for delicious breakfasts.  What more could you ask? Valerie is a wonderful host. I had last minute changes to my travel plans and she was so helpful in finding ways to accommodate me. The listing is quite large and very modern with all the conveniences you could need. There is a great roof deck and garden which I totally took advantage of. The location itself is a short walk from beautiful parks and the water. If you are not coming with a car, 15th has plenty of public transportation and it\\'s a really quick Uber ride to Market street or Fremont. This is a wonderful place to stay in Seattle. The location is excellent. Valerie was easy to reach by text or phone. The bed is very comfortable. The rooftop and garden are beautiful. I would recommend this place for anyone wanting a comfortable place to stay in Seattle. I very much appreciated having coffee available after a long trip.  Valerie was an excellent, communicative host during the entire process. The property was lovely and we wish we could have stayed longer than two days. We had a car, which made getting around the city very easy. The bed was extremely comfortable and the entire apartment was nicely furnished. There is a lovely vegetable garden on the roof deck. Overall, an excellent AirBNB experience and we would recommend this to others. One thing to keep in mind is that the apartment does face a relativelybusy road - so if you are a light sleeper, keep this in mind. This apartment is well placed to get to the Ballard neighborhood. I would recommend Pie Bar (for pie) and Staple & Fancy (for dinner). There are lots of interesting restaurants, cafes etc. in this neighborhood. We also liked Neptune Coffee in Greenwood. Valerie was a wonderful host and provided us with everything we need while our stay at her spacious ultramodern townhouse.\\r\\nThe location was great and close to downtown Ballard where we spent most of our time. Looking forward to staying again. The house was wonderful and so was Valerie. It\\'s very close to Ballard and Fremont area. We had one issue on the first and Valerie took care of it the moment we told her. I\\'d say the only negative is if you go to the apartment in the summer the bedroom doesn\\'t have AC. But the AC in the living room is nice and ice cold. So all in all pleasant stay if recommend to anyone who wants to stay in Ballard. Very cool place, very nice host.  My husband and I went to Seattle for Labor Day weekend, and since we were bringing our small dogs, decided that an airbnb was our best bet. This was our first airbnb experience, and it was such a positive one! Valerie, our host, could not have been more accommodating, while also remaining delightfully unobtrusive. The space is great, and as others have said, the rooftop deck with garden is a lovely bonus! We didn\\'t take advantage of the grill, unfortunately. We fully plan on coming back next year. Maybe we\\'ll find time to use the grill then. :-) Thanks, Valerie! Beautiful townhouse.  Great for exploring Ballard, Fremont and Phinney Ridge areas.   The apartment/condo was really beautiful.  It was clean, warm, and very comfortable.  Everything about it was new and very modern.    The decks were great, we went to a nearby restaurant for dinner and we appreciated how Valerie was excellent in her communications with us before and after our arrival.  As I told Valerie, we were on a \"long walk\", and walked to the apartment, arriving late in the day, and left early the next day (stopping at a nearby delicious pancake place for breakfast!) for another day of walking.  My only regret is that we didn\\'t get to linger longer in the apartment!  It was cozy and warm, and perfect.  Thank you Valerie for accommodating us and letting the kids use your air mattresses in the living room!  We all enjoyed your apartment, your clear communications via text/emails, and our visit to Ballard!  Becky and Len were great hosts. They were super friendly, nice, and accommodating. They were flexible with our check in/out times which was super helpful for us. The house was comfortable and clean. I would be happy to stay with them again.  We contacted Becky and Len as we arrived and let ourselves in as they were out. After playing with their two beautiful kittens, we unpacked. Becky and Len were amazingly friendly and accommodating. They had many recommendations for local restaurants and made us feel at home. The basement was very spacious and warm. Would stay again 100%!  We arrived very late at Becky\\'s place, which was not a problem at all. We even got breakfast offered and both, Becky and Len offered us to use the entire house. We felt very welcome at their place. Both were great Hosts and  are awesome people to meet. Would always recommend to stay with them when visiting Seattle.  Jed and Megan were wonderful hosts and we extremely enjoyed staying at their place (so much that we didn\\'t go out once - or twice)\\r\\nThe house is newly built so everything is new and everything is kept in pristine condition from kitchen to living room.\\r\\nThey have a gym which is great and the bus to Downtown couldn\\'t be more convenient.\\r\\nAny shopping can be done by walking a max of 10 minutes and their kitchen has everything you could ever need.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir cats are the gentlest and cutest cats ever - we\\'re already missing them. (This comes from someone who\\'s usually not the biggest fan)\\r\\n\\r\\nI could just recommend anyone to stay at Jed\\'s place.  Checking in and out with Megan was easy. She was friendly and welcoming.\\r\\nThe room and bathroom were clean and comfortable. It was nice to have the use of the kitchen for a quick breakfast. This was our first airbnb experience and we were very happy with everything. Jed and his wife Megan were very friendly and provided great restaurant suggestions. The room was spotless and comfortable. We selected Jed\\'s house based on its Ballard location and enjoyed the neighborhood feel and easy walk to restaurants.   We consider our stay at Jed and Megan\\'s home our favorite spot since using airbnb! Their home is modern and beautifully kept, the neighborhood was fun and we were made to feel extremely welcomed and comfortable. We highly recommend staying there! We had a great stay at Jed and Megan\\'s. Their house is in the perfect location. Finding parking nearby was no problem. We were able to walk to restaurants, shops, and the Ballard Farmers Market within 15-20 minutes. A bus stop, which makes frequent stops heading downtown, is within a few blocks. The whole house was clean and well kept. The bed was very comfy and we enjoyed the wine and snacks they provided on arrival. Their two cats are friendly, quiet, and well-mannered.  The room was very clean and sunny. It was great to have our own bathroom. Jed was kind enough to let us store our bicycles in the garage overnight.  Jed was flexible with our itinerary and got back to us right away when messaging. The house was close to Ballard and we absolutely loved the cats, they were super friendly. Overall a very nice stay! Kate and Danny go the extra mile to make your stay fantastic. The space is a perfect launching pad for your exploration of Ballard and Seattle. Quiet, clean and comfortable with lots of extra touches and charm. We stayed in the space for a friends 40th bday celebration. Kate left a sweet card, chocolate and wine! Much more than a place to sleep.  I booked this suite just a few days before my parents arrived to visit me in Seattle. Kate and Danny have been so helpful and organized everything in such a short time. The place is really great and everything was so clean. My parents had a really great time there and I would definetly recommend it to friends or other families. Thank you so much again Kate and Danny! What fantastic hosts they have thought of everything.  It\\'s a great neighborhood, easy parking and easy to walk to bars and restaurants.  The guest suite is beautiful, clean and to everyone\\'s taste.  I highly recommend it and will be back again.  Thank you both for a wonderful stay. I had a great stay at Kate and Danny\\'s  suite in Ballard. Their communication was quick and clear. The unit was super clean with plenty of space to spread out. Coffee and snacks were provided and was a nice value add. The location in Ballard is superb, but the hi light was the warm cookies left by the door on Thursday! \\nI would definitely stay here again. Kate and Danny were incredibly sweet and friendly and excellent hosts for my friend and I! The neighborhood is great, parking is super easy, and the space is really nice and clean. It was perfect for the two of us with a queen bed and futon.  I highly recommend this private suite. Kate and Danny are exceptional people.\\r\\nThey are genuinely invested in their guests. They live in a great neighborhood and they have a spacious, comfortable, quiet suite to share. They provided snacks and drinks and gave me a gift certificate and coupons to a local businesses.\\r\\nKate and Danny helped me with catching the bus (about 35 min. from downtown), directions, airport transport and check-in. One evening I came home to fresh chocolate chip cookies!! It doesn\\'t get any better than this!\\r\\nI regard Kate and Danny as friends and would come back without hesitation.\\r\\n   Excellent Hosts! It was like we had our own private suite in Ballard. great Location, plenty of parking and very comfortable. Kate and Danny were so welcoming, accommodating and generous. Thank you so much for a great AirBnb experience. I would definitely recommend this place and will most likely stay here again next time we are in Seattle :) Thanks guys! See you next time. It was a great place to stay. Both Kate and Danny were very nice and responsive during the entire process and helpful exploring the city they love. Everything was clean and as explained in posting. The area the house is in is a short walk from a great shopping, food, and late night. I could continue but all of the experience was great.  Kate and Danny were very warm and inviting hosts! Their place was very clean and spacious and we really appreciated the added bonuses like breakfast items and the Keurig coffee! Their house is in a great location and we enjoyed exploring that area of Seattle. We would not hesitate to stay there again when we visit Seattle! Thanks again! We enjoyed our few nights in their home. It was tidy and had water, oatmeal bars and fresh fruit in the other room.\\n\\nIt was private, cosy and in a good location. Close to Delancey and The Fat Hen and a lovely bakery! The bus stop was quite close, too which was convenient.\\n\\nThey kindly gave us some Lyft discount cards and asked if we needed anything to make our stay more enjoyable.\\n\\nWe would stay again!\\n\\nThanks guys!\\n\\nDanielle & Adam My parents stayed at Kate & Dann\\'s suite while they were in Seattle visiting my husband and me. They felt it was very comfortable and was a great location. Had everything they needed and lot\\'s of nice personal touches like coffee, tea, fruit, oatmeal, etc. When my parnets come back to visit they hope to stay here again! We had a fantastic stay at Kate and Danny\\'s suite.  From beginning to end Kate was quickly responsive, kind, and accommodating.  It\\'s the bottom floor of their house so you get the local feel while visiting - great neighborhood and close to so much.  Definitely take a walk to the Fat Hen for breakfast.  Really nice space, comfy bed, plenty of towels, some snacks, and a much appreciated Keurig machine! :)  Great outdoor space as well.  Parking was never a problem.  If there\\'s anything you need, Kate will work with you.  We felt like we were staying at a friend\\'s house. Highly recommended. My fiance and I had a great time when we stayed at Kate & Danny\\'s!  The downstairs suite was super clean and comfortable and they were both very welcoming.  The fridge was stocked with a few snacks and bottles of water which is always nice!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is a short walk to a few restaurants & bars, but the \"old\" Ballard neighborhood was about a mile away - a quick cab ride, or walk on a nice day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe arrived in Seattle really late, but the house was easy to find and easy to get access to.  Kate was also very communicative leading up to our stay, so there were no surprises.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'d stay there again anytime! Kate, Danny and Falcon were wonderful hosts! We were in town to celebrate my birthday, and their hospitality was so appreciated. The suite was very comfortable and spacious for the two of us. Their home is situated in a beautiful neighborhood with many activities within a short distance. I would definitely recommend staying with Kate and Danny, and will likely stay again when we\\'re in the area again. Loved the neighborhood the most! What a lovely part of Seattle. I enjoyed the little cafes around the area and Ballard. I also liked how clean it was. My mom is very picky when it comes to cleanliness and she thought it was very clean! There is plenty of room and closet space. I had 4 big suitcases and boxes to prepare for my wedding but it was still enough space. We had a little trouble with wifi but they fixed it immediately. They also check in with you to see if you need more snacks or anything. They do have a dog but he does not bark so I was not disturbed. The place is a little humid but Seattle is a humid place.  This private suite was just as advertised - extremely clean, bright & charming! A bonus on this hot weekend in Seattle: the suite was air conditioned too!! Kate & Danny were extremely responsive and informative - we had breakfast at one of their recommended spots (The Fat Hen) and it was lovely (and just a short walk from their house).  They also offered water, coffee, fruit, granola - it was very nice. I would highly recommend staying here for your next Seattle visit. The place was accurately described in the listing and well-suited for our needs. The breakfast nook and small refrigerator was a nice touch as it allowed us to have our morning coffee as we arranged the day. The neighborhood was nice, both quiet and quaint, with convenient access to downtown Seattle on the Rapid Ride and a scattering or restaurants within walking distance. The hosts were very friendly, providing us with information about their city and advice about what to see and how to get to certain locations. We really enjoyed our stay there and would recommend it to others. My wife and I loved staying with Kate and Danny! Their place is really cute and cozy and the room is identical to how it appears online. In addition to the bedroom and bathroom there is also a second room with a futon, fridge and microwave that we used for our meals as well as to lounge. We came to Seattle during a warmer time and we were glad to see a small fan in the closet that we could use. They also have air conditioning available, but it wasn\\'t warm enough for us to need to use it. The neighborhood they live is also really excellent, my wife and I walked and drove around it for hours; it\\'s great if you love exploring nature! Kate brought us fresh picked blueberries midway through our stay and we loved them! I highly recommend booking your next Seattle Airbnb with this couple! Wonderful place! Clean, quiet, spacious, and very comfortable! Would definitely stay again! Ok, first of all Seattle during clear summer days makes Kate and Danny\\'s job easy.  Their home is in a perfect neighborhood to access all of the cities abundant charms and still enjoy easy quiet time.  The suite is so comfortable you will not want to go home, and my wife who is picky (Martha Stewart is her hero...seriously) was super impressed.  The fresh picked berries were not a surprise due to earlier reviews but put a sweet sweet capstone on our trip.  But where my highest kudos comes in is that they did not \"HAVE\" to do everything they did from planning, suggestions, berries, Uber coupons, communication, and most importantly giving us the space to feel as if their home was our home, but they did.  And they did this in a way that was easy unforced and unobtrusive.   We cannot wait for our next trip to Seattle and when we do we hope this lovely, and yes \"Private\" second home is available. Our Stay at Kate and Danny\\'s place was the perfect start for our trip through the USA and Canada. We enjoyed our stay in the beautiful and comfortable suite and loved the quite area! If we\\'re happen to be in Seattle again one day, we\\'d definitely stay there again. Kate and Danny\\'s Private Suite couldn\\'t have been a more perfect place for my boyfriend and I to stay in Seattle. It\\'s impeccably clean, private, and quiet, plus it has one of the most comfortable beds I\\'ve ever slept in. Communication was super fast and friendly, and every detail (coffee! fresh fruit! extra blankets!) was thoughtfully taken care of. The neighborhood is also great-- with plenty of bar and restaurant options within walking distance. We\\'d definitely stay again, and recommend it to friends. Kate and Danny were excellent hosts.  They stayed in touch ahead of the booking date, and provided helpful information.  The suite was spacious and meticulously maintained.  It had air conditioning, too, which is just unheard of in Seattle - it was amazing on the hottest day of the year!  Everything was just like the pictures. Nice location, my daughter loved the park on the next block. Very comfortable. Quiet neighborhood, and the only sounds we heard were faint footsteps overhead occasionally. Nice to have fresh fruit, oatmeal, hot beverages in the morning. Recommended! Excellent! It was our first Airbnb experience and it couldn\\'t have been better. Clean, spacious room in a very nice neighborhood. Great restaurants nearby and walking distance to Ballard Locks. Kate and Danny were very welcoming and gave great advice for Seattle. Light breakfast provided was perfect after the long flight. I wish we had stayed longer! Gracious and cheerful hosts welcomed us into their suite, a \"home away from home.\"  Quiet neighborhhod nw of Seattle.  Exceeded our expectations, and this was our first airbnb experience.  They are welcome in our home any time.  Nancy and Bill Kate and Danny were awesome hosts! They were never more than a text message away with local recommendations and helpful information. The suite was perfect for us, very comfortable, and spotless. We totally fell in love with the neighborhood of Ballard. Not knowing much about Seattle before the trip, I\\'m so glad we just happened to end up staying in this beautiful, charming neighborhood. We wandered the area and enjoyed seeing the community gardens, gorgeous views of Seattle, and the lovely Golden Gardens Park, as well as all the great restaurants and bars. We also did a kayak tour with Ballard Kayak located in Golden Gardens Park--highly recommend. We\\'d stay here again in a heartbeat! Kate and Danny were very accommodating and the apartment was very nice and clean. Easily accessible to the D-line bus. Would highly recommend. Awesome, amazing, and fantastic. Very neat and clean with extra amenities. It seems like they thought of everything! Great area in Ballard and only a 20 minute bus to downtown. Highly recommended!  The stay was so easy. Sleeping soundly was a joy on the comfortable bed and quiet location. And there was always the perfect parking place available right in front.  Kate and Danny were great hosts! Their guest suite is a cozy home away from home getaway. Their location in Ballard was convenient for all our planned activities. I definitely recommend staying with them! Kay and Danny were great hosts. They made our stay in Seattle WA a pleasure. We enjoyed staying at their cozy suite.  Kate and Danny are great hosts with a beautiful apartment.  The location in Ballard is close (3 blocks) from one of the best pizza parlors in Seattle, and a terrific bakery, bar and breakfast/lunch restaurant.  The bus to downtown Seattle is also 3 blocks away, and a 30-35 minute ride.  Uber and Lyft services are readily available too.  I had a car for part of my 7-day visit (easy street parking), and really only needed it to visit Boeing\\'s manufacturing facility in Everett - a highly recommended tour!  The Ballard Sunday farmers market has the best looking vegetables you will ever see, and the area along Ballard Ave, more fine restaurants.  All in all a terrific base to explore the Seattle area. We had an excellent stay! Kate and Danny were gracious hosts and made us feel very welcome. This was our first airbnb experience and we were fortunate enough to have Kate and Danny as are hosts. The rooms very very clean and comfortable, and the other amenities were just perfect for our stay. The location was ideal for us as well, with great coffee and food within a short walking distance. Thank you for the great conversation, as well, Kate! We may very well be back! We had a great stay at this spot! Exactly as promised, extremely clean, lots of useful amenities (iron and ironing board, coffee, nice hangers in the closet, etc) and it was very easy to communicate with the hosts. They were very accommodating regarding our late arrival and early departure. Located in a beautiful, safe, and very walkable neighborhood in Seattle. Highly recommend! Our experience was great.  The information we had when we came in (where the suite was, restaurant recommendations, house rules, etc.) was very clear and well displayed.  The suite was just as described.  I was traveling with my brother, so they had the 2nd room with a futon set up for us on our arrival.  When we told people where we were staying we got a lot of comments like \"I don\\'t want to have to stay somewhere where I have to have a conversation with someone\", \"I don\\'t want to have other people around an bugging me all the time\".  Let me just say that this is NOT how Kate and Danny operate.  They touched base a couple times throughout the stay to make sure everything was okay, but they weren\\'t dropping in all the time \"bugging\" us.  They also made it clear that they were around for any questions/recommendations.  We had our week packed full of stuff and were really only at the house to sleep, so we had to \"set up\" a time on the last day of our stay just to \"meet\" the people who provided this amazing house.  When you stay in a hotel you risk getting a room near an elevator, or with loud people above you.  You won\\'t have this problem here.  Don\\'t get me wrong, from time to time you will hear them walking above you, but couldn\\'t hear anything else.  It was very quiet and peaceful.  Kate and Danny thought of everything to make the stay great.  They provided basic toiletries and a blow dryer, they had a mini fridge and microwave, city guides in the rooms, water, granola bars, fruit, tea, coffee.  It was all very well thought out.  The 2 rooms and bathroom were very spacious and clean and just as advertised.  Parking was always available on the street right in front of the house.  I would absolutely recommend staying here.  It was nice and close to downtown Seattle (15-20 min drive max for us even in traffic), easy access to I-5, a lot of cute restaurants in the area.  Thanks so much for opening your beautiful home to us Kate and Danny! Thank you so much for hosting my friend and I. I loved your house and the neighbourhood so much. Everything was super clean and thank you for all the resources for traveling around. I will sure be back to stay at your place again. It was a great first airbnb experience.  I really recommend staying there. Our stay at Kate and Danny\\'s was great!  The space is very clean and comfortable.  I only met Danny, and he was very friendly.  We will definitely try to book their place again if we need to be in Ballard.  Highly recommended! I had a 100% positive experience. The accommodations were just as they were described. Everything was super clean. Access to the house and all correspondence was easy and effortless. Kate and Danny are charming. I\\'ll be back. Kate & Danny\\'s place was super cozy, clean, and spacious. They provided water bottles and granola bars for us too! One thing to be aware of is that you enter through the front door of their house and they live upstairs. But this was never really an issue for us as we had complete privacy.  staying with Kate and Danny was amazing! their little downstairs place was so clean and fresh. the bed was so comfy and warm. I loved that they provided us with slippers to wear and lots of coffee and tea and granola bars. I also enjoyed the yard we had access to. Kate was so easy to get in touch with before we arrived and during our stay. I only wish we had run into her and Danny and falcon earlier in our stay because they were so friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend staying here. it feels homey but still clean and professional enough that I could still feel like I was away on vacation. Just like the description/picture - super clean, welcoming downstairs suite in a house in a quiet residential neighborhood.  Nice amenities with the coffee machine & fixings, granola bars, bottled water.  Hosts were there if we needed them, but otherwise unobtrusive.  Keyless entry was great, especially since we were coming back quite late at night. Kate and Danny\\'s place is exactly what they advertised: a private suite in charming Ballard! Everything was very clean and our hosts were very accommodating to help us with little things. There are excellent places to eat in the neighbourhood as well as a bus into downtown and a car rental within minutes. Great place at a fair price! What you see in this photo is what you get, PLUS lots more! Kate & Danny\\'s place is wonderful; great neighborhood too. We felt secure, it was quiet and they keep this place immaculately clean. There\\'s more to the place than this photo, another whole room with Kuerig machine and snacks and they left things in the frig to make it all complete. We slept like babies and had plenty of space to give each other room. We were visiting relatives who lived nearby and we stayed for 4 nights. We will go back again and again because of the convenience and how comfortable we were. We were way more comfortable here than in the many hotels we have stayed in. We highly recommend Kate & Danny\\'s place. Kate and Danny were very considerate hosts and our stay in Ballard turned out to be a very pleasant one, despite some unseasonably cold weather. The modern downstairs space with efficient heating certainly helped combat the wintry conditions. We liked the location which was close to the main “Rapid D” bus line from downtown Seattle and we also made use of the little food extras, and coffee maker provided in the living room. A number of restaurants and cafes were also within easy walking distance of the house and our hosts provided written information on these businesses. \\r\\nI should also add that the accomodation was spotlessly clean and Kate was very responsive in making sure that we did not run low on the coffee - two enthusiastic coffee drinkers here.    The accommodations were great, matching the description on the website.  The location was perfect for us--close to our daughter\\'s place in Ballard and close to downtown.  The street was quiet and parking was readily available.  Love the access code entry system.  It is much easier than a key.  Only suggestion would be to provide a chair in the entry way to sit on while taking shoes off and putting them on. Wonderful private perfect clean\\nAnd that\\'s just beginning  Perfect Airbnb stay!  Kate and Danny are warm and welcoming, as is the space.  The bed and bedding are high-quality and comfortable, the sitting room / extra bedroom is outfitted with a mini-fridge, keurig coffee maker (complete with both tea and coffee cartridges), fruit, food bars, basic dishes and utensils, and nice big filtered water pitcher.  They are located in a clean quiet neighborhood with plenty of parking (we had 2 cars and easily found spaces for both).  The keyless entry made it so that they simply gave us the code and we lived there for four days without even meeting them until we finally made a point of saying hello in person upon check-out. They are a super friendly young couple with a terrific and mellow dog, Falcon, who have clearly put a lot of thought and effort into creating a comfortable space. Thank you, Kate & Danny! Kate and Danny were extremely welcoming and had so many great recommendations for places to eat in the area and where to go. While we never actually met (there\\'s a private entrance) I knew Kate was only a text or phone call away. There was a little coffee maker, mini fridge, and microwave and she even set out some oatmeal and granola bars for us for breakfast! I stayed here with my boyfriend and we were \"those guests\" who accidentally spilled red wine and it got on the white sheets! Needless to say I was mortified. Kate was super chill about it and I left some money for her to be able to replace them since there was no way it was going to come out. Overall it was a great cozy getaway to Seattle and I would highly recommend staying here :)  We had a great time visiting Seattle. Our accommodations were perfect. It was great to have the 2 separate rooms so one of us could sleep late and the other could read, drink coffee, listen to music, etc. Extras like coffee, cream, some breakfast items were much appreciated. Our bed was very comfortable as well.\\nWe loved being close to some restaurants that were within walking distance. The neighborhood was quiet and fun to explore and walk in.\\nWe will definetly return to this cute and cozy and comfortable airbnb. Great space in a cute neighbourhood. Rooms were bright and clean and the bed was very comfortable! We would definitely stay here again. The reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Had a great stay in this cozy suite! Getting in and out was easy, and we had no problems finding the place. We didn\\'t end up needing to get in touch with Kate or Danny, but felt confident that we could have if needed! Unfortunately, we did not get to meet Kate & Danny, but we had a lovely stay at they place.  The suite is very private, clean and quiet.  The neighborhood seems very pleasant.  Kate was very responsive to all of our texts.  Thanks for a great place to stay! Kate and Danny were excellent hosts!  Every detail of the home was thoughtfully arranged to make it feel welcoming and comfortable.  The rooms were clean and beautiful.  My daughter slept on a futon in the second bedroom, and she was very excited to have the kitchenette in her room!  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is convenient and pleasant.  Restaurants, an ice cream shop, and a little market are all within a mile or less, and the neighborhood is lush with flowers and gardens.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur hosts were professional and easy to reach whenever I texted or emailed.  I highly recommend this suite for a getaway in Seattle! Our stay in Kate and Danny\\'s suite was very enjoyable. The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable and the bedroom has wonderful natural light. We also liked that they kept a fan in the closet which we always like to use at night for a little white noise.  The bathroom also had a lot of natural lights and the shower stream was nice and strong.  We appreciated having the second room to store all our stuff, and it was very helpful having the mini fridge and a Kuerig for some late night hot tea and snacks.  We did hear a little bit of noise from above, but it wasn\\'t anything that kept us awake at night.  The neighborhood is fantastic.  Parking was a breeze, and we were easily able to walk to several delicious neighborhood restaurants (at Kate\\'s recommendation).  Communication with Kate was always quick and friendly.  Overall, it was a great stay.   We stayed 4 days at Kate and Dannys beautiful appartment and couldn\\'t have found a better one for our very first Air\\'bnb. Kate and Danny provided us with everythink what could be needed plus cereals, coffee, tea and a variety of caring products. \\nThe bed was very comfortable (we also found some sweets and lot\\'s of information material beside it :) ) and the sleeping room has a direct connection to a pretty garden space.\\nBus connection to downtown Seattle is just four blocks away, but also Ballard (market street) is worth visiting). Highly recommendable! The place was comfortable and clean and had everything we needed for our short stay. The area is nice and relaxed with access to downtown on the bus. \\n\\nMet Kate briefly and she seems very nice. \\n\\nWould recommend this place for a few nights. Kate and Danny were terrific hosts and the suite was lovely.  It was spacious, clean and inviting, and Kate and Danny left us granola bars, fruit, and oatmeal, along with coffee and tea.  There was even gourmet chocolates on the bedside table!  It was so relaxing to come back to this space after exploring Seattle.  Would highly recommend! Thank you Kate and Danny! My wife and I had a wonderful time staying in Kate and Danny\\'s suite over a long weekend in early June. They were very gracious hosts, happy to chat with us about the city and their favorite spots, but also respecting our privacy. The suite was immaculate and they included some thoughtful touches like chocolates in the bedroom! The neighborhood is ideal for those who, like us, don\\'t want to be right downtown. It is quiet and residential feeling, but there are a couple of fun restaurant/bakery/bar strips within easy walking distance. There are also two bus lines that will easily get you to downtown and to Fremont.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is still plenty of Seattle left for us to explore, so we hope to be back! We stayed at Kate and Danny\\'s for a couple nights on our trip and it was our first Airbnb experience. The ad was everything that we thought it would be and more. A very professional level of cleanliness and a very nice level of privacy considering you\\'re in the same house. The location is a short drive away from everything we wanted to see and the neighborhood seemed pleasant as well. Kate was quick to respond to my questions and was helpful. Would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting this area and in this price point I think you can\\'t beat it!  Our hosts were very communicative and accommodating. The suite was charming and very clean. We were very happy with this reservation and would highly recommend to anyone!  This recent trip to Ballard was lovely and Kate and Danny were great as hosts! Kate was very helpful with navigating the neighborhood and provided some great recommendations. The accommodation so comfortable and convenient for our stay. The suite had everything you could need in a visit, with a few extras! It was cozy, clean and quiet, and in a great location (close to nearby bakeries and access to the bus). We enjoyed our stay, and I would definitely return! Highly recommend! Everything was exactly as described.  I really enjoyed my 2 night stay.  Chocolates, fresh fruit, coffee, tea, and drinks were provided.  The neighborhood is quiet and there is plenty of parking.  Downtown Ballard is about 1.5 miles away and is easy to walk to (or about a $7 cab ride).  Easy access to public transportation as well.  I didn\\'t spend a lot of time in the suite, but it was very comfortable.  I would definitely stay here again. The place was lovely and cozy.  We would definitely stay again.  Kate and Danny were very accommodating and very friendly.  Everything that was listed was included and more.   Kate was very welcoming and easy to communicate with. She checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Her place was very very clean and just as described. It was perfect for our short stay in Seattle. There was also plenty of parking on the street. Thank you, Kate for a great stay! We spent two restful nights in this clean, comfortable, cozy suite in Ballard. Kate and Danny provided clear instructions that made check-in seamless, and generously gave suggestions for places to eat, best places to view fireworks, etc. This quiet residential neighbourhood includes some interesting little eateries just a few blocks walk away. We had a very positive experience, and would definitely stay here again. Kate and Danny were wonderful hosts. They sent us a helpful guide book with local restaurants and events before we arrived. Efficient in all planning and details. Plus the place was comfortable and soothing decor, everything very convenient that you might need. Exactly as described in their posting. They were friendly and welcoming, but respected our privacy too. A lovely neighborhood, pleasant, friendly; people say hello to you as you walk around. FREE PARKING--amazing in Seattle. Short drive / bus ride to downtown Seattle. Would definitely stay there again. This was our first experience with airbnb and Kate and Danny made our trip very enjoyable and we highly recommend it to others.  They were organized, accommodating and friendly and we appreciated the easy access with the keyless door entry, safe and clean environment and resourceful welcome letter. Great location and wonderful apartment.  Will be sure to book here again next we are in Seattle.  Thanks Kate & Danny Kate and Danny\\'s place was so incredibly easy and comfortable. Everything is extremely clean and well kept and the location makes it very convenient to get to all parts of Ballard, Fremont and Phinney. We could not have asked for a smoother experience! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated.  We especially appreciated the quiet setting.  The free street parking was readily available.  The fresh fruit, snack bars and filtered water  made us feel welcomed.  I would definitely stay again. The rooms were clean and comfortable.  We were out sightseeing so only used the suite for sleeping .  We received email confirmation prior to our arrival in Seattle and instructions.  Since the living space was separate and our stay was short we didn\\'t require anything else from our hosts. Great place to stay in Ballard. Apartment is exactly as described, along with special touches such as coffee, granola bars, and water bottles. Quiet, clean, and spacious with two very accommodating hosts. Would definitely recommend to others.  We had a wonderful time staying at Kate and Danny\\'s. The suite is just perfect, with every little detail covered. There was everything we needed for a good breakfast, chocolates by our bedside and all bathroom toiletries taken care of. Also lots of reading material on Seattle, which was a great help. The suite is spotlessly clean, I mean it shines! It was nice to be able to use the back terrace to drink an aperitif after a long day exploring Seattle. If I was returning to Seattle this is the only place I would stay, you will get better service than in any hotel. Thank you so much Kate and Danny. Place looks exactly like the pictures. Host is very easy to get a hold of and communicate with. The area is not to far away from downtown and has some great areas for food and drink. Would recommend renting a car if you\\'re going to stay here. The property was lovely and very comfortable. I thought it was really thoughtful that fruit, toiletries, and visitor\\'s guides were available in the property. We really loved the location, and the neighborhood was great for walking to local shops and restaurants.\\n\\nI would definitely stay again and would recommend to others visiting the area. Great accommodation. Pretty location in a quiet neighborhood. Extremely clean. Loved the coffee, tea, fruit and snacks! Wonderful stay at Kate and Danny\\'s. Everything was clean and just as described. Kate was so very accommodating and a pleasure to work with. Hope to stay there again when visiting our college kids:)  We absolutely loved our stay at Kate and Danny\\'s beautiful home in Seattle.  The home is located in a charming, quiet section of town but is either walking distance or a very short drive or bike ride to lots of great neighborhoods, including the main Ballard area, Fremont, Green Lake, and others.  The accommodations are spotlessly clean, very comfortable, spacious, and well-appointed.  Kate went very far out of her way to make us feel welcome in the city and at her home.  We really can\\'t say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay here - by far our best Airbnb experience, and very highly recommended. Kate and Danny have been great hosts! The place looks just lovely. They put a lot of thought into it and every single detail. The appartement was very comfy. Although there is no possibility to cook, you don\\'t need to be hungry - just follow the recommendations Kate and Danny will give you where to find good food. We tried some and they all turned out delicious! :-)\\nWe met both and they are just so nice and friendly and took good care of us and made sure we have everything we needed. I really would stay at their place again! Had a wonderful stay at Kate and Danny\\'s.  Apartment was spotless and very comfortable.  Kitchen had great coffee and breakfast food.  Will definitely stay here again! This Airbnb was even better than described!! The hosts provided very clear information in advance and great suggestions for enjoying our time in Ballard We are repeat visitors at Kate & Danny\\'s apartment.  This apartment is a great home base to explore Ballard, Seattle, and surrounding area.  The listing accurately describes the apartment (including the ease of parking on the street in their area).  The keypad entry is a very convenient--you do not need to worry about a house key.  The list of places to eat and drink is very handy.  \\r\\n Kate an Danny\\'s place was great! Clean, and quiet, and just what I needed in a great location. I\\'d definitely stay here again.  Staying at this airbnb accommodation has been one of my best experiences so far. The place is as described on the site, perhaps better than that. With tons of natural light and view of Mt. Rainier from the bedroom, it certainly is a premium accommodation. I stayed here for one week and worked from home. And its just been terrific. \\r\\n\\r\\nMuna is a fabulous host. She made me feel welcomed to the place. She made sure that I was comfortable with everything, and gave me my privacy, whenever I wanted it. She was very courteous, caring and communicative throughout my stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I had a great stay and I will certainly consider staying here again, whenever chance permits me next. We enjoyed our time @ Muna\\'s pad.  She is a gracious hostess & a warm individual.  The accomadations were lovely, just like the pic!  Muna\\'s place is located in the heart of Ballard and only a few blocks away from our son, so it was perfect for us!  The coffee was wonderful & the elevator made the 3rd floor a breeze to get to with our overpacked bags!  Enjoy your time with her, she is a delight! Debbie is a great host! She and her son greeted me and showed me to the separate room behind the house. Their place was easy to find and in a nice, quiet neighborhood. This detached room rental was a great option for me as I knew I would be returning late and did not want to disturb anyone. I could easily go around back at the end of the night with the handy flash light key chain that held the room key. \\r\\n\\r\\nI could tell right away that Debbie put a lot of thought into the room making sure that her guests had everything they could possibly need. The bed and pillows were very comfortable providing the good night\\'s sleep I needed for the next day. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, I was able to park right in front of the house on the street which is always a plus in Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI appreciate the time and thought Debbie put into this rental to make it a comfortable respite from your busy day in the city. I will certainly check with Debbie first the next time I need accommodations in Seattle. Debbie has gone the extra long miles to make us feel comfortable and at ease. This was my first experience with air B and B and I must say, I did not expect such exceptional professionalism and personal care. With hosts like this, there is no point looking at hotels. \\nI will be back here again and encourage anyone to try this brilliant spot!!! \\nA+++  My daughter and I loved your detached room.  We felt like that we stayed at star 5 hotel. Debbie (host) is so friendly with my girl.  She described in Airbnb is EXACT.  She is very honesty. The stay here was absolutely perfect and far exceeded expectations. Debbie was very friendly and helpful suggesting local places to visit. The area was quiet and safe, while easy to get to downtown by car.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was exceptionally clean and well stocked with towels, soaps, and snacks. The fresh ground coffee for the French press was especially a nice touch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould highly recommend for staying in the Seattle area. Debbie has converted a backyard flat into a great little Airbnb space that has all the amenities you would expect to find in a hotel room. The flat has nice, new fittings, space to unpack and my partner and I also appreciated the privacy that the flat offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nDebbie was a great host -- very warm and welcoming, and interested in making our stay as comfortable as possible. She also makes amazing muffins! The location was perfect for us -- a nice quiet neighborhood near the family member we were in town to visit.\\r\\nDebbie, our hostess, was a delight. She was friendly, helpful and well organized. We were provided with great instructions for locating the place and it was exactly as described, a private bedroom and bath cottage in the rear of Debbie\\'s home. The room was cosy, spotlessly clean and comfortable.\\r\\nWe hope to find Debbie\\'s accommodations available when we make a return visit to Ballard. My husband and I stayed in Debbie\\'s detached guest suite for our anniversary weekend. The room is fantastic. It\\'s even better than it looks from the pictures, and it\\'s immaculately clean. There were several sweet, homey touches (homemade muffins, mints on the nightstand, shower supplies included, etc.). The weekend was hot, but the room stayed cool. The location is perfect - close to everything delightful in Ballard, including fabulous food (Eat at Delancey and Essex). I will stay in this guest suite next time I\\'m in Seattle, for sure. It is Suitable room that comfortably fit 2 people. Everything are super clean as \"Five Star Hotels\" The bed was comfortable. Debbie was very kind and friendly. The neighborhood is quiet and lots of restaurants, cafe where are really good, within walking distance. Overall I had a comfortable stay and I would stay here again. Debbie\\'s space is amazing. It is inviting, comfortable, stylish, and perfectly located. We were just a few minutes from UW, a short walk from downtown Ballard (my favorite neighborhood in Seattle!), and a short drive from Downtown/City Center. \\nDebbie provided everything and more we could have needed to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Homemade muffins, everything we needed for coffee & tea in the morning, toiletries, and an incredibly comfortable bed. \\nThe room was beautiful as well... Plenty of natural light, roomy bathroom, and closet! I loves that the room was separate from the house which gave us as much privacy as we wanted, but still allowed us to interact with our host - who is so sweet and welcoming! \\nI hope to stay here again and highly HIGHLY recommend it!  I thoroughly enjoyed my weekend stay at Debbie\\'s private guest studio. The room was beautiful, immaculately clean, very private (with its own entrance) and located in a lovely and quiet neighbourhood. The bed was comfy and everything needed was provided. Debbie was a very attentive host and even gave me a car ride to my workshop on Sunday morning. Highly recommended! \\r\\n Debbie was a truly wonderful host! I needed a last minute place to sleep before starting my long road trip back to Florida and I found her place and contacted her, and even though I contacted her in the late evening, she got back to me super fast and was able to accommodate me. She was extremely friendly and very helpful with directions and whatnot. When I arrived she showed me the place behind hee house - it was super clean & welcoming and she had a little binder with information & the internet code, dishware/utensils, a little fridge and everything one could possibly need for a comfortable, short stay. The place is quiet and cozy. She was so sweet, even made blueberry muffins to take with me for my trip - and they were yum! :)\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinitely recommend this place to anyone! 5 stars for sure. This place was a great comfort.  I really enjoyed staying here and felt like I was in a detached hotel.  Thank you so much! Debbie\\'s place was fantastic! It was a perfect size, spotlessly clean, comfortable and in a great location in Seattle. The bed was so comfortable, the bathroom was perfect, and the extras (flat screen tv with cable, coffee, tea, snacks) made the stay even better. I only wish I had more time in Seattle to stay in the room. I will definitely stay here again. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t get to meet Debbie, but she made me feel very welcome and provided everything I needed for my time in Seattle.  This was my first time doing Airbnb and it was a great experience. Debbie\\'s house is gorgeous and the guest house is perfect! The location is also great. Debbie was very thoughtful, took care of every single detail- I was very impressed! Thanks for everything Debbie!! I am moving to Seattle next week and I will definitely recommend her place to all visitors. Cozy space w great light and privacy! Debbie\\'s place was perfect for our need. She was also so welcoming and we wouldn\\'t hesitate to rebook if available! Debbie is the best hostess and her place was so nice! What a comfortable stay. Her hospitality made for a nice trip. Thank you for the coffee, baked goods, and conversation.  Debbie is a fantastic host, friendly, quick to respond and makes delicious blueberry muffins! In Seattle for a weekend away and the location could not be better. Quiet, clean and a beautiful setting. We will definitely re book next time I\\'m the city. Thank you! Debbie was super helpful and gracious, I needed to print out my boarding pass and luggage receipts and she did everything to make that happen. I had to leave fairly early and Debbie was so sweet about wanting to make sure that I had something for breakfast. The Neighborhood was very quaint, house is located just across from a school which was very quiet from the private room in the backyard. Wish I had more time in Seattle, I\\'ll be back with my husband next time. :) Thank you Debbie your private room is just perfect, super clean and inviting.  Debbie\\'s guest room was awesome. She is friendly and greeted us with a warm smile often. The bed was very comfortable. The coffee was delicious. The bathroom was clean. The neighborhood was adorable and there was plenty of parking in front of the house. She made muffins for us the first morning and left a few snacks in the fridge. With the guest room being detached, we had plenty of privacy and slept wonderfully. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Debbie! debbie was the perfect host with the perfect set-up for an overnighter.\\r\\n\\r\\nvery clean, with plenty of room.  we will be back. Debbie\\'s guestroom was the perfect place to stay on my trip to Seattle. The detached studio had everything I needed -- from shampoo to coffee and half n\\' half for the morning -- and even chocolates on the bedside table with a hand-written note. Debbie was a fabulous host with excellent communication and super-organized directions. These little details make all the difference. I highly recommend staying at her studio in Ballard.  Debbie was an amazing and thoughtful host! You can tell she is an experienced AirBnB host through the communication before and during your stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nHer description of the place was as promised and we were extremely satisfied with our stay at Debbie\\'s. It was relatively easy to navigate into downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods. Don\\'t forget to try Paseo :]\\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely recommend Debbie to others and would rebook in the future! I was very blessed to find such an oasis. So much personal touch meant all the world. From homemade sweets to individualized messages and clarifies, I could not have asked for a more comfortable and enjoyable experience. I hope to cross paths with Debbie again, and I think this kind of legendary hosting should be the standard.  Staying at Debbie\\'s was a fantastic experience! She was very helpful in the planning of our trip (our first to Seattle) and checking in on us occasionally to see if we needed anything. The room was as pictured, super clean and inviting. The fridge was stocked with a few snacks, and she provided scones for us the morning after we arrived (plus fresh half-n-half and warm muffins a few days into our trip!).  Personalized notes, baked goods and a genuineness about her showed that she truly enjoyed hosting us. She has set the bar high for other Airbnb hosts!\\r\\n\\r\\nHer immediate neighborhood was very quiet and pleasant. We used the buses and rented a car from the rental place a few blocks down the street. No problems with either!\\r\\n\\r\\nI would highly recommend staying with Debbie. If/when I return to Seattle, I plan to stay with her again! Clean, comfortable, warm with amenities like homemade scones on doorstep in the morning. Bathroom is spotless with a tub for soaking away travel soreness. We felt very welcomed. The room is small, so great for 1 person or 2 who get along well. I recommend. Debbie was amazing! Her guest room was the perfect space, we honestly didn\\'t want to leave. Debbie\\'s attention to detail is honestly unmatched in our experience. She gave us great recommendations on where to eat and hang out. We hope we get the chance to go to Seattle again, and if we do we\\'ll try our hardest to stay with her. She even had some baked goods for us in the morning! Do yourself a favor and stay here, it might be your best airbnb experience, it was ours.  The cottage was clean, comfortable, and had everything you need including shampoo and conditioner. It felt as if the floors were heated and it was amazing. Debbie was promptly communicative, welcoming, and accommodating.  Her space is lovely, well-built, cozy, comfortable, private, and spotless.  Her personal touches, like in-room french-press coffee and muffins in the fridge, were much-appreciated!  The neighborhood is quiet with easy access to restaurants and waterfront fun.  We loved it.  Highly recommended!     Debbie was a fabulous host from the very first interaction.  Her warmth was evident even by email!  She made check-in a breeze, and her guest book made getting settled into the space and connected to the WiFi really easy.  She respected my privacy, but was always a text away if I needed anything.  The brief chats that we had were nice.  She\\'s obviously a caring person who is interested in meeting new people and having new experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe space was exactly as shown and described, and very comfortable.  Debbie has obviously put a lot of thought into making her guests comfortable.  Everything was clean and tidy, the hair dryer had umpf, the water pressure was good, etc.  The bamboo linens were so soft I\\'m considering buying some for home.  She brought generous (double) portions of fresh baked breakfast items (scones, muffins, quick bread) every other day, with generous pats of butter.  The coffee from Stump Town was delicious (half and half in the fridge).  The system for having her clean the dishes in the main house worked smoothly.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI was in town to visit family, and couldn\\'t stay with them due to my cat allergy.  This was the perfect set up!  I was close to my family, and had a comfy cozy retreat to return to after being out and about all day.  I would definitely stay with Debbie again, and my family is looking forward to recommending her space to other visitors. We had a fantastic stay here! The room was clean and inviting and stocked with snacks, coffee, and baked goods. In a cute area of Ballard. Our interaction with Debbie was brief since we were not at the room much, but she was extremely friendly and welcoming. We would definitely stay here again!  Debbie\\'s location in Ballard was fantastic!  Clean, high-quality, and cozy. The radiant heating floors are a nice touch in the cold months. A great spot that I\\'d try to stay at again if I\\'m back in Seattle.  We felt completely at home at Debbie\\'s space. It was warm, clean, comfortable and perfect for what we needed. I had just had hip replacement surgery and wasn\\'t able to go up the stairs in my own home. We checked in the day I was released from the hospital. I instantly fell asleep in the cozy bed and I am certain it was helpful on my road to recovery. The delicious scones made us feel pampered. Thank you. We will recommend your spot for family members who are visiting. It will be perfect for my dad when he comes to town.  Debbie\\'s detached room was amazing! She was a great host, super thoughtful, and a plus that she made really good baked goods in advance that lasted us for every morning. Her communication was always timely and professional. I loved how thoughtful she was around hospitality. There was a binder filled with information that really helped my Husband and I navigate our way through suggested restaurants, coffee, and other hangout spots in Ballard. Her place is super clean and she stocks snacks such as: delicious coffee, french press, directions on how to use french press, an electric kettle, dishes, mugs, utensils, half in half in her mini fridge, orange juice, cliff bars, mandarin cuties, tea, an umbrella, books, beach towels, extra towels… All these personal touches made the stay that much more welcoming. The space was just right for two people. This was my first experience in an Airbnb and she\\'s set the bar pretty high. My Husband and I plan on coming back to Seattle on a yearly basis and we would definitely stay here again! Thanks for being a blessing to our trip in Seattle. Debbie was very thorough in communicating about directions, contact information and everything we needed. She was a wonderful host. We couldn\\'t have asked for anyone nicer/accomodating.\\r\\nFor some reason, the directions stated put us off course a bit, but we did find our way easy enough. Thanks for the delicious scones!! Also your kindness in sending back my iPhone charger..sorry about that! Debbie was an amazing host! She was extremely approachable, welcoming, and friendly. Her warm muffins in the morning were delicious! The room was very clean, private, and comfortable. It had all the amenities that you would need and more. The small details such as the handwritten note and snacks were appreciated. I would highly recommend staying at Debbie\\'s place! The room was very nice and as advertised. Very quiet neighborhood. Easy access and no hassles at all. Close to downtown. Debbie greeted me and texted almost daily to see if everything was OK. Baked goods (Muffins) on arrival and cookies mid-week were a treat. We absolutely loved staying at Debbie\\'s Airbnb in Ballard. The unit was perfect for our needs. It\\'s new, modern, very clean and cute. Not to mention, she provided the makings for fresh french press coffee, which went well with the incredible baked items that she left on our front doorstep two of the mornings we were there. Debbie was really great, friendly, helpful. She provided suggestions for places to eat and things to see. Ballard is a great Seattle neighborhood and her place was the perfect location to visit our relatives in Ballard and also take in other nearby neighborhoods, such as Fremont as well as downtown Seattle. We just can\\'t say enough how much we enjoyed our experience. We\\'ll stay there again if it\\'s available the next time we\\'re in town. This place was great!  DELICIOUS baked goods in the mornings, awesome coffee, a super comfy bed and everything else we could have wanted.  Thanks Debbie! It was a perfect stay at Debbie\\'s guest suite. It is located in a beautiful neighbourhood, and close to a lovely area to shop/dine/explore. Debbie was so accommodating, with many tips on how to enjoy our suite, as well as information on what to see during our stay in Ballard/Seattle. The suite itself is beautiful- very comfortable bed, great amenities, and a very functional space. The in-floor heating and the freshly baked morning scones were a treat. We look forward to staying here again! We absolutely LOVED our stay at Debbie\\'s. The room itself is just gorgeous! It is immaculate, cozy and very welcoming - you feel right at home immediately. \\n\\nWe could not recommend staying at Debbie\\'s more highly. She is such a lovely host who takes great care of her guests. The coffee, hot chocolate plus home baked goods, are the little extras that make you feel at home. \\n\\nThe neighbourhood is fantastic. So quiet yet only a short walk away there is so much to discover including amazing restaurants/cafés, coffee (which we loved!) local breweries, boutiques and so much more. \\n\\nDebbie provided so many great hints on what to see in Seattle and the local neighbourhood of Ballard. We wish we could have stayed longer. It\\'s hosts like Debbie that make the air bnb experience that much more enjoyable. We will be back!  Debbie was such a kind and generous host. I can\\'t imagine having a better BNB experience in Seattle.\\n\\nHer home in Ballard is situated in a very nice, quiet neighborhood right across a small school - which made the area feel a lot safer. Her home is complete with everything you will need for a short stay: clean bedding, sets of towels, toiletries, mini fridge, kettle, coffee press, plates and bowls, utensils and more. We had privacy, felt extremely comfortable and right at home. The place was impeccably clean and tidy too!\\n\\nDebbie baked the most delicious homemade scones I have ever had in my life, and her blueberry muffins are divine. We love Debbie and would definitely stay at her home again when we go back to Seattle. *Disclaimer* - we didn\\'t stay here, we rented the room for my sister who was in town visiting. However, we spent time in the room and met Debbie as well. The room was spotless, the bed very comfortable, the scones and other treats delicious and the radiant heat floors a nice touch. Debbie was kind and super easy to communicate with and even took extra care to make sure her dogs weren\\'t around the yard when my sister was at the room (she\\'s allergic). The neighborhood is adorable, safe, and close to some fantastic restaurants. We\\'ll definitely be renting the room again for future visiting guests! There is so much goodness to Debbie.  In her cottage she has created an experience that you just don\\'t get in a hotel: warm blueberry muffins delivered to your door, a floor that is warm to the foot makes the space even more cozy, a fridge with apples, juice, granola bars, and fresh cream, plus a bookcase of interesting books and magazines, a bathroom full of provisions, hand cream by the bedside, an umbrella and a flashlight. Debbie directed us to places of interest in Seattle and was such a kind person. Our stay at her place really  added to our Seattle experience.  We really liked staying in this room. It is just as described, and we really enjoyed the privacy and little added touches, like fresh tea and coffee with cream and scones in the refrigerator. Debbie welcomed us after we had arrived, and was very nice. The room is clean, the bed is comfy, and it is just the right amount of space for two people. The neighborhood is so beautiful, I wish we could have spent more time in Ballard! Really nice clean space with everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Debbie was an excellent host. I am not sure if my trip was for business or a vacation !  Debbie\\'s detached room in Ballard is more like your own private bungalow !!  It was spotless, well appointed and really comfortable.  The bed was fantastic, the towels were luxurious and the French press let me make my coffee just the way I like it.  The neighborhood was just as advertised...quiet, safe and plenty of parking.  Debbie\\'s suggestions for local restaurants were outstanding.  Can\\'t wait to visit again. Debbie was the perfect hostess.  Her scones are awesome and the space was just perfect for us.  We were nearby our children/grandchildren and we were in a great neighborhood.  Debbie\\'s recommendations about places for coffee, food, etc, were spot on and we really enjoyed walking to several places.  We will definitely recommend Debbie\\'s air b&b to others traveling up this way and we hope to stay here again too. We had a most pleasant stay at Debbie\\'s guest suite located in a nice family neighborhood at the Ballard area. We particularly appreciated Debbie\\'s warm welcome and her sunny personality. The room which is separate from the main house is very private and well appointed with many quality and thoughtful touches. It is rare to find a \"real\" hair dryer that will actually dry and style your hair in a hotel room but you will find one here :) along with big fluffy towels, shampoo/conditioner/liquid shower soap. The mini fridge was well stocked with apples, granola bars, juices and even cream for a relaxing cup of tea or coffee with a French press all provided. My husband and I both had a restful sleep on a very comfortable bed and woke up to some delicious home made scones. Thank you Debbie for making our first airbnb experience such a positive one.  Our stay with Debbie was wonderful! We felt right at home, almost as if we were staying with a relative. We arrived late on our first night and Debbie drove us down to 65th Ave so we could get some dinner and even offered to pick us up when we were done. When we got back she had left us cookies as well as muffins in the morning. Her place was so nice and clean we really enjoyed the Guest House. It is also in a great location since we wanted to see many breweries and visit Chuck\\'s Hop Shop. We were able to walk to Ballard and Fremont easily, both places have great restaurants. I would definitely recommend staying at Debbie\\'s place when you visit Seattle, it was also super easy to get to from downtown.  Debbie recommended The Dray to us which is a small tap house with excellent flat breads, we enjoyed it so much that we went back both nights while we were there.  Debbie was a sweetheart! I got lot trying to find the place and she was kind enough to help me locate the place over the phone. The cottage is tucked away in the backyard and the neighborhood is absolutely charming. Great place to go for a morning walk and take in all the beautiful craftsman era homes built in the early 1900\\'s.  Would definitely recommend for that authentic Seattle experience with a private space to (website hidden) Debbie\\'s Magdalena\\'s are the type of dessert that you want to keep to yourself and not share (: Best AirbnB stay ever. Ever.\\nDebbie was a perfect host- provided all pertinent info ahead of time, responded quickly to our questions and was willing to accommodate our schedule.\\nOnce we arrived, we were blown away how clean, comfortable and private the guest was. Debbie thought of every detail- down to a lovely welcome note. \\nWe will definitely stay here any one we\\'re in Seattle. Eric and I both loved Ballard! It was a great place to stay in Seattle. Debbie had great suggestions on things to do and where to eat. We stopped by Golden Gardens and ate pizza at Dulancey, both of which we would recommend. Debbie was a great communicator and we loved the muffins. Thank you again for having us! Hopefully we will be back in Seattle sooner than later. Debbie\\'s place is amazing! It looks and feels just like the photos. The room came complete with oatmeal, coffee, apples, orange juice and scones with jam the next morning. I loved the space, the neighborhood and the backyard. Next time I\\'m in Ballard, I will definetly be staying here! Thanks Debbie!  Debbie\\'s guest house was the nicest room we\\'ve ever stayed in- airbnb, hotel, or otherwise. Absolutely recommended for anyone staying in the area. It\\'s a quick drive to central Seattle, located in a beautiful neighborhood, and provided all the qualities of the \"ideal\" place to stay. Debbie provided a binder full of answers to every question we could\\'ve had and recommendations of places to go nearby. Coffee and snacks were included, along with the perfect balance of privacy and accessibility. Thank you so much for letting us stay in your fantastic home Debbie, couldn\\'t have asked for a nicer visit anywhere. I would pay money to be able to give her 6 stars. Thanks Debbie.  You made everything easy and comfortable...as it should be while traveling!\\r\\nCheers. Debbie. Oh Debbie. I didn\\'t get to meet her but my partner did and he thought the world of her. Upon my arrival. I notice the room looked much better in person than the pictures. She left notes for everything you could ever wonder. Sweet welcome notes. I loved that! She stocked the fridge with yummy goodies, the place was fresh clean and airy, color scheme perfect! Her homemade scones in the morning. Where to die for!!! It was nice not to have to leave the room for breakfast. The lace has great energy! I highly recommend it!! Debbie is an awesome host and we had a wonderful experience at her place. As a fellow Airbnb host, I truly appreciated all of the little things that made it a great experience.  Debbie\\'s place was great. Could not have asked for a more welcoming host. Located really close to the hip Ballard strip where there are lots of great places to eat, drink and shop. If I\\'m back in Seattle I definitely would like to stay with Debbie :)  Our stay with Debbie was a very short one but it was certainly memorable. The room is located behind Debbie\\'s beautiful Ballard home in a very nice back yard. The room was impeccable, the mattress was incredibly comfy and the bathroom was very clean. Debbie left out snacks and coffee, which we definitely enjoyed. We had to leave very early the next morning and unfortunately missed out on her famous scones. We will definitely stay with her again on our next visit to Seattle. Debbie made us feel welcome even prior to our arrival. She consistently communicated with us and provided suggestions before we even made it to Seattle. She welcomed us with a smile and freshly baked scones! Her place was perfectly situated for us to take some nice runs along the waterfront and through the neighborhood. The room was perfect. Overall, we had a lovely stay and would return.  Debbie\\'s cozy retreat was lovely and so clean and fresh. \\nAll the amenities of a large hotel. \\nWifi, flat screen,  wonderful bed extra pillows and blankets , coffee with French press, goodies in frig. My first morning here I was served home made scones! \\nDebbie also provides a binder full of info regarding local eateries. On my next visit to Seattle I am hoping Debbie\\'s guest retreat will be available! Thank you Debbie! It was an amazing experience! Matthew and I both loved the location. It was quite and relaxing, so many personal touches to the room. It felt like it was our own private apt! From personal note left for us and treats, to scones in the morning, and everything was as seen in the photos too! Easy access to downtown and meeting up with friends. We will stay here anytime it\\'s open while in Seattle! So welcoming, it felt seeing friend! Having wifi and being able to work as needed also was great. I have not enough praise for the hospitality! This was my first time using air bnb and what a wonderful first time experience! Debbie was awesome and very accommodating - even providing treats like scones, tea and oranges for us to enjoy! It was our first time in Seattle and made the trip so special. The bed was so comfortable, room was clean and even cable tv.  Alles super. Wenn alle so wären wie Debbie, würden wir im Paradies leben. We found Debbie\\'s room was extremely clean and everything was as it looks in the post.  It was in a great location and was a very comfortable stay.  We would definitely go back again. We felt at home. Debbie is a great and friendly person. The room and bathroom  are very clean. This place is perfect for 2 people, and a kid would be fine. Safe and clean neighborhood.  Would definitely stay here again.  Very nice private room with all the necessary accommodations. Detailed instructions for everything - much appreciated. Great neighborhood, easy access to Seattle/Ballard. Debbie made me, my husband and 10 month-old son feel welcome as soon as we arrived. She baked us scones from scratch for our first morning there, suggested lots of ideas for places to visit and neighborhoods to explore, and was happy to answer any questions we had. The rental is in a lovely neighborhood that was a couple blocks away from the busier streets and was very quiet. We loved staying here and would gladly stay here again. The rental is small, very clean, and nicely decorated. It\\'s the perfect space for one or two travelers, but also worked out great for us having our baby with us.  This was a great location to our daughter, a very private room, clean and comfortable. We will definitely try to stay here again, Great coffee and scones in the morning. Debbie was friendly and communicated well. Thanks for a great experience.  Everything was fantastic! We stayed two different times during the same week. We had an excellent experience! Our other review is a little more detailed!  Our stay at Debbie\\'s was great! Exactly as described and spotless! She wasn\\'t actually there while we were there but it was totally easy to get into the room and she was great with communicating. Ballard is a great neighborhood and we had fun!  Loved our stay at Debbie\\'s, it was our first time using Airbnb and my first time to Seattle. We wanted to stay somewhere close to UW and this was about 15-20 minutes away which worked great. The neighborhood was sweet, the room is a seperate little getaway behind the house sitting in the gorgeous backyard. We appreciated the clean, modern cute room and all the necessary amenities you need, including coffee & tea, and lots of other things. Wish we could of stayed longer than just one night and enjoy a meal in the backyard or seen more of the area, but had a tight schedule. Thank you for a great first experience! Debbie greeted us personally and made sure that we had everything we needed. The description of the \\'cottage\\' was very accurate. It is such a cute little place, so quiet and peaceful. The heated floors are fantastic! And the scones were an extra special treat! Even the little notes explaining how things work are perfect!~very clear and thorough!   The hosts description of the property was perfect.  Neighborhood beautiful and very quiet; room and equipment clean.  Debbie is very\\r\\nfriendly!  I had an exceptional stay!    Very nice room & easy to reach with public transportation. Perfect for a (much too short) stopover. Can this be our home away from home? \\r\\n\\r\\nOur flight  later than expected, and Debbie was very flexible for us to arrive when we were ready. The private entrance was convenient and didn\\'t make us feel like we were intruding. Debbie also sent us a well rounded instructions list, so there wasn\\'t any guess work getting situated. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe place is awesome, its a small converted room, but the bed was awesomely comfortable. There\\'s a TV, plenty of lighting, fantastically smelling amenities in the bathroom, and a mini-fridge with snacks, and coffee. Seriously? This is the best of a BnB and a hotel room, she even has that little luggage holder in there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning, she greeted me and gave me a good tip on where to go on a morning run in the neighborhood, and she had handmade scones for us in the morning. No joke, these are better than I get in more breakfast joints. She was also very nice and we got a chat for a moment on our way out in the early afternoon. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur only issue? We didn\\'t stay longer with her! If all our experiences were like staying with Debbie, I would be okay with never staying in a hotel for the rest of my life.  Debbie is an amazing host! I stayed for one night with my partner and we felt very welcomed by her kind hospitality. The room is beautiful, clean, and extremely cozy - I would compare it to a very nice hotel stay. Debbie is very thoughtful and prepared a binder full of nice restaurant and sight-seeing suggestions and also baked us delicious scones for breakfast!\\r\\nHer home is conveniently located in Ballard, Seattle and is close to downtown. I will definitely recommend anyone to stay here!  Only a brief stay, but it is a great place. Just as advertised- private bedroom with bath, nicely appointed. Debbie is terrific. Very accommodating and helpful. Debbie is very nice. And her house is comfortable. She is so kind to me. Thank you,Debbie~! Debbie was extremely welcoming and helpful throughout our stay.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBallard is a beautiful place to be in a beautiful city and there are lots of great places to eat within walking distance. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighbourhood is very safe and very welcoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is easy to access the rest of the city via public transport, though this was a problem for me for me because I had hurt my back. Debbie was a wonderful host! This was a fantastic first Airbnb experience for me. The room was lovely and very true to the photos and descriptions, but even more charming in person! Debbie\\'s scones, coffee, suggestions on where to explore in Ballard, and overall hospitality was absolutely perfect. I\\'m sad I couldn\\'t stay longer! Debbie was awesome. The private detached room in her backyard is beautiful and very cozy. It is in a very cute neighborhood which made our stay in Seattle memorable . It is close to all amenities and downtown.  Really beautiful location and guest house. It was so clean and smelled incredible. The bed is so comfortable and it was really peaceful. Debbie goes above and beyond to make the place comfortable. She leaves snacks, chocolates, tea, coffee. Debbie was easy to coordinate with. Appreciated how simple it was and the privacy.  Deb greeted us warmly.  Her cottage was clean and very comfortable.  The neighborhood was quiet.  We will return! This listing was everything we needed, and everything we didnt think we did. The bed is amazingly comfortable which made it easy for us to wind down and rest. Not to mention Debbies delicious morning scones and afternoon cookies! Stay here. You will only make great memories. Debbie is an amazing host. She is easy to communicate w and super sweet (even offer bake goods in the morning!) Her room is clean and provides absolute privacy. The bed is very comfy. I\\'ll highly recommend it! We had a fabulous stay at Debbie\\'s cute garden house - the place is in a great location, clean, and very comfortable. Debbie had lots of little snacks for us in the house, and even brought us home-made scones in the morning, which were delicious. Highly recommend to stay at Debbie\\'s if you are planing a Seattle trip! Debbie did a great job of communicating -- emails, welcome letter, and greeting me at the door when I arrived. She also accommodated my request to have the room ready a little early. The room itself was perfect for my needs--and incredibly, impeccably clean. I had an amazing night of rest with the black out shades! Thank you Debbie! I would love to return on my next trip to Seattle. Everything was wonderful. Host, space and vibe were all awesome... The small things count and there were plenty, clean and inviting, well stocked and highly enjoyable place to spend the night. Thank you Debbie It was a pleasure to deal with and meet Debbie.  The room was everything it was advertised to be and we felt very comfortable there.  We hope to have a longer stay in a future visit. We had such a fabulous time in Seattle! Debbie was a fabulous host and the room is so much better than any hotel. Comfortable and has everything you could need! Such a great location (Ballard is fab!) and easy access to the city! Thank you for having us!  We really enjoyed Debbie\\'s place! It was very clean, current, and comfortable. The neighborhood was nice and quiet, with updated homes and mature growth trees. Debbie stocked the room with lots of wonderful extras for comfort, and delivered yummy fresh baked scones in the morning to enjoy with our coffee (excellent too!). Everything we needed was there. We appreciated her friendly, brief greeting! We\\'ve stayed other places where the host camps out to gab on the doorstep when you\\'re tired and want to settle in. She made sure everything was ready and cooled the room for us prior to arrival. :-) We will be back! This is a great, quiet neighborhood to have a rest after you\\'re out running around Seattle like me! Perfect for one person or a couple, and being separated from the main house means you get a bit of privacy. The bed is so comfortable, and Debbie has thoughtfully provided everything that I thought I would need and more. Her scones were ridiculously good too. One of the best Airbnb places I\\'ve stayed at, and I would stay here again!  Debbie was so sweet! And her scones were delicious! The room was perfect. Private entrance with a bathroom and just enough space. There were little notes all around the room to let me know anything I should know. I will definitely be using her services again!  Debbie is a wonderful host. She was very reactive on emails/texts. We missed our flight and arrived at 4am, she was very comprehensive and reassuring. The room is just perfect and the private entrance very convenient. We parked easily in front of the house and reached Seattle downtown in 15min. We had a perfect stay. Debbie\\'s place is wonderful and she was a great host! The room is cozy, spacious, super clean and quiet and had everything we needed- including yummy homemade scones! Debbie was very accommodating, even providing us with an iron and ironing board so we wouldn\\'t have to wear wrinkly clothes to a wedding. The neighborhood is really close to both Green Lake and Ballard and is easy to navigate around- especially if you have a car. Highly recommend.  The room was exactly as it appeared in Airbnb. What a gem of a place in a nice neighborhood in North Ballard. Less than 5 minutes to the D bus stop that would get you to downtown Ballard or downtown Seattle. A great place from which to explore.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Debbie was a great host. She was very welcoming, and she even made scones for me for breakfast! All in all, it was exactly as I hoped and a great trip to Seattle. We had an enjoyable stay at Debbie\\'s place and everything was as Debbie described.  The treat on the first morning was very welcome.  The neighbourhood was quiet and public transport was close by. Debbie was wonderful. Very accommodating and helpful. The room was clean and made us feel at home. The weather was hot the week we traveled to Seattle so Debbie setup multiple fans to keep us cool. Highly recommend staying here as the room was perfect and location was great. Nothing but positives Debbie was a wonderful and friendly host. The room was comfortable and clean. We really appreciated the delicious scones she made for us. a stellar hostess! Debbie was very accomodating, and her welcome letter was very thorough, answering any questions we had before and during the stay. parking was ample and the studio was extremely clean. couldn\\'t have asked for a better first experience with Airbnb! thanks a million! Debbie is very nice and considerate. Delicious scones~ Thank you~! We had a great time at Debbie\\'s room. Great location, and the room was cozy and perfect for our stay. We  also loved the scones and the breakfast treats she provided. Her dogs were also very sweet. Thanks for a wonderful stay Debbie! Debbie was a phenomenal host! She left detailed notes about the room and the area which made our stay very convenient. She had even installed a portable A/C because of the unseasonably hot weather. The room felt like a hotel and was completely separated from the house. It was also located just a couple blocks to a bus line downtown. It was awesome to have a Welcome Packet (with a chocolate) waiting for me when I checked in. I didn\\'t get to meet Debbie but the room was very comfortable, bathroom was REALLY nice, and there was even oatmeal packets for the morning. The bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood is safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing that was not superb was the A/C unit. It was very kind of Debbie to buy given the hot summer this year but it\\'s loud and not very effective. But hey, it\\'s better than nothing (even though it was too loud for light sleeper like me so I left it off). That being said, next time I come to Seattle to visit friends, I will DEFINITELY be asking Debbie if I can stay again. Debbie was very helpful and friendly, and the room was very private and comfortable! The room was charming, clean and notes from the host were helpful.  The host was welcoming and made the experience easy and restful.  The bed is extremely comfortable.  The location is perfect as it is close to public transportation, and yet quiet and peaceful.  The touches provided by the host were thoughtful and made the room feel very welcoming.  I highly recommend this site.   We had a wonderful stay at Debbie’s guest bungalow! First off, my impression of Debbie began many months before arriving. I truly felt we chose the right host and home. She was always quick to respond and stay in communication with us, beginning at booking right through our stay, then through our departure.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDebbie\\'s home was our last stop on our PNW vacation and it was definitely the cherry on our vacation \"sundae\". We had been visiting family in Wenatchee and didn\\'t leave their home as early as we hoped ~ then we stopped to take a hike in the mountains, which took longer than anticipated. That being said, I felt badly because we ended up arriving at Debbie\\'s home a few hours later than anticipated. When I sent her a message to let her know, she was super easy going and still ensured we felt quite welcomed upon our arrival, despite not being home when we arrived. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe private detached guest house is located in an adorably quaint, safe and hip neighborhood which is also a comfortable distance to Seattle and, of course, very near local and surrounding neighborhood restaurants and sights. Parking at her home was a breeze, which is hard to say about “the city”. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe space itself was bright, modern, extremely efficient and impeccably clean…which made this neat-freak very happy. The bed was comfy and all the linens she provides are soft, smelled nice and high quality. \\r\\n\\r\\nDebbie has great taste in décor and we could see she also values quality and comfort. Everything you need is provided by her, from natural bathroom toiletries to wine glasses & wine opener. She even created a much appreciated, spot-on handbook of local restaurants and directions for your stay in her home! We were fortunate enough to be able to try several places on her lists and they did not disappoint. (We are a bit obsessed with The Walrus and The Carpenter now. Morsel and The Fat Hen are also a must!) \\r\\n\\r\\nDebbie also makes sure you have a nice cup of coffee or tea with some breakfast in your belly by providing breakfast items in the room to fix at your leisure, along with all the dishes and cups you need. One of our mornings, she baked amazing blueberry scones for us. Who knew scones could be so light and fluffy? I usually don’t eat breakfast pastries, and if I do, I only nibble a portion...but this one I devoured, much to my Hubby\\'s shock and dismay! \\r\\n\\r\\nI can\\'t say enough about how nice she is and her home is, but I\\'m running out of characters. I\\'ll end with ~ it was lovely to be able to chat with her, while petting her cute doggies, the morning of our departure. We were very sad to leave but will be sure to see if we can stay with her again next time we visit. Thank you, Debbie, for an amazing experience!!! Oh my goodness...we cannot say enough nice things about our stay with Debbie. We arrived in the late afternoon and everything was ready and waiting for us. Everything from the shampoo to the coffee provided was top shelf. The bed was comfortable. The room was quiet and Debbie\\'s neighborhood was charming. We ran to a Crossfit gym about 5 minutes away from the house and when we got back Debbie had freshly baked blueberry scones waiting for us. They were amazing. \\r\\n\\r\\nHer area of Ballard is a little bit out of the way from Seattle but easily accessible by bus or Uber. The D Line bus runs all the way up and down 15th street from basically Debbie\\'s front door to the heart of Seattle. There are also lots of fun things to do in Ballard. The Brouwer\\'s Cafe, a Belgian beer bar, was one of our favorite stops on our trip and was a about 7 minutes by bus or Uber.  Debby\\'s room is private, peaceful, beautifully designed and decorated with a very comfortable bed. We will definitely try to stay here again the next time we come to Ballard. Thank you Debby! This airbnb is in a lovely residential neighborhood in Ballard. Our host Debbie was great at communicating in the days leading up to our stay. The suite is exactly what it looks like and is the perfect spot for a couple or single traveler. Debbie has thought of everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible from shampoo, air con, luggage stands, and she graciously made us scones in the morning (which were too delicious). We will definitely stay here again! Debbie was immediately a very warm and welcome hostess. She guided us around her property, answering a few questions and showing us the essentials we needed to come back and clean up from a long week of camping in the Pacific Northwest. Her guest house is immaculate and cozy, with lots of literature - including her own - on things to do and see around Ballard and Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of Ballard: It is a fantastic area, one that reminded us greatly of our home back in Minneapolis. Friendly people with many unique and tasty restaurants to sample. We are looking forward to a return trip in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Debbie! \\r\\nDeb, our host was very welcoming and met us in person. She checked to make sure we were settled and had all expectations clearly stated for food, cleaning, and arrival/departures. She also was of great assistance when we needed ice for a medical issue. We would highly recommend this airbnb site! This stay was just as wonderful as the other two times we\\'ve stayed here. Debbie is a super hostess and the room is very quiet, comfortable and peaceful.  Deb was an excellent, welcoming host! She made everything about our stay super easy. Room was great, especially French press coffee. Thank you! \\n\\n   Debbie was very welcoming. She left notes around the house that were good reminders for us, which is helpful when traveling can be a whirlwind. She had a great booklet of information on local tourist attractions, shops, restaurants, and things to see. The room was accurately described and quite private, which was perfect for my sister and I. We would definitely recommend staying at Debbie\\'s if you are ever in the mood to visit Seattle or surrounding areas. Thanks, Debbie!! This little cottage is consistently peaceful, relaxing, and comfortable. We\\'ve stayed here several times.  It\\'s in a very quiet neighborhood that is convenient to public transportation.  Debbie is an excellent hostess! I had a wonderful stay at the Air B&B, hosted by Debbie.  My place was cozy, clean & very comfortable.  My host, Debbie was very sweet and kind.  My husband celebrated a birthday, while at the B&B and she made homemade scones with a candle.  Very thoughtful.  The location was very convenient to both downtown Ballard and my son\\'s home.  A great stay... Thank you for the great hospitality. Cheerful, sweet place in a terrific location with easy parking and access- and a very friendly and accommodating hostess who clearly enjoys that role.  Concise for sure, but we like that kind of coziness.  Couldn\\'t wish for anything more.  The privacy is such a bonus- my husband could play his ukulele first thing in the morning without worries of disturbing the household!  Like like like!!!     Debbie was very easy to communicate with and the description was very accurate. The neighborhood was a nice quite neighborhood and was just a quick drive to downtown Ballard (maybe 1.5 miles if you\\'re walking). Debbie was in the backyard when we arrived and gave us a very welcoming greeting and even offered to make us fresh scones the next morning. The detached bedroom was private, had an a/c unit in it, full bathroom, TV, books, wi-fi, and even a handy book that Debbie made filled with nearby restaurants and things to do. 10/10 would stay here again.  Splendid little room and great value! This was perfect for our one-night stopover in Seattle. It was tastefully designed, immaculate, and stocked with high-quality essentials (such soft and plush towels!). Debbie was an extraordinary host, from baking fresh scones to accommodating our travel schedule. We enjoyed our stay at Debs place.\\nShe was friendly and the room was as described.A great neighborhood\\nIn a quiet part of Seattle. This was such a great stay!  The accommodations were peaceful, clean and comfortable.  Debbie was very attentive, responsive and accommodating.  She made the most delicious scones for us as well! Debbie is lovely and very personable. Even though we didn\\'t see much of each other. As my husband and I were out all day as night enjoying the wonderful city. \\r\\nThe accommodation was wonderful too and had all that you would need.  Very clean and comfortable.  Debbie  added a few goodies to the fridge. Inc her yummy home made scones.  I would definitely return  and I wouldn\\'t  hesitate to recommend Debbie\\'s place to anyone else. \\r\\n Debbie was very organized and easy-going. She sent us email/text way in advance with all the information to keep us in the loops. The night we arrived she was out but sent us a text to let us know. Love the privacy of the detached room. Things were clean and neat. It was very simple yet very accommodating. The brochure she prepared was very detailed with recommendations from local eateries to things to see/do complete with hand-drawn directions. Debbie even offered to bake us some scones in the morning. We were very comfortable staying with Debbie and she was a nice host. I\\'d stay at Debbie\\'s again when we visit Ballard/Seattle.  My host Debbie made me feel very welcome and even had fresh scones at my doorstep the very first morning I awoke!  the bedroom and bath is very clean and comfortable.  I enjoyed the peacefulness as it is a very quiet neighborhood.  I asked her to provide de-caf coffee as there was none, and she agreed that she would.   I would definitely rent Debbie\\'s little house again when in Seattle, close to bus stop and walk to breakfast café.\\r\\nThank you Debbie!    Mary Debbie was a great Host. Her cottage provides comfot and privacy. The location ideal because it is near the Sound with great views and restaurants. I would definitely recommend it! Debbie\\'s place is exactly as described - it is a great little gust house in a wonderful neighborhood, very convenient to everything!  Deb was very communicative prior to our arrival and provided all the comforts of home during our stay!  This was our first Airbnb stay - after staying here, we may never use statndard hotels again!! We stayed with Deb twice since we had a \"trip within a trip\" to a wedding outside of town.  Deb was gracious about our strange schedule and when we arrived for Our Stay, Part II - we received the royal treatment all over again!  The room is a perfect for a couple and is so convenient to all things Seattle - and if you need some suggestions, Deb provides a great book for fun local places to please all types of visitors.  And bonus for us - we got homemade scones for both of our stays!!  Truly above and beyond!   Our host, Debbie, did an excellent job of making us feel welcome, from answering all my questions quickly, to preparing warm, tasty scones the morning after our arrival! We felt like family the moment we met her! The room was clean and comfortable and we loved the area (Ballard) or this B & B. Lots of fun, local restaurants, pubs, and coffee houses within a short jaunt! Debbie was wonderful and super accommodating!  When you talk to her, she makes you feel very welcomed.  Her house is absolutely gorgeous.   When we stayed with her, she definitely provided us with a homie feeling.  She also provides a lot of helpful tips and good places to eat and visit.  If I do go to Seattle again, I\\'ll definitely try to stay at her place again.    Debbie was super nice and made us fresh scones for breakfast. Debbie was a great host! She contacted me very promptly while I was making arrangements and sent an email prior to arriving to give directions and general information regarding our stay. My boyfriend and I were visiting for my sister\\'s wedding and were seeking a more private stay since we were going to be busy running around. The location was near the venue (golden gardens) and in a great area! Close to many restaurants and fun things to check out. We only saw Debbie a few times but she was very friendly each time :) we had the privacy and quiet we wanted and it felt like a small home away from home. She also let us come a bit earlier than stated since we needed to change and get ready before the rehearsal dinner and didn\\'t put pressure for us to be out at exactly 11. Thank you so much Debbie! We had a great stay! We spent a great night at Debbie\\'s. Ballard is a very quiet and nice  district. Notice that you need to take the bus or your car to go downtown as it\\'s a long way to go by foot. The room is lovely and we tasted delicious fresh scones in the  morning.  Debbie is really careful: she  gave us some very useful traffic information as Chinese President Xi was visiting Seattle. We recommend  her room for a trip in Seattle. Perfect room, VERY CLEAN, great location in Ballard and easy parking. Debbie is a great host, her dogs are wonderful and we had a fantastic time. We stayed on two different days and the second day Debbie really helped us by allowing to check in a little earlier. Yes, it is a small room but enough space for luggage and clothing.\\r\\nDebbie, thank you for making us welcome! Debbie was great: alert, accommodating and attentive without being intrusive. Her place was comfortable, quiet and private, with plenty of street parking out front. Instructions and directions were complete and fully comprehensible, and there were lots of nice little touches--including (but not limited to) the home-made muffins provided without fanfare. She even thoughtfully covered the bicycle I\\'d locked in the yard when it started to rain overnight. Sweet!\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'d caution that although comfortable and complete, the lodging might have fallen short if I\\'d intended to cook for myself or if I\\'d wanted to spend time outside. This was not a drawback for me, but might have been if I\\'d needed space to work or if I\\'d not been alone. This is not intended as a criticism, but rather as a caution to be realistic about what\\'s included. Considering the price, location, and amenities this was definitely a good deal. I\\'ll be back! Wow!  Our stay at Debbie\\'s place was great!! She was the perfect hostess.  The neighborhood was super cute!  We walked to several bars & restaurants.  Her house was adorable!  The guest house looked exactly like it does in the pictures.  \\nDebbie was so nice and accommodating.  We thought we needed an early check-in so she made arrangements to make that happen for us.  She even had a list of \"To-Do\\'s\" for both the area of Ballard & all of Seattle.\\n\\nThank you so much Debbie!  We would most definitely recommend your place to anybody looking for a great place to stay in Seattle!  Hopefully we\\'ll be back soon! We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay.  Our private room exceeded our expectations-Debbie goes above & beyond making sure that every ammenity is available to you. Her homemade breakfast scones will seal the deal!  We were able to store our bikes in her garage & enjoyed the backyard patio area.  Her location is perfect if you want to visit Seattle Center-by car or public bus. We were able to enjoy the Ballard neighborhood too!  We will definitely stay here again if we come back to Seattle. i would definitely recommend this place! it is a nice, clean, private rental with a really cosy bed. it\\'s located in a beautiful neighbourhood with walking distance to hip restaurants. nice and uncomplicated host! unfortunately we stayed there just for one night I loved my stay.  Nice and clean.  Quiet and beautiful neighbor.  Easy walk to the bus stop with multiple pieces of luggage.  Meet Debbie and she was so sweet and I would have to say she went out of her way to make sure I had everything I need.  Seriously delicious scones.   Our stay at Debbie\\'s private detached room was great! From the beginning of booking, Debbie was prompt in her replies and sent great detailed information about everything we could expect which only complimented the already detailed listing she has for her AirBnB. The neighborhood is quiet, but only a short walk to a charming street filled with great bars and restaurants. Downtown Ballard is a short drive or bus ride away. The room was very charming, clean and contained everything we needed for our mini-staycation. Debbie even left blueberry scones outside the door for us in the morning. I highly recommend her private room and Debbie, herself, as a great host. Debbie greeted my husband and I when we arrived to her home. She was very friendly and kind. The room was great. Definitely fits only 2 people max. The room was clean, organized and comfortable. We were very pleased with our 4 night stay. We had a very good time staying at Debbie\\'s place. It was our first time visiting Seattle and we found her local travel recommendations very informative and helpful. The room itself was very clean and fully equipped. Love the scones she made for us before we leave!  Excellent experience.  Debbie was quite welcoming, the room was separate from the house and well furnished, equipped and provisioned, and the location was great----lots of coffee shops, restaurants, etc. nearby.  -----highly recommended! As first time Airbnb users we were a bit apprehensive, but we could not have had a better, or more relaxed night at Debbie\\'s. We truly lucked out. The room was beautiful and clean. Debbie was the perfect host, kind and helpful but respected our privacy. Anything you could ever need, she has ready at your fingertips. There are fantastic spots to eat within a mile. The cherry on top was definitely the yummy homemade scones! Couldn\\'t have asked for a better host, we will be back! Very very nice accommodation.  New, well-appointed, private. Neighborhood seemed fine. Our host made us feel very welcome. This is a detached accommodation that was completely private. It is very clean with everything we needed. This is a lovely neighborhood. This is close to public transportation and many destinations within walking distance. \\r\\nThis was a great experience. We recommend this host and location. Debbie\\'s guest cottage was peaceful and relaxing - well appointed room, nice mattress, plenty of hot water for two back to back showers in the morning. Great location in the Ballard neighborhood, too! Really great place!  Very well appointed, really liked the welcome book with dining suggestions.  Everything was clean and in very nice condition.  And I really loved the privacy. When I come up to Seattle again will definitely stay here! Everything was great about my stay. Very nice large and comfortable private detached accommodations. Really appreciated Debbie\\'s touches with everything one could need. Liked the neighborhood and quick access to downtown Seattle. Debbie\\'s instructions plus house rules are excellent. Lots of care has gone into her BnB.\\r\\nI\\'ve stayed in several places within this price range but this was the best. I absolutely loved this place! It was so clean and cozy and exactly like the pictures. The house is very nice and modern. When I got in there was snacks and a few drinks in the mini fridge and a hot tea kettle top of fridge. I will definitely stay here again because it was private and quiet and just overall very pleasant.  What a lovely room, and a wonderful host! Debbie made our first Air BnB experience a great one. The room was spacious and well furnished with a great selection of hot teas, coffee and a few other snacks. The location in Ballard is awesome and within walking distance to several local eateries and coffee shops, and only a few blocks from the bus stop that goes downtown Seattle.   Debbie has put together a wonderful travel guide of the area and local restaurant and hot spots. I can\\'t say enough how pleased we were with our choice to stay at Debbies. From the first communication to the time we left she made us feel welcome and like family. Debbie is a great host. I have visited twice and will return. The place is clean, quiet and comfortable. I love the location. Debbie met us upon arrival and was warm and welcoming. She made us feel comfortable to be staying at her place. The neighbourhood was very easy to find, directions were very accurate and close to Ballard, what a great neighbourhood. The detached place was exactly what was listed. It was very clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and all the little extras made us feel right at home. Would definitely stay there again ! thanks Debbie. The place was very cozy and in a quiet neighbourhood.  There as a comfy bed, clean bathroom with showering necessities provided, a walk-in closet for extra storage and some extras to make us feel at home (tea, coffee, homemade scones, juice, instant oatmeal, magazines and books, tv). We would definitely come back again the next time we\\'re in Seattle.   Debbie is a great host, she bakes delicious muffins. The room is in a quiet neighborhood and is well maintained. Overall a very pleasurable first night in Seattle. This was our first time using AirBnB.  We had a great experience! Debbie\\'s place was just as described; very clean, quiet and filled with lots of extras that made our stay more enjoyable. She really pays attention to the details. The homemade muffins were greatly appreciated. We\\'re afraid she may have spoiled us for future rentals. Thank you Debbie! Debbie was great. We had a great time staying here for a wedding that we were going to in Seattle. It was nice to have a private entrance and Debbie was respectful of our privacy. She was so great when we had a few different situation that come up that were less than ideal. She was accommodating and kind. The scones that she made were delicious as well. It was a great stay and I would stay here again. It was a little out of the way of where we had to go for the wedding but it was worth it.  Great space and experience. The room is very cozy and private. Hope to stay with Debbie again. This visit was great. Debbie is wonderful. So kind and courteous. My wife and I felt very safe and comfortable with her. The room was more than we needed or even imagined. All the extra hospitalities were great! Definitely recommended!! The guest room is very cozy and private！Debbie is super nice and thoughtful, and she provides some pumpkin breads for the first morning. Hope to stay with Debbie again! We had a great time during our stay! The detached garage room felt like we were in nice hotel- and the heated floors were an added bonus. \\r\\nDebbie brought us delicious scones the second morning, and waking up to see dogs in the back yard made it feel more like home. It was a great neighborhood, with a lovely little spot called the Fat Hen, where we discovered our new favorite coffee drink- a cortado.  Debbie is awesome! She went out of her way to help us celebrate my partner\\'s birthday, she made us some homemade scones and gave us a candle to boot! For me this kind of service is rare nowadays, so to have a host that\\'s this thoughtful is a breath of fresh air. The detached bedroom space is great, we were free to move in and out without disturbing our host. It was also so easy to catch the D train going to the city so we saw a lot of what Seattle has to offer without having to drive and pay $$$$ in parking fees. I will definitely recommend Debbie and would stay with her again. Thank you Debbie!  Perfect, quiet and private space that feels like an oasis in the city.  Debbie\\'s space is warmly welcoming, easily accessible, and comfortable.  Thank you! We were planning a week-end in Seattle, but wanted to avoid the busy downtown. We found this perfect spot in Ballard, which was an great opportunity to discover a very friendly neighborhood with plenty of shops, restaurants and bars. The place was very cozy, clean, quiet and warm. We haven\\'t had the chance to meet Debbie but she provides very great advice on where to go and what to see.  We definitely recommend this place. I very much enjoyed staying at Deb\\'s place. I was very impressed with the care she took to make sure I felt welcome. She had many little touches that made me feel at home, such as the French press, the items in the mini-fridge and the wonderful products in the bathroom. I liked the inclusion of a \"manual\" which answered all my questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room is lovely, warm, and tastefully appointed. The bed is very comfortable, and that’s saying a lot for me because I always have pain in my back. I loved the comforter, sheets and pillows. It was like a four-star hotel. My night’s sleep was great. Fresh homemade bread in frig and mints on bedside table with a small note saying \\'welcome\\'. Debbie\\'s place was great! Very clean, comfortable, quiet, great neighborhood. We would definitely stay there again. No downsides at all. It was exactly as we expected.  Debbie greeted us when we arrived. She was friendly and inviting. The suite was even more cozy than expected -- would stay again! It was a short drive to downtown Ballard, which is highly recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\nScones were delicious and unexpectedly served as our only breakfast as we rushed to the airport -- what a life saver! Great set up and quiet \\'hood. Thanks! We thoroughly enjoyed our experience in Ballard.  Debbie\\'s very quiet detached unit was an oasis for us after a long haul from Shanghai.  She met us and made us feel welcome immediately and was in contact with us on an as-needed basis before and during our stay.  The room was clean as a whistle and the radiant heat in the floor was a real bonus.  We both felt the bed was one of best we\\'d ever had! Good coffee, oatmeal packs and scones put the finishing touches on our lovely stay.  Yep, we\\'d love to re-book. The listings of neighborhood sights, restaurants, etc was well organized and most helpful.  The Brunswick & Hunt Restaurant a couple of blocks away was superb!  Well done, Debbie. Debbie was a wonderful host, she left instructions and a very detailed suggestion list that proved to be very helpful. She made our stay very comfortable and even left us homemade scones! I\\'m a sucker for baked goods and they were fantastic! We had a great stay! My son and grandson stayed at Debbie\\'s place. I never met her, but my son met her only briefly and said they had a pleasant conversation. My son was very happy with the room, especially the location, which was very quiet and only a few minutes away from where we were staying. We had a great experience staying here!  The host was warm and welcoming, even though we never actually interacted in person.  The room was perfectly appointed with everything you could want.  It was very clean and just as described. Debbie\\'s bnb is \"the best\" just because of Debbie herself. She knows what it takes to make a house a home....even for a visitor.   Careful planning has created a welcoming little oasis independent living suite in her backyard garden. The details of her thouggtfulness are msny, many, many!!! The essentials....a very private, safe, warm, quiet place to rest. It is definitely not an extra bedroom in a basement sort of space. The entire place was absolutely spotlessly clean.  The bed is VERY comfortable and we\\'ll made. Beyond the essentials. I very much enjoyed her efforts to add many touches of hospitality and.....as a single example.... I enjoyed her offer of a yummy blueberry scone in the morning  with a pot of green tea. As I  sat reading a couple \"Seattle\" magazines from her book shelf, I reminisced about my former life in Seattle and thought about how nice her comfy chair and good reading lamp would allow a Seattle \"Tourist visitor\" to get a sense of the town and relax. The little fridge provided a proper storage place for a few meal items. She even provided a mini eating area. \\n\\nThe location is ideal for bus travelers, as the main bus for this part of town is only a block away. For people with a vehicle  there is very adequate parking. The shopping and night life of new Ballard is 5 minutes away, the natural environment Golden Gardens 10 minutes, as are the fish ladder, fisherman\\'s terminal and Shilshole Marina and the most interesting Hiram Crittenden Locks.\\n\\nDebbie always communicates efficiently and in a very timely manner. Her book of house info is helpful. She is not a lady who leaves things  to chance.... thoughtful, intelligent, commited. It shows!! Debbie is Super nice and she prepared everything you need with a high quality! The room is warm and very clean. Cute dogs!  Rented this Guest Apt. for my daughter, her fiance and my 4 month old grandson who visited from Califorina. Diana is just wonderful and made them feel like family. The Browns Guest Apt. is just amazing. The back yard had a very country like feel. I live only a mile away and I want to stay here myself!!! This was a very good experence for both me and my family. I highly recomend it to anyone! I loved my stay at Diane\\'s.  It was my first stay using Air BnB and it inspired me to book another night.  Her place is clean and tidy with a lovely yard to walk out onto in the morning after the paper and a cup of coffee.  Fresh eggs in the refrig was the topping on the cake.  A great place to stay.  Margo Great little place to stay with an excellent yard to enjoy while you\\'re there (weather permitting). Loved the chickens & the cats (not allowed in the apartment). Diana is very helpful & accommodating and provides fresh eggs and other breakfast essentials. We did notice a little noise from the bedroom and bathroom, but it didn\\'t get in our way at all. Overall, a lovely place to stay while in Seattle! Browns House was an amazing retreat for my boyfriend and I! Exactly what we were looking for... cozy and quiet, while still close to town. And fresh eggs from the chickens out back! We have definitely found our go-to Seattle home base and look forward to our next stay! Diana\\'s \\'caretaker\\'s flat\\' is a warm and friendly place to stay and a haven from the big city. Diana is a great host and can\\'t do enough for you. There is so much provided at this B&B (including food), that you want for nothing. Getting into the city was easy as pie - walk two blocks to the main bus route which takes you straight into the downtown area - and no problems coming home late either. We loved getting to know Diana and would definitely stay here again if we are ever in Seattle. We really enjoyed staying at Diana\\'s place in Ballard. It was cozy and charming, the bed was very comfortable, and Diana was friendly and thoughtful. We also enjoyed the beautiful flowers in the yard, the family chickens, and the lovely foods Diana provided in the fridge. We would love to stay there again any time. This B & B is very private. You have a kitchen, bath and bedroom. It is very clean and the host family is very friendly. \\r\\nI plan to stay there again when I visit my son. Diana\\'s apartment is very private. It is attached to a large heritage house and is quite spacious, with a separate bathroom, kitchen and bedroom. The fridge and kitchen were will stocked with organic eggs (her own), bread, milk, cereal, butter, coffee and most  things that you would need for a two-day stay, which is what we had. It was quite central to Ballard and not far from downtown Seattle. We definitely will return for another stay and highly recommend it to others. Diana\\'s sweet little apartment was the perfect getaway for our time in Seattle. She keeps the kitchen well stocked with delicious breakfast goodies, including some of the best eggs we\\'ve ever had (fresh from her chickens!). The yard is peaceful and feels private, and Diana is a friendly and generous host.  Great little place. As others mentioned, the fresh food was a great touch. Newspaper every morning was icing on the cake. Great location. All the yards in the area are full of beautiful flowers, so it\\'s a great place to get out and walk the neighborhood. The check in was momentarily bumpy when the designated door that was supposed to be unlocked wasn\\'t, but everything was resolved in less than 15 minutes. The place is comfortable, has a full kitchen and everything you\\'d need. Their back yard is lovely and relaxing. The location is not too far from various sites that you might want to visit in Seattle. Overall I would definitely recommend this place.  After several days of staying with friends, Diana\\'s mother-in-law apartment was a great respite. It\\'s is easy to reach by car but far enough from major highways to feel quiet and relaxed. The bed was extremely comfortable and the cozy space was certainly adequate for our needs. We ate breakfast (fresh eggs, milk, juice, coffee, tea, bread, butter, jams, and some fruit were all provided) in the beautiful backyard listening to the song birds and the clucking chickens. The amount of sound that carries from the main house into the guest apartment is about what you\\'d expect if you\\'ve ever lived in an apartment (sometimes a little kitchen conversation or a radio can be heard) -- though never unbearably loud and never at odd hours. Diana and Bill were attentive to our needs without ever being intrusive and we loved the Whittier Heights neighborhood (one of Seattle\\'s finest pizzeria\\'s is a short walk away -- make sure to check out Delancey!). Explain to me again why anyone would prefer to stay in a hotel over a great place like this? This was our first air b & b experience, and ... It was Fabulous!  Diana has created a wonderfully cozy, and very lovely home for us while we were in Seattle.  We loved the location just outside of the city (a somewhat quick bus ride @ 20+ minutes), or a quick drive if you like.  We spent some time downtown doing the traditional tourist things, and we found it more to our liking to play around in the different neighborhoods after we got our city fix ... Like downtown Ballard a nice little collection of shops/ restaurants, and we Loved our walk around Green Lake (eat at Dukes for some great food if you like), also the Gas works area is spectacular.   We would definitely recommend Diana and her Browns House guest apt.!   The back yard is a great way to relax into the morning or evening, and she stocked the fridge with a lot of goods to keep our taste buds entertained too.  Thank You Diana!  and family!  We had a great time!   We arrived at our overnight house at around 3 pm and fell in love with the place. Diana greeted us at the door with a big smile and a warm, friendly greeting. She showed us around the cute, clean mother-in-law suite that we were pleased to call home for the next two nights. She was cute! She was worried that the floor was not clean enough and that everything was not “just right” - it looked perfect to us!\\r\\n The property was wonderful and well-manicured! It has several garden areas with mature fruit trees, several sitting areas, grassy lawns, and flower patches everywhere we looked. Everything was perfect! We went to the store for a few light groceries and when we came back, Diana made a point to tell us that she is getting ready to go to the store to get our yogurt, fresh bread etc. We were shocked. The fridge already had a cute little pitcher of orange juice, one of milk, a basket of organic strawberries, oatmeal, three jars of jelly and half a dozen eggs from the chickens tucked in a corner of her gorgeous back yard. We laughed and thanked her for such “over the top” effort, but insisted that she had done too much already and that we needed nothing more. This woman is the epitome of a gracious hostess – a wonderful gal! We sent her off to relax with her husband and kids and we wandered the grounds admiring the property – we love it! Diana and Bill’s place is one of those places that will mess up your trip if you have places to be and things to see outside Seattle. What I mean by this is that if we did not have an itinerary, we probably would have stayed for the rest of the month - that’s how much we enjoyed Diana’s home, her hospitality and her company. She’s one of those hosts that is not intrusive, but is always willing to small-talk “out of towners” – a very gracious, sincere, generous and fun host. \\r\\n What a cute little space. It\\'s definitely got that country-charm, with splashes of vintage and French appeal. The bed is so comfortable, the kitchen is perfect to make eggs that Diana supplies from her own chickens - there was orange juice, coffee, tea, and she would have given more if I hadn\\'t stopped her! \\r\\n\\r\\nDiana is respectful of privacy and yet she somehow manages to be there when you need her without being intrusive. Also the location is very central and close to a lot of great neighborhoods in Seattle. Truly the relaxing stay I was looking for.  The Brown\\'s Guest House by Diana was such a sweet spot to land at the end of a long day.  The place was set up with care for every detail, immaculately clean and comfortable.  I slept peacefully and awoke to partake of Diana\\'s breakfast provisions: fresh strawberries and organic half-n-half for the french press coffee, which were enjoyed with her own backyard\\'s fresh eggs.   Thank you Diana!  I would recommend this experience to my friends and family.    We could not have been more content and delighted with our stay in Brown\\'s House Guest Apt.  We were visiting Seattle on business, but wanted to be near our niece who lives in Ballard.  The apt. was spotless and comfortable, the bed was great, and the refrigerator stocked with everything we needed and then some.  Diana is a generous person; we have already recommended her place to two friends! As my english is not that good i will however try to write some words about the apartment and the hosts.\\r\\nFirst of all \"book it\"!! You will not find anything better. Very nice family ( we started with a nice and informative talk (no smalltalk!!!) with Diana about nearly a hour) living in a wonderful neighberhood (Ballard is only a 10 - 15 min drive to Pike Place Market). \\r\\nThe apartment is a you see in the picture, there is nothing \"placed for the picture\", it is a really not small apartment where you can easily stay in more than a week. \\r\\n As a result i will definItely recommend this place to anyone i know traveling to Seattle.\\r\\nThanks Diana and family for creating such a nice place to stay, hope to see you again one time.  A great place to stay and a wonderful hostess. What a great spot!  Very comfortable.  Beautiful yard.  Great food, organic juice and cream for good coffee, kitchen is well outfitted.  My second stay and not my last.   This is a charming and lovely little hideaway spot. The hosts are gracious and welcoming, the accommodations well appointed. A charming little kitchen, a very nice bathroom, a lovely bedroom with a nice, comfy bed. If you are visiting Ballard or ever need a place to stay in that part of the city, this is an absolutely lovely choice. We enjoyed our stay at Browns house.  It is a cozy place with all the comforts of home.  Definitely recommend it. Diana was sweet, helpful, funny, unobtrusive yet still present.  The guesthouse was clean, quiet, superbly stocked with organic goodies.  The bed was comfy, the shower was hot I can\\'t say a single negative thing.  I will attempt to stay there every time I\\'m in Seattle! We had a super nice overnight at Diana\\'s and enjoyed our chat time with her.  We really appreciated her letting us bring our dog and allow the one-night - wish it could have been longer.  Had a wonderful walk in the neighborhood, perfect little kitchen and groceries provided by Diana and for a comfy morning - the Seattle rain didn\\'t matter a bit.  Loved the property - we will for sure stay again when we are in Seattle. Thank you so much for hosting us, Diana. The fresh eggs from her chickens were a treat for breakfast in the morning, as were the fresh fruits! We felt like very much at home and were able to relax on this much needed vacation.  Diana was nice, energetic and helpful. The apartment was clean and replete with goodies! Would stay again, cannot recommend highly enough.  Clean, quiet and comfortable suite... cute and a bit rustic. Diana has chickens in the back yard so fresh eggs were in the offer. Good location close to the shops and restaurants in Ballard. We only stayed one night but Diana was attentive and welcoming. Overall experience was positive and we would recommend the suite to anyone staying in Ballard or Seattle in general. Diana is a great host and we liked having the fresh eggs from her chickens for breakfast. We greatly enjoyed out stay at the Brown\\'s House... The guest house is pretty and comfortable, scrupulously clean, and has lots of thoughtful \\'extras\\' that make your stay that much nicer. Diana was friendly and welcoming. This is a great choice if you\\'re going to be in Seattle!\\r\\n\\r\\nFYI - we were traveling with an infant, and you can fit a pack-and-play in the bedroom corner easily if you need to. :) We enjoyed our stay so much, arrived to find a quaint cozy garden facing apartment. We hit the local Trader Joes and settled in and made it our home for 3 days. Diana has not missed any detail even little extras just to make sure you have all you need. She was very hospitable & her love for the neighborhood and area is infectious. The only thing I wish I did was to join her in the garden! Can\\'t wait to find a reason to head back to Seattle.  It was really nice of staying at Diana\\'s apartment. She is so helpful and hospitable. Easily check-in, nice yard, and quiet neighborhood. The apartment is prepared with juice, milk, fruits, toast, coffee&tea, and even fresh eggs! Feel like home! Only 15 mins drive from downtown seattle, no traffic even during the weekend. Overall such a wonderful experience! Will definitely stay here again next time I visit Seattle.  I had a wonderful time at the Browns House Guest Apt in Ballard, and would definitely stay there again!  I\\'m new to AirBnB, and not a super social traveler, so it was nice that Diana checked in to make sure I had everything I needed, but wasn\\'t otherwise up in my business.  The entrance is private, so I didn\\'t have to worry about troubling my hosts if I stayed out late or woke up early.  **  The fresh eggs and bread were an extra nice touch that helped me keep some of my eating expenses down and helped make sure I got some protein.  (Although I\\'ll have to remember not to run the toaster and the microwave at the same time! Oops!)  Diana included all the usual amenities you\\'d find at a hotel like soap and shampoo.  And the travel sewing kit in the bathroom vanity came in extra handy when I ripped a hole in my leggings!  ** Ballard is just north of Seattle, and is a nice sanctuary in an otherwise busy city.  The house is very close to the Rapid Ride D line that gets you right downtown, and it\\'s very easy to get to and from the airport via rapid transit.  ** Also, as someone with asthma and allergies, the fact that Diana has a cat in the main house caused absolutely NO problems for me in the guest apartment.  I had a great stay and would wholeheartedly recommend her to other travelers.  I really do hope that I have the opportunity to stay with her again! Diana is a warm and enthusiastic host. Right off the bat, she gave us recommendations on places to eat (a pho place around the corner, and Root Table), both of which were delicious. The space is perfect for two people, and I think it says a lot that while we loved  being out and about in Seattle, we also really enjoyed spending time in the apartment too. It is clean, comfortable, and comes with a very generous breakfast as well as various thoughtful amenities. There are tons of great restaurants and shops in Ballard within a 15 minute walk, though for farther away neighborhoods, we found that having a car was ideal. All in all, we couldn\\'t have been happier with our stay! We had a wonderful experience with Diana and her rental. Everything was exactly as described, beautiful home and neighborhood, we highly recommended. Diana was very easy to work with, thoroughly prepared and attentive to our needs as guests. A delightful experience overall! Has a lovely stay in Diana\\'s unlawful suite.  \\n\\nDiana\\'s had her own farm fresh eggs in the fridge and provided morning papers at the door each morning.  The in law suite was co y and comfortable in a quiet Ballard neighborhood.  Directions were good.  \\n\\nDiane also recommended places to eat and we tried the favorite Root Table for Appy hour and it was delicious, somewhere we will likely return to.\\n\\nCommunication was excellent and friendly. The only thing I missed was a sitting area to read and chat.  There is a small table with 2 chairs in the kitchen and a comfy chair in the bedroom, so perhaps that is not an issuer for most.  \\n\\nI would certainly recommend Diana\\'s in law suite and really enjoyed exploring Ballard.  Fantastic location, great size of the space, private, clean, perfect.  Would recommend Diana\\'s Air BNB to anyone.  She was wonderful and incredibly helpful. I really don\\'t want to give them a good rating as others may want to stay there and limit our ability to stay again.  We cannot say enough good about our stay at the Brown\\'s house apartment. Fresh eggs, coffee and bread in the fridge when we arrived were an unexpected treat. Its cute, comfortable, and very clean.  Great spot. I had a wonderful experience at Diana\\'s retreat.  I arrived a bit early and was greeted by Diana who showed me the property and suite.  She is a DELIGHT.  They have a wonderful urban garden with raspberries for the picking and sweet cherry trees with fruit ready to pick and enjoy.  The fully stocked kitchen is just perfect for cooking and making breakfast as Diana provided fresh eggs from her chickens, wonderful bread and fancy local jams for toast as well as other fruits and cereals.  The bedroom has an uber-comfortable bed and a nice window with a view of trees and a private yard.  I enjoyed a nap in the comfortable stuffed chair in the bedroom as well as in the well-worn Adirondack chair in the yard just outside the front door.   The property is well located with easy access to major streets and freeways.  I look forward to visiting Diana’s retreat on my next trip to Seattle. Diana was a lovely host.  She kindly picked us up from the airport and supplied us with beautiful fresh cherries during our stay.  The apartment was clean on arrival, the bed was comfortable and it had everything we needed.\\r\\nIt was easy to get the bus to downtown.  We liked Ballard very much and would recommend the Sunday morning market.\\r\\nWould not hesitate to stay here again. We stayed the first week of July.  The apt. was as pictured as advertised and easy to find.  Diana was there to greet us upon arrival.  The unit was very clean.  The refrigerator was stocked with a variety of items.  Almost forgot to mention the fresh eggs.  Chickens in back are quiet.  Cats are very friendly and were a non issue even for my wife and I  with allergies.  Great location only 15min from downtown.  Short walk to the bus. Would definitely stay again. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Our stay at Diana\\'s guest apartment was enjoyable. The apartment was clean with nice touches such as fresh eggs, great bread, coffee, jams, lotion and soaps etc. The apartment has a private entrance with a bedroom, a full kitchen with a cozy table for 2 and a separate bedroom. The yard is a wonderful, private setting to sit and read and receive visits from cute, friendly kitties! Diana has thought of everything and then some. Given the opportunity we would absolutely stay again! Thanks Diana =) Diana\\'s home in Ballard is a lovely oasis with a private entrance for bnbers and a garden full of flowers. Diana has the kitchenette well stocked with breakfast items including super-local eggs (from the backyard chicken coop)! She kindly took us to a grocery nearby for other provisions . . . The bedroom is fine, with everything you might need, as is the bath.  The house is a block or so from the bus stop to central Seattle. We had a great time and strongly recommend Diana\\'s place. Diana\\'s guest apartment is quaint, clean and cozy. The bed is very comfy and she had fresh eggs, fresh bread, yogurt, milk, coffee, half and half, OJ and 4 different flavors of fresh preserves right in the refrigerator so we could start our day off with breakfast every morning!! This saved us money and reduced stress while we vacationed in Seattle! Thanks Diana! \\nNo air conditioner in the apartment but thankfully the nights cooled down so we could open the windows.  Diana was an excellent host. The place was in a great area, very clean and cozy, we almost could have made Diana\\'s lovely backyard our destination. Seattle is a great city, but I\\'m sure it\\'s rare to find such an escape, yet easy to get to spot! The breakfast foods in the fridge were an amazing bonus, and chatting with Diana was one of our highlights. We recommended her place to two friends in the area before we even left town. Definitely a great place to stay!\\r\\n My sister and niece who came from Japan stayed Diana\\'s place. She responded to my inquiry immediately and concerned about their arriving; very thoughtful. They loved not only the cosy clean place, but also Diana\\'s warm welcoming personality. I would recommend the place to my family and friends whenever they come to Seattle. What a wonderful place to stay! We never met Diana, but her husband hosted us and was easy to talk with.  The backyard, kittens, full kitchen and beautiful decor were some of the highlights.  It was so nice to have fresh eggs from their chickens, juice, yogurt, granola, cereal, etc for breakfast options. \\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t recommend staying here if you are exploring Seattle for the first time and don\\'t have a car.  I think the public transportation would eat up your time (we looked into this, and decided to rent a car after all).  \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ll be happy to return! Brown\\'s House was easy to get to and convenient to every place we wanted to go.  Having breakfast there, especially the fresh eggs, was a big plus.  We will always think \\'Browns house\\' when we think of Seattle. PROS: Great little place. Nice and quiet. We enjoyed staying there and Diana was extremely gracious even arranging a ride from the airport and going the extra mile for us. Everything spic and span clean and well organized providing thoughtful amenities. CONS: Ballard is quite a distance riding the D Line bus to downtown Seattle (though downtown Ballard is slightly over a mile walk and very nice). Limited television channels.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Brown\\'s House. It was such a treat to have farm fresh eggs every morning, and the local bread and fresh fruit from their fruit trees was a definite plus. \\r\\n\\r\\nDiana was a fabulous host, and we will definitely be staying here again when we find ourselves in the area!  Diana\\'s home is very charming. Although it\\'s attached to the house we didn\\'t hear that much from the other side of the door other than the occasional piano playing (which I thought was charming). Although the family uses most of the backyard there is a seating area we used in front of our entry, and a side yard next to this little in-law\\'s apartment that affords privacy for egress and some lovely afternoon sun. It was nice to have a full kitchen and we were really overwhelmed by the trouble Diana went to in stocking the fridge - a lovely and convenient touch complete with eggs from her chicken coop! The walk to downtown Ballard was about 25 minutes, so very manageable, and the neighborhood was residential and nice. Quiet except the schoolyard next door (which I also found charming). If you want to be closer to the main part o Ballard, this might not be for you but we were looking for some quite charm - and it fit the bill perfectly!   My husband and I spent a week in Seattle at Diana\\'s guest apartment in Ballard.  We had a great time in Seattle and enjoyed our stay in Diana\\'s apartment.  The area was central to Ballard, Greenwood and an easy bus ride to downtown Seattle.  Apartment was thoughtfully stocked with breakfast food and beverages.  Very clean.  The neighborhood was quiet at night and lovely during the day.  I would highly recommend staying in Diana\\'s apt. for anyone visiting the area.  Bed and pillows comfortable.  Bathroom and shower clean and all in working order.  We used the kitchen every day and found everything we needed supplied; all appliances useful and in working order.  Diana was a kind, thoughtful hostess who was available when we needed her but respected our privacy.  Wonderful apartment and hostess. Diana\\'s guest house was just what I needed for the weekend.  Quiet, clean, comfortable and stocked with cooking equipment and fresh eggs from the backyard chickens.  Diana was so sweet and made sure I knew she was available if I needed anything.  I highly recommend this place. First, let me say that Diana was a wonderful host! She stocks the fridge with eggs fresh from her own chickens, great bread, yogurt, jams, butter, milk, and orange juice. That\\'s only part of the list. We stopped at a local market to pick up some cinnamon for Jim\\'s oatmeal. It didn\\'t seem like something we should expect our host to supply. Diana caught him in line and took care of all the shopping, finding better cinnamon and refusing to let us pay for anything! Her guest apartment is very comfortable for one or two people. One of my favorite views (I even took a picture) is from the comfy chair in the bedroom looking out into the side yard. It\\'s a lovely place, well equipped and tastefully appointed in a wonderful neighborhood. I hope we get to return soon. We really enjoyed our stay. Diana made us feel at home and we appreciated all the good quality breakfast foods and drink that she provided! Diane was an excellent host. I felt completely at home in her guesthouse and really appreciated all the delicious breakfast supplies she left for me. Bed is comfortable and shower has great water pressure. Thanks Diane! See you next time! I stayed at Diana\\'s guest apt with a girl friend when we were in town for a girls weekend.  The apartment was lovely. The bed was very comfortable, and I\\'m often picky with beds. The apartment has a cute kitchen which is well stocked. We were very pleasantly surprised by the amount of food Diana left for us in the fridge. Local coffee, fresh orange juice, fresh eggs from her backyard chickens, toast and yummy jams....it was great! Would definitely stay here again if I am back in the area. Thanks Diana! Wonderful stay in Dianna Dunnells\\' Cozy guest apartment. The property has everything I needed including the best coffee. She was so kind as to provide, milk, juice and bread.  I will go back again and again. The walking location is great. I felt at home, very secure and cozy Diana\\'s an exemplary host: Her e-mail correspondence was always friendly, prompt, and thorough, and she and her husband were both very pleasant when I met them in person the morning after I checked in. \\r\\n\\r\\nBesides being as charming as pictured (or more so, as Diana has updated a bit since the photos), Browns House was clean, exceedingly well stocked—as others have noted, the backyard eggs and other high-quality breakfast goodies are such a treat!— and I almost wish I\\'d been in town a bit longer to grab a few more winks in that cozy bed. \\r\\n\\r\\nI was traveling solo but think the apartment would accommodate a couple quite comfortably, and I\\'d look forward to booking with Diana again the next time we\\'re back up in Seattle. Our stay at Diana\\'s guest house was very pleasant. This was exactly what we needed for our trip - centrally located for our needs, quiet and comfortable. Diana was a wonderful host. The kitchen was stocked with breakfast foods including fresh eggs. I would recommend that friends visiting in the Ballard area consider staying here. Diana is a fantastic and very approachable host, and her family could not have been more welcoming and kind to us. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment was clean, well-appointed and (website hidden) is full of charm, with little features that made it feel truly like a home away from home. Diana provided a very well stocked larder with all essentials and many more high quality goodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe highly recommend Diana\\'s place to anyone staying in the Seattle area, and would happily return there ourselves in a heartbeat. This is a great place to stay in Seattle. Diana leaves fresh fruit, eggs that she\\'s collected from her hens that morning, jams and a choice of cereals. I usually have a place to stay in Ballard, but will recommend this place to friends and family looking for a place that has easy access to Seattle, and plenty to offer within walking distance: some of the best restaurants, a farmers market and a movie theatre. Diana was an amazing host.  Very personable, helpful with recommendations for restaurants as well as knowledge of the surrounding neighborhoods.  I\\'ve already told my friends and family that should they visit Seattle they ought to stay here. Diana is an absolutely awesome host - I wish she was my neighbour!  The guest appartment was comfortable and cozy, and the kitchen well supplied with everthing we needed for breakfast. Enjoyed reading the morning paper with excellent coffee.  Look forward to visiting again soon.  Diana was a friendly host and also a great resource for info about the  Seattle area. Her place was clean and nicely appointed, with a beautiful home and yard. Fresh fruit and eggs from her chickens were a very nice touch that made us feel at home. Diana was a wonderful hostess! She stocked the kitchen with eggs from her own chickens, yogurt, fruit, bread, and jams. I ran into her a couple times and she is so friendly and personable, lending her insights on good neighborhoods in Seattle (we are thinking of moving there). The apartment is very clean and cozy and perfect for our little getaway. It is also in my favorite neighborhood in Seattle, very close to Old Ballard, and within walking distance to some great restaurants (Delancey and The Fat Hen). We definitely enjoyed our stay and would come back again. Diana\\'s cozy apartment is a perfect getaway accommodation for two. Everything you would need for a long weekend trip is provided. A perfectly comfortable bed, a stocked kitchen, and a large bathroom that can be used by more than one person.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can tell that Diana takes pride in providing a comfortable and relaxing space. Fresh eggs, from her chickens, are in the fridge when you arrive.  She provides the paper each morning, and is available for any other need you may need for your comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment is located in my favorite neighborhood in Seattle, and is an easy walk or drive to countless Seattle staples of good food, good libations, and great coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a truly great experience, and will be returning each time we visit Seattle from this point forward. We visited Seattle for our anniversary and this place was in a great and quiet neighborhood, close to many sights and great restaurants. The hosts were very nice. We would recommend this place. Of the many admirable things Diana\\'s unit has to offer, my favorite was the bird watching!  They keep a wild bird feeder stocked in their lovely back yard, and flocks of Seattle-area birds enjoy visiting it.  Then, much to our delight, in the afternoon the chickens were let out.  Is there anything more fun than watching a group of hens diligently hunting in the grass and winter garden?  Totally charming--as was our hostess, who I wish we had had longer to visit with. (Our trip was work-related and we had too many appointments!)\\r\\nThe unit itself is connected to the main house, with several doors that presumably open when guests are not in residence.  The entry used by guests is in the back yard, past the large kitchen windows of the main house, and very easy to find. The apartment\\'s kitchen looks to the back yard and is very functional, with full-sized stove, mini fridge and a small table with two chairs.  The bedroom sits interior of it and is compact, outfitted with very nice linens and an armchair.  We did not use the TV, but admired its placement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe forced air heat source (important in this case as it was well below freezing during our visit) was possible to augment with a space heater as necessary.\\r\\nThis place is a great value, and I\\'d say very suited to guests who like to see their hosts, feel part of the family and connected.  A really lovely setting!  Many thanks for offering it and welcoming strangers into that beautiful garden. A work of art. Diana proved to be an enthusiastic and helpful host. The house was perfect for us and the location was great. See you next time! A small simple apartment with a full kitchen off the back of a big old house with a big backyard. Good quality breakfast supplies. There were chickens in the back of the yard, which was lovely, and which meant that the eggs were marvelously fresh. \\r\\n\\r\\nSound from the house came through, but most of the time people were quiet, and there was no noise during the night either night.\\r\\nThe bed would be fine for one person, but very wobbly for two. My friend and I booked Diana\\'s place for a quick getaway and we were super happy. The suite is really cute and Diana provided everything we needed for a great stay, including breakfast foods, tea/coffee and warm hospitality. The bed is comfortable and the location is great. I hope to get back there soon! Great Value\\r\\nWe stayed here for two nights for a mini-break in Seattle. Cute and cozy. Appreciated the abundant breakfast supplies, including great coffee, cereal, fruit, yogurt, juice, bread and fresh eggs from the chickens in the backyard!  Diana, Bill and their six-toed cats provided a comfortable, clean, quiet sanctuary (indoors and out), took unexpected care to stock the apartment with the items I preferred and were great to chat with. Thanks again! Diana was the perfect host!\\r\\nMy husband and I had a great time while visiting. The Browns House is in a beautiful location, the Guest Apartment is very comfortable, the bed is super!  The refrigerator is  well stocked-the eggs from the garden are just fantastic!\\r\\nWe had a good time, Diana is very friendly and very helpful in all matters.\\r\\nI highly recommend it to anyone!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Diana!   Erika L. Brown\\'s House is a wonderful place to stay... delightfully cozy and welcoming!  My husband and I stayed here for three nights while we were visiting Seattle.  Diana and her husband were the perfect hosts, friendly, helpful, and informative.  They thoughtfully provided all that we needed for delicious gourmet breakfasts each morning, including the freshest and tastiest eggs... produced by their own chickens!  The apartment was charmingly decorated and fully equipped for our stay.  The bed was very comfortable and the windows overlooked an enchanting \"secret garden\".  Our time at Brown\\'s House was a highlight of our visit to Seattle and we would definitely stay here again :) Diana was a very warm and welcoming host.  Everything was as pictured, would definitely stay again! Nice comfortable stay. Enjoyed the fresh eggs for breakfast. We stayed at Browns House for a week and had such a great time. Diana and her family gave us such a warm welcome that we felt like we were visiting old friends. If you have the chance to visit Seattle this is the place to stay. You\\'ll love Browns House and you will love Ballard. We\\'ll definitely return!  Lots of attention to detail with amenities. One of the cleanest airbnb places I\\'ve stayed. Loved the local fresh bread and kitchen set up. Very helpful and friendly host. Didn\\'t get a chance to meet Diana but we were greeted by who we think is her husband.  He was able to show us around inside and pointed out the provisions.  We felt welcomed to ask questions but we honestly didn\\'t need to because we were well accomodated.  We were able to cook breakfast a couple times with what was in the fridge along with some things we went to get at the local market.  Tip: open one of the windows in the kitchen when cooking.  We triggered the smoke alarm cooking hash browns!!  No biggie, we should have known better.  Also good to know that their smoke alarm was in working order.  The bed was really comfy and both my boyfriend and I didn\\'t have any trouble sleeping through the (website hidden) was available for us to watch the World Cup.  The decor was tasteful and not hard on the eyes.  I enjoyed interacting with her 3 cats and adorable chickens.  The neighborhood was really nice and quiet.  I felt safe during my morning jog around the area.  All in all a great experience and would definately stay here again when ever we get a chance to go back. Thanks so much Diana and family!! :-) What a great experience staying at Browns House!  It was a perfect location for us... We were able to travel north of Seattle to visit friends for a day, south to Mt. Rainier and easily around the city of Seattle.  The neighborhood is great - lots of stuff within walking distance.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDiane was a wonderful host - providing a balance of interaction & privacy. The apt was perfect for two of us and we had access to a beautiful backyard. Diane provided fresh eggs from her chickens, coffee, cereal, bread, and other breakfast supplies. The kitchen had plenty of utensils, etc. I would definitely recommend staying here. We has a great time at the Dunnell\\'s.  It was easy access to downtown with the car2go system. The bed was soft and the breakfasts were amazing :)\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks again! This is our second stay as Diana\\'s guests, and we\\'ll continue to come back each time we\\'re in Seattle. The place is clean and cozy, walking distance to our favorite restaurant (Delancey), and just a wonderful neighborhood to be in. Plus, the fresh eggs from Diana\\'s chickens are unbelievably delicious! We totally enjoyed our stay at Browns House Guest Apt in Ballard.  The bedroom, kitchen/dining area, and bathroom were all attractively furnished and had everything we needed.  The bed was very comfortable! The area was very quiet at night. The apartment was light and airy and it was great to walk outside to the nice lawn and gardens and sit in the sun or enjoy a glass of wine at night.  The fresh eggs from the resident chickens were a bonus and a treat.  Diana was very helpful.  Easy to get get around by bus, car or on foot from that location depending on our destination.  We will definitely stay there on our next trip to visit relatives in Seattle. It was a wonderful experience to stay at the Browns\\' House Guest Apartment - the hostess, Diana, was incredibly warm and welcoming, the location was perfect, and everything was extremely well-organized and friendly.  We recommend it heartily, and fully intend to come again.   The Browns House apartment is as perfect and comfortable as it looks in the photos. The decor is soothing and the little kitchenette attached has everything you need (including groceries for breakfast -- bread, fresh eggs, fruit, coffee, or whatever special request you make!). The bathroom is just as nice and fully stocked with sample sizes of toiletries you might have forgotten. Our host did everything she could to make sure we were happy and we were!\\r\\nBe aware that although the apartment has its own separate entrance, it is attached to the hosts\\' house and shares the backyard with the house. If you need near-anonymous levels of privacy, this apartment might not be for you. This was a great location for us in Ballard.  We enjoyed meeting Diana and her family and the apartment was just as described.  We loved sitting the beautiful back yard at the end of the day.  Even better, we enjoyed starting the day with breakfast from the fresh eggs left at our door from the chickens kept out back. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Diana.\\r\\nTim and Cindi The Brown\\'s House guest apartment was even better than shown in the pictures.  Diana made sure that everything was prepared and ready for our arrival.  Her neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe.  Parking and access to the property was easy with good access to places of interest. Diana\\'s place is amazing. I went up to Seattle for a little vacation with my wife and we fell in love with the little apartment. Diana was a great host as well; very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. We would definitely recommend staying here. This is one of the best places I have ever been since I have been traveling to the USA.\\r\\nIt feels like being at home. Perfect place to work, to rest and to contemplate.\\r\\nDiana and her husband are extremely nice, and easy to talk to. It feels so good to find some stuff in the fridge after such a long travel. And I would certainly mostly recommend the chicken\\'s eggs !! \\r\\nThank you again Diana. It has been a real pleasure meeting you. I had a wonderful stay at the Browns House Guest Apartment in Ballard. The accommodations were exactly as described. The kitchen was perfect, complete with a small refrigerator, full stove, sink, and essential cooking materials. An added bonus was the host, Diana, stocking the fridge with FRESH farm eggs from her chickens, milk, orange juice, bread, jam, and butter. It was a such a joy to make breakfast for myself in the morning. The bathroom was a nice size and included plenty of towels and a convenient hair dryer. The bedroom was a true delight. The bed was so comfy and there was a nice TV in the room to watch the new Fall network shows. I am so glad that I stayed in Ballard. I felt very safe and secure, which was important to me since I was traveling alone. Diane is a wonderful host, very kind, thoughtful, and a great communicator.  I would definitely stay here again. I found the setting so idyllic.\\r\\n Dianna was great! Helpful with recommendations and generous with breakfast goodies, including fresh eggs from her resident chickens! The apartment is as described, small but well appointed. Has off street parking, which was great. My only complaint was the small freezer in the fridge was not working at the time. The neighborhood was great and very convenient both to Seattle and our family in Shoreline. Lots of great places to eat in the area & convenient to I-5. Would stay here again and recommend to friends & family. Diana\\'s guest unit was a great place to stay while I was in Seattle for work for a week.  She kindly stocked the unit with bread, milk, fruit and other staples, and even fresh eggs.  My stay was uniformly positive - the unit was perfectly clean, the bed was comfortable, the shower water pressure good, and the neighborhood quiet.  The nearest shopping center (Safeway, Walgreens) is walkable but a little far (0.7 mi) but the express bus to downtown was just about a block away.\\r\\n The Browns House rental was wonderful, truly a pleasure to stay there. The yard is welcoming - the adirondak chairs, the chickens, the trees, the garden - all quite lovely. The cottage was well appointed with everything I needed, right down to the coffee filters and jam and eggs. Diana and Co. are warm and friendly and super hospitable - to the Nth degree. You\\'re in good hands staying here.  We had a great stay at Diana\\'s guest apartment last weekend.  She was kind and easy to communicate with.  She was also helpful in giving us information about the surrounding area and answering any questions we had.  She provided us with a wonderful breakfast every day.  The neighborhood is safe and the apartment is cozy.  We would love to go back some time! We really enjoyed our stay at Brown House.  Diana was very accommodating.  It is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood.  We would stay there again. We were welcomed as usual with a well-stocked refrigerator and pantry, and really appreciate the chance to prepare the breakfast we want when we want it. A good closet and chest of drawers allowed us to settle in comfortably. The location away from the street and with Diana\\'s wonderful backyard with cats and chickens wandering about completed the very good picture.\\r\\n Diana\\'s place was very comfortable and a warm place to spend our evenings while visiting in Seattle.  the fresh eggs and breads for breakfast were a big plus.  her place was conviently located to restaurants, bakeries, coffee houses and public transportation to  downtown Seattle.  We have already recommended it to other family members for their visits to the Seattle area. The house is exactly as advertised -- impecable! We loved the place! The location is incredible, close to everything we wanted to see and do. The place was clean and perfect. We had no problems finding the house and Diana was extremely kind and attentive to us! Diana made us feel quite at home.  \\r\\nThe evening we arrived she checked to see what provisions that\\r\\nshe should get for our breakfast.  Of course, she had her own fresh eggs, which were delicious.  The place is very roomy with a full kitchen and bath.  We definitely would stay again. This was great space to stay while in Seattle.  Ballard is an awesome neighborhood and the apartment was very private, the full kitchen was well stocked (eggs, milk, juice, yogurt, cereal, coffee) and everything was clean and comfortable.  We would definitely stay again!  Diana is extremely responsive, friendly, and made us feel welcome.   Diana\\'s place was amazing. The apartment is spacious yet cozy. The kitchen was stocked with food and Diana was very helpful and friendly. Wonderful experience all around. Quiet, clean, and peaceful little nook in a great location in relation to downtown Ballard. I am a light sleeper and I slept like a rock. Diana was kind, accommodating, and welcoming, and the space looked just as lovely as it does in the pictures. It felt like every little detail had been considered, and Diana had even stocked the space with all sorts of lovely breakfast staples, fresh coffee, and eggs from her chickens. I would stay with Diana again in a heartbeat. :)  Diana\\'s House Guest Apartment was exactly as described and pictured. It was very comfortable and served as a good jumping off point to explore Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo points I really enjoyed about my stay:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Diana and her family are very nice folk, very easy going and great to chat with. Diana herself really went out of her way to make me feel comfortable and I enjoyed chatting with her about traveling and the city. One of the nicest hosts I\\'ve stayed with!\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Amenities provided are numerous and of good quality. Diana goes beyond basic amenities and provides you a variety of groceries and bathroom supplies. All were very useful!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is very close to a bus line which is a direct route to downtown Seattle. It still takes around 20-30 minutes via bus to get into downtown but getting to the bus stop itself is quite easy by walking. There\\'s a big supermarket (Safeways) around 10 blocks away which is also easily reachable via a good walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinitely enjoyed my stay at Diana\\'s and i heartily recommend staying with her! Diana was a wonderful hostess! She thinks of everything you need, is very generous, kind, and attentive. Highly recommend!  I loved staying at the browns guest house.  This is great value and wonderful location.  I am already planning another stay.  Diana and Bill are kind and generous host and I enjoy chatting with Diana.  I felt safe which is important since I am traveling alone.  All the extras such as the fresh eggs which are delish and bread, yogurt, juice, milk, cereals and coffee and so much more.  The kitchen is so wonderful..  Full kitchen. You will not be disappointed. I felt so comfortable didn\\'t want to leave.  I only use public transportation and the bus is cheap and runs often no need for a rental car at the browns.  The bed and sheets awesome.  Best airbnb experience. See you again real soon .   This was my first airbnb.  I thought it was all couch surfing and I\\'m glad I was wrong.  Diana\\'s place was perfect for me.  It was quiet and just the right amount of space.  I was greeted with fresh food, milk, bread, fruit, etc.  She was very helpful recommending restaurants and would stay again. En la casa de Diana nos sentimos muy a gusto, realmente comodos.- El departamento es justo como se lo describe en el anuncio, totalmente preparado para dos personas, no mas.- El dpto está en la afueras de Saettle, pero a unos diez minutos del centro de Seattle, muy accesible.- El Barrio donde está el dpto es muy pintoresco y tranquilo, con mercados cerca para poder hacer las compras basicas para la residencia.-  Diana is a true professional and made me feel so welcome. From the fresh chicken eggs, spring bouquet to the great bread from the bakery down the street. I was a busy worker gone a lot and next time I just want to stay around to help in the garden. Its is a quiet, comfortable, quaint place, that left me wanting more. The apartment was just like in the pictures. It is on a very lovely and quiet neighborhood. Diana knows what a tired traveller needs and made us feel like home. We slept so well and enjoyed the good breakfast. If you want some peace and quiet on your trip, this is the perfect spot.  In a nutshell...Diana and the Browns House Guest Apartment are everything we hoped it would be.  Fresh eggs, beautiful backyard, and proximity to everything Seattle has to offer, serves only to enhance the experience.  The apartment was cozy and clean, with fresh flowers and a variety of wonderful breakfast foods.  If you haven\\'t made your reservation yet...do so.  Your Seattle experience will be all the richer when you do.  \\r\\n Diana is a gracious hostess, and enjoys having guests. The in-law apartment is quite comfortable, and the neighborhood is very charming. Close to busses that go downtown. It was a lovely place in a nice quite neighbourhood. Diane and her husband were so kind and welcoming and helpful. The place was perfect, the bed was realy nice and the fridge was full. The yard was an extra treat, wonderful to sit in after a long day in Seattle with a friendly cat joining us and the chickens in the background. Also, good wifi. All and all a great experience.  My aunt stayed here and had a lovely stay. She mostly enjoyed the quiet meditative space it provided.  This was a prefect place to come \"home\" to at the end of long sight-seeing days.  Diana and Bill are gracious hosts, providing more goodies and tips than we expected -- fresh eggs every morning, bakery fresh bread and fruit. Hanging out in the garden under the fruit trees and flowers was a peaceful end to busy days.  Had a great time in Seattle. The home was an oasis in between two busy conferences. Diana was great with ideas of places to eat and things to do.  Highly recommend Dale Chihuly\\'s glass and garden museum. Had a lovely meal at the Skillet. Bed was comfortable and breakfast items were a thoughtful touch. Was able to relax in the garden listening to the happy sounds of the school children on their recess.  Went to Pike Place and the tower, spent a relaxing afternoon at Green Lake.  Will totally recommend this place to others and it will be our first choice should we return to Seattle.  Host made us feel extremely comfortable.  The neighborhood was very nice.    Diana welcomed us as we pulled into the driveway and carefully showed us around her lovely little apartment. Everything was cozy and very comfortable. It\\'s part of her big lovely old home in a beautiful, tree-lined neighborhood, quiet yet close to the routes we needed to take to get downtown and see the sights. We loved having a big back yard just outside the door, and Diana left fresh eggs from her own hens, a loaf of delicious honey wheat bread, plus fruit and coffee: we never had to buy breakfast! Highly recommend this little gem in Seattle! (And don\\'t miss the Chihuly Glass Museum!!) Diana is an amazing host.  So very kind and helpful.  Thanks for the tip on Equal Exchange coffe. My husband and I are truly enjoying our cappacinos on our ride to Astoria! We loved the place. It was really nice to meet Diana. She was really friendly and helpful. Everything was excellent. The bus downtown was in easy walking distance. The hummingbirds in the garden were amazing. It was so nice to relax when we got home and to enjoy the garden, and the peace and quiet. Would definitely come again :)  Diana was a great host. Very friendly. Provided us w/ fresh eggs,great coffee,fruit,yogurt, milk, orange juice and delicious bread on arrival. Nice outdoor area to wind down w/ a glass of wine after a busy day. The apt. is very small but cosy. The neighborhood is great. Good restaurants near by. We loved the salmon bisque and live music at Hatties Hat. Nice view of sunset at Sunset Hill Park. There was a heat wave in Seattle when we arrived and Diana provided us w/ a nice air conditioner to keep our room cool and comfortable during the night.\\r\\n My husband and I had a wonderful stay in Seattle at Browns House!  Diana was a very accommodating host with a lovely guest apartment.  The kitchen was stocked with fresh eggs, bread, yogurt, etc. that made us feel right at home.  She was also very helpful with recommending places to eat and things to do in the city.  Ballard was a really cool neighborhood and convenient to stay in.  I highly recommend staying here while visiting Seattle! Everything was wonderful. Diana stocked the fridge with half-n-half for the coffee kept in the cupboard, fresh brown and blue eggs from her chickens housed on the back of the property, bread, cereal, and orange juice, which was great since we didn\\'t have time to shop for supplies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was great, the bathroom had every amenity you\\'d find in your own home and the view of the apple and pear trees from the kitchen table were refreshing to see.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was easy to find, convenient and simply marvelous. What a wonderful stay! Great host, great space. Kitchen stocked with everything you\\'d ever need to cook, including some essentials like eggs, milk, coffee, etc. The perfect way to really make a trip truly special. Highly recommended.  We greatly enjoyed our stay in Diana\\'s guest apartment.  She greeted us on arrival and showed us the amenities.  The space included a private bath, small kitchen with breakfast table, small bedroom with lounge chair and plenty of closet space.  Diana stocked the refrigerator with fresh eggs from her chickens, local bread and coffee, jams, butter, fresh fruit, juice and creamer.  We had a delicious breakfast before we headed out to explore Seattle.  \\r\\nThe house was located in a nice Ballard neighborhood close to two bus lines.  We left our car parked in Diana\\'s driveway and took the bus into different Seattle neighborhoods to tour the city on foot.\\r\\nWe felt comfortable sitting in Diana\\'s back yard on the Adirondack chairs just outside our entry door.  She even left the Seattle Times on our doorstep each morning.\\r\\nDiana was very personable and made helpful suggestions regarding the city and bus system.  We would definitely return to Diana\\'s guest house on future trips to Seattle. We had a wonderful stay at Diana\\'s guest house last week in Seattle. Diana made us feel very welcomed. Breakfast was given during our stay including fresh eggs in the mornings. We felt very comfortable and if we needed anything, it was taken care of. Thank you! Clean, quite and comfortable. Very nice extra touches like a bowl of organic fruit, eggs from the chickens in the yard, local bead and coffee all add to a pleasant stay.  Since I don\\'t have a spare bedroom (in my Seattle apartment), my parents stayed at Diana\\'s Browns House in Ballard while they were visiting me. It worked out perfectly! They so enjoyed staying there and my mom wrote up this feedback for Diana: \"We are so glad that our daughter found your lovely home. We so enjoyed coming back to your cozy house and our comfy room! Thank you for the fruit and refrigerator items! Coffee was much appreciated too! We hope to come back again in the future!\"  El apartamento es tal y como se describe en el anuncio: muy acogedor, limpio y tranquilo. El marido de Diana, Bill, muy amablemente nos proporcionó productos frescos y naturales que hicieron nuestras delicias en el desayuno. Disfrutamos mucho nuestra estancia en el jardín/pequeña granja. Es un sitio ideal para descansar después de un ajetreado día de visita a la ciudad y sus alrededores. El barrio también es muy bonito, tranquilo pero perfectamente conectado por bus con el centro y con restaurantes y tiendas cercanas. Lo mejor que podemos decir es que la estancia fue muy agradable y que nos sentimos como en casa. Repetiremos si volvemos a Seattle. Our stay at the chalet was a kind we will never forget. Despite the lack of power and a lot of rain we did not regret our stay for one moment.\\nTami is a great host snd did all possible to accomodate us. The chalet is well equiped, spacious and the use of hottub and pool is an extra.\\nAnd of top of this all there is a garden full od veggiex and fruits available to the guests. We tried them all and to be honest never tasted fruit better than this. Diana was helpful and responsive. The location was in good proximity to the old Ballard neighborhood\\'s shops and eateries.  The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was amply equipped. We appreciated the off-street parking. Good value, safe area. Nice city! \\r\\n The Brown\\'s home was  in a great location-Ballard is awesome and such a close drive to Seattle!  As stated, the home is older but has all the necessities-nice bed, tv, kitchen, bathroom, etc.  Dianna and her family were very accommodating for us and we enjoyed our time. Diana was very helpful and a gracious host. When we got there, she greeted us and gave us several tips on different restaurants in the Ballard area. The location is about 15 minutes outside of Downtown Seattle, so commutes were super quick and easy. Will definitely repeat the stay if we end up in the area again. the window was cracked and the sash cord broken.  However fine apart from that. An excellent stay! The place is full of charm and was great for our stay in Seattle. The breakfast food was very much appreciative and delicious.  Diana is very welcome and helpful. We love Ballard area. It\\'s very quiet and nice area. Diana house is very beautiful and clean. She offers us organic eggs from the yard. It\\'s the best eggs i ever had. The yolk is orange color. It\\'s so organic and chicken should be very health. I will definitely recommend to other travelers.   Our review is like all the others - Diana\\'s guest house was just perfect. Everything was exactly as shown. She was as kind as everyone described. We were lucky enough to enjoy the delicious eggs from her chickens and all the other goodies she stocked the fridge with for us. She responded to all texts immediately and was simply a great host. We loved the little apartment. It was perfect for the two of us and our little one year old daughter (the Pack N Play fit perfectly). We would definitely stay here again and hope to do so in the near future.  Brown\\'s House was exactly what I was hoping for and expecting...a beautiful, charming home-away-from-home that was cozy to snuggle in on a rainy morning, but spacious enough to stretch out in. The cottage looks just as it does in the photos, it was spotless and well stocked with toiletries, bread, coffee, eggs and fruit, and the bed was very comfortable. We never got to meet Diana but found that from the first moment I contacted her to the day we checked out she was prompt and friendly in her communication. (Her sweet kitty acted as a delightful ambassador, greeting us in the garden upon arrival). Check in and check out were both easy and hassle-free. The surrounding neighborhoods of downtown Ballard and Phinny Ridge were both charming destinations in of themselves, and the cottage was ideally located for day-trips to Bellingham, Snoqualamie and Bainbridge Island, as well as an easy in & out of downtown Seattle.  We take a short trip to the Seattle area annually, this was the first time we stayed in an Airbnb and I would not hesitate a moment to stay in the Browns house again next year.  Staying here at Browns House was my first experience with Air BNB, and so I wasn\\'t sure what to expect, but it was a wonderful experience.  I\\'m not sure if all AirBNB locations are like Browns House, but Diana (the hostess) definitely set the bar super high!\\r\\n\\r\\nDiana was extremely welcoming and thoughtful.  Every morning, she laid out the newspaper at the door.  Also, she gave us fresh bread, great coffee, and eggs from her own chickens.  They were delicious!  In addition, she gave us her cell phone number, and we could call or text her with any requests we had, whether it was for more eggs or if we asked for dining suggestions.  She was very helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrowns House included the bedroom, a full kitchen, and a full bathroom.  It was comfortable, clean, and private, and it was a very relaxing time to be able to sleep in, then make a healthy breakfast, sip some top-notch coffee, and read the paper.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location was easy to find, and there was off-street parking in the driveway.  Additionally, the location was fantastic in that it was easy to get to downtown Seattle (about a 15 minute drive), but it was far enough away that traffic and noise were minimal.  Also, there were plenty of fantastic restaurants and shops in the Ballard area (I definitely recommend the Hot Cakes Cakery and the Skillet Diner, both of which are about a 5 minute drive away).  Also in the area are a Whole Foods, Trader Joe\\'s, and other markets if you want to save some money and eat in.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiana and Browns House made our trip to Seattle perfect.  I would definitely stay there again! The house is at a very favourable place with good connection to the downtown. It\\'s clean, the bed is very convenient. Diana was very helpful and kind. She even left us eggs, bread, butter, orange juice, etc. In the fridge. And the bonus: when we left, she drove us to the airport to pick up our rental car which was a great thing. Thank you Diana! Our stay in Ballard was great! Diana was very sweet, and provided us breakfast each morning. Fresh chicken eggs, milk, toast, and jam. The guest house was also lovely. Diana is an amazing host! She really goes above and beyond in making her guests feel comfortable. The space is wonderful, perfectly cozy and private, with a very comfortable bed, and the kitchen is stocked with fresh eggs from her chickens and other delicious breakfast items -- such a nice thing to provide for us. The location in Ballard is great, quiet street but a short walk to the neighborhood\\'s bars and restaurants, and a bus or cab ride into the city proper. Can\\'t say enough good things about our stay! This guest apartment at the back of the house in a nice Ballard neighborhood is easy to get to, comfortable, and was furnished with everything we needed: a comfortable bed, cozy furnishings, roomy bathroom with shower and a kitchen with all the appliances one could possibly need.  Diana was a very attentive and friendly host, but we still had plenty of privacy.  We were delighted with the fresh eggs and bread for breakfast.  The apartment steps out into her beautiful backyard with old fruit trees.  This was the perfect base for our Ballard centered trip, but it was also easy enough to get in to Seattle or out to Woodinville for some great wine tasting.   Wonderful, welcoming experience. Cozy and convenient. Thank you Diana for a great visit. We loved your place!  We had a great time at the Brown\\'s House. Its located in a quiet part of Ballard, and close to a major bus line that heads through downtown. The unit sits in the back of the house facing the backyard with a small garden and some chickens. Amenities are as described, and we found the space to be comfortable and peaceful. Diana was accommodating throughout our trip, providing breakfast items, including eggs from her chickens, and checking in to answer any questions we had about the city. Overall, the process was easy and really contributed to a great trip.   Excellent home and host. It was a perfect stay in Seattle. Convenient location and quiet neighborhood.  I loved this Airbnb!  The decor was great, the neighborhood was cute, and Shannon was spot on with her suggestions around the neighborhood.  If I really lived in Washington, I would love to live in a place like this Ballard house.  The neighborhood is quiet and great for people who want a relaxing stay.  I can\\'t forget to mention that her King size bed is the most comfortable bed I\\'ve ever slept on! Also, make sure to walk over to The Fat Hen, Honore, and Delancy if you want some yummy places to eat at within walking distance!  Perfectly perfect. Will stay here again.  We had a wonderful time in Shannon\\'s comfortable vintage home for a trip to Seattle for my father\\'s 80th birthday. Shannon is a great communicator and quick responder. She allowed us to bring our own small microwave (not otherwise available)--and when we were dummies and tripped a circuit by running the microwave and the hot water kettle at the same time, she came right over to access the switch box (behind a locked door). We were lucky she was in town and staying nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is *wonderful*, the location is fantastic, and Shannon is an extraordinarily thoughtful host. If you want a TV (we didn\\'t!) there isn\\'t one. But you\\'ll have a marvelously comfortable bed in a quiet neighborhood, high-quality linens, a real home to stay in, complete with full-size closet in addition to a wardrobe and dresser, and a really wonderful back yard. It\\'s so great to have a real kitchen as well, plus the dining room and living room. So cozy! Street parking is easy. You do have to be able to go up steps into the house (again, no problem for us). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! We had a great trip to Seattle to visit our family and Shannon\\'s home was located in a convenient location, and nice neighborhood. No need for a car.\\r\\nShannon was a good host, offering to launder towels and bedding during our almost three week stay, although it wasn\\'t necessary as she stocked ample towels and a change of sheets in the house.\\r\\nShe provided a very comfortable king size bed and a clean house for us. We appreciated the few supplies in the kitchen to hold us over until we could shop for groceries.\\r\\nIt is a cozy, clean, and quiet place to stay. It was a pleasure to stay at Shannon\\'s home, which was clean, very comfortable and so nicely decorated.  We would definitely want to return when we visit Seattle again. We had a wonderful stay in this charming home.  Most importantly, the home and bed are very comfortable, clean, quiet, well equipped and perfectly located for our needs. The added benefits were it\\'s charming decorative details that made us feel as though we had a home away from home. We loved our stay!  We had a great time staying in Shannon\\'s home. The place was exactly as it appears in the pictures and the listing and she was an incredibly accommodating host before, during and even after our stay (helping return something that was erroneously delivered while we were there). Considering that our stay occurred during the holidays, it was even more impressive that she was so attentive. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe were able to easily and affordably use Car2Go or UberX to everywhere that we couldn\\'t walk to (which wasn\\'t much). The water pressure in the shower was great (this is huge for me) and the bed was incredibly comfortable and I really can\\'t stress this enough. We were literally taking pictures of the tags on the mattress and pillows so we could order them later ourself. There were ample clean linens for the 5 days that we stayed and the home has Nest heating so there is no issue trying to figure out how to turn on the heat. The backyard looked nice though it was really too cold for us to spend much time out there. \\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, the home also has a cool style about it and doesn\\'t feel like some stodgy rental property.  Shannon\\'s home is like a lovely little time capsule, and only a few blocks from some great restaurants/bakeries.  I had a great stay. We had an unbelievable experience at Shannon\\'s well styled and comfortable home. The location was just what we were looking for, close-in to the sites of Seattle, walkable to all of Ballard, and yet quiet and out of the way enough to relax. We highly recommend this for a romantic weekend away. There were plenty of amenities to provide more than you need, but the house is blissfully free of distraction. We\\'d come back for sure.   Shannons place is both a little bit of a time travel as well as very much enjoyable. The house is decorated with love and Shannon was welcoming, friendly and helpful. The neighborhood is just great, quiet while at the same time close to smaller shops and easy t go to Seattle downtown.\\nHighly recommended! Lovely little home with every extra comfort included.  Shannon really goes the extra mile.  Huge comfortable bed made for relaxing. Home is only minutes from DT.  Beautiful large backyard as well. Super cozy home, very friendly hostess, and a wonderful location…really couldn\\'t have asked for more.  Also thoroughly enjoyed the fabulous record collection and lounging in the palatial backyard!  Shannon was an incredibly thoughtful hostess from start to finish, and I would book here again in a heartbeat.  I had a truly lovely stay in this charming 1940 Ballard house!    Shannon was an amazing host and her apartment is a dream. She was extremely open and thorough in her communication leading up to the booking and provided very easy & clear check in instructions. The apartment itself is in a gorgeous, quiet neighborhood with a beautiful, relaxing garden out back. I would definitely stay here again. Shannon was very communicative and quick in response to questions, so A+ on the host front.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, the place. This place is Amazing. There\\'s an impressive attention to detail in the amenities (otter pops in the freezer, very well-stocked kitchen), delightful decor (awesome vintage everywhere, a record player!), and the little welcoming touches (like candies & truffles on the front side table).\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat stay. Great location. Great place. Highly recommend this for making your trip to Seattle even more of a treat. Shannon was great and so helpful. She made it easy for me to get in and her place is incredible! So beautiful, cozy and clean. The backyard was big and great as well! The neighborhood is perfect and there are lots of awesome restaurants and things to do nearby. I would definitely stay here again! Shannon was easy to contact and very helpful. She promptly responded to any queries we had. Her place is charming and we enjoyed our stay We loved the home. The street was easy to find parking on, right in front or near the home. Shannon was there to great us. I always like to meet the owner as it gives a personal touch rather than receiving a cold note. It started to get cool at night and the furnace quickly heated up the home. No worries here.  The location is close enough to walk to some very good breakfast and bakery spots. Meaning very safe neighborhood. Also an Uber ride to downtown Ballard is only $5-8. Downtown Ballard has a ton of great restaurants, breweries, and bars. Shannon does a great job explaining everything in person and also her house manual. The bed was comfortable, especially for this 6\\'7\" person. Plenty of closet and drawer space. Nice bathroom. The vintage furnishings and decorations are gorgeous. I would highly recommend staying here and will do so the next time we visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor our touristy activities, (Pikes Place, Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens, MOHAI museum) might I recommend driving and parking in the pay lot near MOHAI,  then Uber or walk everywhere else. The \"catch\" is that you will have to go and visit MOHAI museum, which is a rather good history museum (easily spend hours there), and they validate your ticket, making your parked car only cost $5 for the entire day. Remember, you have to visit the museum for this to work. Do it on a Thursday and its even a better deal as the museum stays open until 8pm. Staying at Shannon\\'s place was perfect for extended stay work trip. The house had all the comforts and conveniences with added touches like the turntable for playing records. Her interior design chops did not go unnoticed either. Very pleasant stay. Thanks Shannon! Kevin and Pepe were great hosts. They were very communicative and open to when we had an extra unexpected person. The house is really cute, my mom even wanted to steal the design of the desk in the spare bedroom. It\\'s really close to everything and it was very easy to find parking. Would definitely book this again when I go back up to Seattle.  Adorable home with a beautiful usable patio and garden! We did not meet our host, Kevin, but the check in was easy (instructions were given via text message) and enough instructions were left in the house for easy check out as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe home was exactly what was advertised. One master bedroom with a full/queen size bed and a smaller room with a twin, perfect for our situation (a couple and a single dude). The master bedroom has access to the backyard patio area, which looked very well taken care of with lots of flowers and plants. There was a nice grill outside that we didn\\'t take advantage of, but can definitely see ourselves using if we had stayed longer.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe home is walking distance (10-20 mins in a nice neighborhood) from the Ballard Locks and Old Ballard, which has lots of restaurants and shops. I recommend Blue Bird Creamery, which is about a 10-15 min walk to the East, and any of its ice cream in a waffle cone. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a great time, thank you! I was warmly and prompted greeted by the host\\'s friend and given a tour of the house. The picture does not do justice to how beautiful the flowers are. The backyard has a great sitting area with table and chairs to enjoy the fresh air. The kitchen is stocked with everything you could possibly need and then some. I enjoyed the comfortable master bed. The house has another bedroom, too. There is a full washer and dryer if needed. The shower has great water pressure. The house is in Ballard convenient to multiple sight seeings attractions and has off the road parking, a perk in Seattle. I even walked to Trader Joe\\'s while here. I would gladly stay here again. Thanks for a great experience.  We had a lovely time at Kevin\\'s house. It was exactly as presented on the Airbnb photo\\'s. We especially enjoyed the backyard as the weather was so beatiful at the time of our stay and we were able to use Kevin\\'s barbecue. \\r\\nThe rest of the house is well furnished (especially the kitchen) and was even decorated with fresh flowers. \\r\\nThe neighbourhood was quiet and nice. We won\\'t hesitate to come back to Kevin\\'s place if we come back to Seattle. The place was quaint and beautiful. Kevin was very helpful and accommodating to our needs in terms of schedule and allowed us to check in earlier than said time. His partner Pepe was very sweet and had an amazing deck and garden. The place was perfect for what we needed. Also, the \"fat hen\" is an amazing brunch spot within walking distance from the place. All in all, the experience from the booking to the end was stellar. Kevin communicated well and attended to all our needs and questions. Thank you Kevin and Pepe for lending us your space. We all had a blast in Ballard.  Our family came to Seattle to go to our daughter\\'s wedding.  This house was comfortable and very nice to stay in.  The garden is beautiful in the back yard.  The bus stop to downtown and a few restuarants and  a convience mart are all within walking distance.  It was a pleasure to stay here and the host was very nice.  The house was spotlessly clean and the neighborhood was quiet and nice. Thank you.\\r\\n       The cottate was very comfortable, and much larger than it appears from the picture.  There are two separate bedrooms, and a nice kitchen and living room.  the flower gardens were lovely and peaceful for relaxing in the early mnorning pr evening.  There were lots of unexpected extras in the refrigerator and cupboard that made our stay even better. We had the most wonderful stay! The garden was more beautiful than we could ever have imagined, my children had room to run and we had a lovely place to sit and enjoy the weather. The house reminded me of my grandparents house, in the best way. Worn-in, comfortable, unpretentious and exactly what we needed. Location was excellent, walkable to Ballard and supermarkets and playgrounds and the public pool. Quiet neighborhood and friendly neighbors. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Wir sind dankbar, dass wir eine wunderschöne Ferienwoche in Kevins schönem, gepflegtem und vollständig ausgestatteten Haus in sehr ruhiger und sicherer Umgebung verbringen durften. Bei dem für Seattle ungewöhnlich heißem Wetter haben wir besonders den Aufenthalt  in dem gepflegten Garten inmitten der vielen wunderschön blühenden Blumen genossen. Für Besichtigungen ist die Innenstadt gut und schnell mit dem Schnellbus zu erreichen. Wir haben eine rundum schöne Woche in sehr angenehmer Umgebung verbracht. Danke Kevin, jederzeit wieder. We could not have asked for a better location to meet our needs.  It was perfect for us.  Pepe greeted us and did the walk through.   The house is well stocked with everything one could need.  The best part was the deck with grill and beautiful flowers.  We spent a considerable amount of time on the deck, visiting with friends.  I just wish we could have stayed longer.  Thank you for everything.   We really enjoyed staying at Kevin and Pepe\\'s lovely home! The check-in process was smooth and the info Kevin provided before arrival and Pepe provided after arrival was very helpful. The home was absolutely spotless and very comfortable with everything we needed. The gardens are incredible and a very relaxing place to sit and enjoy. The location was perfect, as well. Thanks for being excellent hosts! We look forward to staying again next time we\\'re in Seattle.  plenty of positives with this listing. great, friendly hosts, so nice to deal with and very accommodating. nice private location, quiet, even at night. easy walking distance to ballard market grocery store, honore (for some fantastic authentic croissants, just around the corner), the fat hen for a yummy breakfast (get there early). even walking down to the ballard farmers market on Sunday was an easy walk.  house is very clean, spacious for 2 or more. all kitchen and cleaning supplies available. no need to bring laundry or dish detergent, or toilet tissue. plenty of kitchen and bedroom linens, and great working washing machine and dryer. plenty of kitchen dishes, pots and pans.  food in frig, leftover from previous guests can be handy, especially if they leave icrecream and butter !  back deck extremely enjoyable with lovely potted flowers and flower garden and bird feeder (we enjoyed seeing and hearing the birds every morning).  we had family visiting us, and we (there were 9 of us) all sat  comfortably on the deck. the kitchen had paper plates and napkins, which was so handy because we had pizza.  this is a very bright lovely sunny home, nice living room with sofa and armchairs and tv.  eat in kitchen for 3, toaster, microwave and coffee maker all within easy reach. next time I\\'m in Seattle I know where i\\'m staying!  thanks, Kevin and Pepe we had a great time ! All contacts with Kevin were great. He was responsive and very helpful. The listing was very much as described with a beautiful garden. My parents loved staying there and enjoyed the neighborhood with the small shops & restaurants nearly.  Kevin & Pepe were very pleasant & easy to work with.  They responded quickly to our questions.  While not fancy, the bungalow was clean & comfortable with all the essentials.  We would stay there again. House was pretty much as described. Lovely little neighborhood with cafes close by. Was there for a wedding so really didn\\'t spend much time at the house. Clean, well supplied and easy access to everything we needed.  Der Bungalow von Kevin bietet alle Annehmlichkeiten die man benötigt und entsprach genau der Beschreibung. Wir haben zu Dritt darin vier Nächte darin verbracht und uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Unterkunft verfügt neben 2 Schlafzimmern, Bad und Wohnzimmer über eine voll ausgestattete Küche die benutzt werden kann - das ist sehr praktisch! Der Garten ist sehr hübsch und gepflegt und die Nachbarschaft sehr ruhig. Es gibt mehrere Bäckereien und (Frühstücks-)Restaurants die man unbedingt besuchen sollte. Für manche mag die Entfernung zum Stadtzentrum von Seattle etwas  zu sein (etwa 20 min Fahrtzeit bis zum Seattle Center). Dies stellte für uns aber kein Problem da. Von der Haupstrasse aus fahren regelmässig Busse in das Zentrum und andere Stadteile. Unser Gesamterlebnis war grossartig. Kevin is a very responsive host.  Every time we emailed a question, he responded quickly, and he was gracious in removing the down bedding ahead of time that would not work with our allergies.  He met us when we checked in and went through the house with us which we appreciated.  All of the essential amenities were there waiting for us. The garden off of the master bedroom is beautiful and peaceful.  The location is great as advertised, and the price is reasonable. The house is older, and we found that the bathroom isn\\'t as well suited for tall people (we are 6\\'5\" and 5\\'9\") as it would be for shorter people. Also the wifi is very slow and didn\\'t allow us to stream information and movies on our iPads; it would work well for about a minute and then the spinning wheel would appear for about 1 -2 minutes and then the whole process would repeat. If you need to do work during your stay, we\\'d recommend finding a nearby cafe with dependable wifi.   The bungalow was perfect for our needs. We walked to the zoo and restaurants.  Very comfortable and backyard flowers/deck a bonus. This property was a perfect stay. Great location, well equipped, great safe  neighborhood with off street parking, and plenty of space to relax and spend time with family. The hosts were available but never needed as everything was so organized. It was very clean and seamless to use. A great property, in a great location. Kevin and Pepe arrived just as we pulled up in a taxi.  They were very welcoming.  The place was exactly as I expected and was very comfortable.   I\\'m hoping to visit again and stay at the bungalow.  The neighborhood is lovely. Kevin responded to my request immediately and was very accommodating. Everything went smoothly, so there was no need to contact him but I felt confident that he would be right there as needed. The bungalow is a sweet little grandma cottage - simple yet comfortable, with everything that we needed (bed linens, pillows, blankets, towels, kitchen tools, etc). If you go during a Seattle fall or winter, be sure to bring slippers or cozy socks! The floors can be cold. This is a nice little house in a great neighborhood.  All communications with the owners were clear and great.  We felt welcomed and very happy to be there.  The beds were comfortable and the garden was really nice. Kevin and Pepe were very easy to communicate and plan with for exchanging keys and the set-up beforehand. The house was very cute and cozy, and very easy from a guest stand point (what to do with sheets, recycling, leaving the keys, etc.).  Kevin is a fantastic host. I would highly recommend this listing. The location is in the most convenient place, everything was as described. High praise to Kevin!  The loft was very spacious and comfortable and Valerie provided all the necessary ammenities including toiletries, towels, and linens. It was a beautiful place and not to far from the city. Just about 15 minutes from Seattle. Overall a great stay for our night there. This studio was clean, classy and comfortable. We had everything we needed to make our stay in Seattle perfect. It was very easy to get into downtown Seattle by going south on 15th Avenue. All in all, it was a great experience! Our plans changed so I cancelled this reservation, but Valeria is really communicative. The listing was very accurate, just as pictured. Valerie was a great host. Our check in and checkout times didn\\'t quite match up but Valerie was very accommodating and left us with access instructions. We had plenty of parking and great access to the bus to get downtown.  Overall the stay was great! There wasn\\'t much of a description about the appliances that were available so we had to run to the store to grab coolers. Valarie was easy to contact and she responded in an appropriate time with answers.  Valerie was very accomodative to our last minute plans to extend our vacation a few extra days in Seattle. Nice place, glad we were able to stay there! The loft was charming and clean. We were out and about and didn\\'t spend a lot of time there, but it was very comfortable. We would be happy to stay there again. Very easy location. It was clean. Loved the bathroom. My only critic is that 15th is a pretty busy street so it can get loud but it wasn\\'t that bad.    Valerie was super accommodating even though we made a request literally at 5pm the same day we wished to stay. She hit me back within a few minutes and we were ready to check in within the hour. Had a great time. Loved the location. My colleagues and I came into town for business and stayed at Valerie\\'s condo. It was great. Extremely convenient, parking right outside the front door on the street, and she was available at anytime for questions. One thing to note, and it was not a negative for us because we weren\\'t there very often, but she does not have a true kitchen in the unit. She has a small fridge, coffee machine, toaster oven, and few accessories, but that\\'s it. The sink is in the bathroom.\\n\\nAgain, we loved the spot. But if you\\'re looking for a kitchen in the unit, it might not be quite right for you.\\n\\nI would gladly stay with Valerie again! Had limited contact with host.  She left the door open for us and the key on a table .  We had our own entry in to the studio.  Loved the coffee pot and coffee left for us by the host.  The space was big enough for two people.  A light by the bed would be helpful.  The water pressure in the shower was low, and no instructions on what to do to check out.  We very much enjoyed our stay in the Studio. I have coordinated two special events at this particular venue. The first time we rented the entire townhouse for my daughters bachelorette party with 10 guests! The space was amazing... Valarie has created a modern space with decor and dishes that were perfect for our occasion. We had hoped to utilize the rooftop but it happened to be too windy for our Moroccan themed tent... So we moved it indoors with a bit of shifting of furniture :) it worked out just fine. Valarie on each stay was available to meet a few requests with early check-in and extra dishes on the second visit for the studio. The only hiccup was needing some backup restock for TP that had been overlooked by the cleaning crew. She was gracious in her apologies on the oversight and made herself available for any need we might have going forward. I adore this space and will keep it at the forefront for further occasions we might plan as the Ballard community is a great place to stay in for all the delicious restaurants and shops therein! The townhouse does have extremely steep staircases so it may be a problem for anyone needing handicap access to upper levels, but the downstairs studio off the Main Street seems like it might work for a stay that does not require a kitchen and the bathroom is a large space and the shower is big and open. Valarie mentioned she may have some new Airbnb spaces opening in Feb... I will definitely keep an eye out for those as well!  We had a wonderful stay! Lisa and her husband were so prompt and accommodating to us. We were vey pleased with our stay, thank you so much!  Lisa & Karl were outstanding hosts!  They began with clear, timely, friendly communication and were wonderfully accommodating.  When we arrived, they were so pleasant and welcoming and made us and our girls feel right at home.  We have two little girls and they embraced them and extended even their own personal living space to make our stay that much more comfortable.  Lisa and Karl have a Super friendly dog and our girls loved playing with her and taking her on walks!  The home is situated in such a beautiful family oriented area of North Seattle with great neighborhood walks and parks all outside the front door.  Safe, friendly, peaceful!  Inside, the home is so nicely lit naturally with plenty of windows and the layout felt wide open and super spacious.  And with a piano and wood stove, the space also felt very homelike.  Furnishings were ample and the beds were more than comfortable!  We completely enjoyed our stay with Lisa and Karl and highly recommend their home for a stop-over stay, transition, or extended stay!  Thank you…you made our return home to Seattle this year incredibly pleasant! Their house is very clean and has two bedrooms, and big living room. It so comfortable and quiet. They are so sweet, and very king. They payed attention for comfortable stay.  Lisa house was perfect for our quick stay. She was very easy to reach and her husband met us shortly after we arrived. The place is clean, comfortable and included amenities (e.g. coffee/tea).  I\\'d definitely recommend!  What great hosts! I cannot express with words how overjoyed myself and my family were with our stay with Lisa and Karl. They made us feel warm, welcome and comfortable during our stay in Seattle. We would stay with them again in the future without hesitation! Looking for a great neighborhood with a great layout of living/sleeping/bathing accommodations? Look no further. The kicker is fantastic hosts that genuinely care about their guests!  Very warm and comfortable place to have stayed.The host couple is very nice guys ，we felt at home during the stay，highly recommended to others. The hosts were very friendly and accommodating. The description of their suite was very accurate and it was neat and clean. The neighborhood was quiet and seemed to be in a safe location. We would recommend these airbnb hosts to anyone going through the Seattle area.  Lisa and Karl were very communicative in the lead-up to our arrival. They have a beautiful house in a beautiful neighbourhood! They even cooked us Banana bread. Twice! And it was delicious. Very kind and generous hosts. Lisa and Karl were really nice hosts! They showed us around in the apartment which was very clean and tidy. Me and my friends was staying over there one night to celebrate my birthday in Seattle and we are very glad we chose this place. It\\'s in a really nice neighborhood and we felt very safe. Different kitchen equipment was available and we were also offered fruit, chocolate and coffee. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for being so nice! It was perfect for my birthday get away :)   Karl and Lisa were amazing hosts - went above and beyond in every way!  Their apartment is in a GREAT part of town - close to Ballard and bus line. This place was SPOTLESS clean and they had everything you could possibly want. I would definitely stay with them again next time through Seattle! This was my first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful. We arrived a little earlier than planned and we were warmly greeted and shown the space. It was absolutely perfect for our group and had easy access to Ballard. The amenities were comfortable and the rooms were very clean. There were Seattle guidebooks set out, as well as other books if you wanted to spend some time inside reading. We all agreed that we would definitely return and stay here again. We really enjoyed our stay here. Very clean comfortable place in a great neighborhood with lots of great bars and coffee shops nearby. Our hosts were very quick to respond to messages  before and during our stay. Would stay here again for sure! That was my first try to book in airbnb and because of that clean nice home and the great hosts it\\'s not going to be my last Awesome experience:) Truly appreciate Lisa prepared everything and also important information warmly for (website hidden), house is comfortable, and with the yamaha piano must be an exciting moment for anyone who love music. Wish to visit again. Thanks for making us feel like family. :) Lisa and Karl were great hosts. They welcomed and sent us off with freshly baked banana bread, which my family and I devoured! Treated us like family and very accommodating. Responded to communications quickly and place is very well kept and clean. Hope to see you guys again the next time we visit! Thanks! Staying here was a 100% positive experience.  Everything was so well thought out, and the accommodations couldn\\'t have been more perfect.  I didn\\'t realize that we would have our own door to the outside...RIGHT to where our car was parked...perfect!  The hosts were so friendly and obviously do this not to make money, but because they love it.  They were so helpful, even when the other mom had some complications with a car situation and had to leave luggage to be picked up later.  The hosts offered dinner ideas and even gave us coupons.  But once all the chat was done, they left us alone to have privacy.  The suite itself was spotless and I just wished we could have stayed longer...next time for sure!!!   Lisa and her husband were wonderful hosts - so friendly and quick to respond to any questions before, during and after the visit.   the place is very cozy, impeccably clean, the beds comfortable and the neighbourhood very safe and quiet.   the kitchen truly is just a small kitchenette so no where to cook (that is not a complaint, just a point to note).   We would definitely stay again in the future. My friends and I had a wonderful experience at Lisa\\'s place! Her husband greeted us upon arrival and was very kind and welcoming, even though we arrived later than expected. They happened to be having people over for dinner and extended an invite to our group of 4, but we already had plans in the city. We had lots of privacy but felt that we could easily ask for assistance if anything came up. I highly recommend this location, we had a great time!  Lisa and her husband are very nice person. They cooked bread for us when we arrived. And they provided maps, coupons for visitors. The house is nice and clean. Their puppy and cat are cute. \\nOne thing is we only found three not four.\\nAll in all, it\\'s a nice time! Lisa and Karl\\'s home was in a wonderful area not far from many places to eat or drink famous Seattle coffee. The area was the perfect size and stocked with everything you\\'d expect from two of the warmest hosts I\\'ve ever had. I\\'ve never felt more at home!  Perfect accommodations. Quiet with attentive hosts. We would recommend! My son and I were Becca\\'s very first guests!  This little room is cozy, and though it is in a basement, plenty of light comes in from the east and the walls and furniture are cheery. It was very cool inside as well.  It feels very quiet and private.  \\n\\nBecca\\'s is so sweet too.  She really wanted to make sure we were well taken care of.  She didn\\'t miss a single consideration. Very nice basement, tidy, quite and got everything you\\'ll need during your stay.\\nThe hostess was very helpfull and attended to all our needs.\\nThanks for the small treats as well! Every little detail was thought of, honey for my coffee, tea, and even a tasty chocolate treat.  Private and cozy, it is a good location within walking distance to green lake.   Becca was a perfect host. The air B&B was better than described in the pictures. Very cute, quaint, and adorable private room with separate entrance which was nice. Highly recommend her as a host. She even gave me a wonderful chocolate bar! ❤️\\r\\nThanks Becca!  We couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to stay-- home away from home. Would recomend to everyone who is looking for a small, cozy and private place to stay in Seattle. Becca is an amazing host. Becca\\'s cute little downstairs basement room was perfect.  Comfy bed. Hot shower.  My boyfriend and I found awesome bars and enjoyed an awesome breakfast place minutes away.  Super easy to get the Space Needle, EDM, etc... 6pm traffic to downtown for the Underground tour wasn\\'t too bad.  Loved being so close to Ballard district!  Id recommend Becca\\'s place!! Cozy space, nice garden, good neighborhood, great host!   Very welcoming.  Even allowed us to charge our PHEV.   Our stay in Seattle was tops due, in part, to our stay here.  Note to \\'long\\' people (>6ft) - the ceilings are low (it\\'s a basement after all), so gotta watch your head.  Becca was great! We rolled into town quite late and she stayed up to show us the apartment and give us keys. Almond milk in the fridge and a chocolate bar were a great touch. Just as cute as expected! Becca runs one of the best Airbnbs I\\'ve ever seen. She\\'s an experienced traveler, so she knows how to make her guests feel comfortable. The room is perfectly equipped and has a comfortable separate entrance. The house is an a quiet area but close enough to downtown Seattle and SLU. I\\'d definitely recommend Becca to others. My husband and I had a lovely stay in this apartment.  It\\'s located in a great part of Seattle and close to bus stops. I loved the \"little touches\" provided.  We would absolutely come back again if we\\'re in town. Becca sets the standard for Airbnb hosts! Not only did she greet us as we came in, but she showed us to the space & provided a tour. She even brought down additional condiments for coffee in the morning. This spot is perfect. It has everything you need, plus a cozy atmosphere. Becca was the ideal host! My friends and I have been traveling via Air Bnb for a month now and this was our last stop. Becca made everything so easy, comfortable, and homey that we really appreciated her as the end to our cross country trip. \\r\\n\\r\\nNot only was check-in super easy, even though we made it to the apartment fairly late, but when we arrived we were greeted with chocolate, coffee and beer in the refrigerator, a bathroom stocked with toiletries, and a clean cozy space. After a long drive, it was exactly what we needed. We could tell how much thought she put into her rental. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe were able to meet Becca the next day - and her cute dog - the next day where she provided a ton of super helpful information about Seattle and the surrounding area. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the stay was exactly what we needed and Becca was one of the most accommodating hosts we\\'ve had so far, I would definitely recommend staying at her place for your trip to Seattle!  This was a great apartment!  Everything was as described, the space was private, clean, and quiet.  Communication with Becca was easy and straightforward.  I would definitely recommend this apartment. I reserved this place for a friend of mine who needed it last minute. It was my first time on BnB and it was confusing to navigate. Becca was understanding, and made the navigation easier for me. She was able to respond very quickly to my inquiry, was very kind and accommodating. Becca\\'s studio was CUTE, clean, comfortable, equipped, and cheery. Becca left a kind note, and a rose by the bed. Plus coffee was there for the morning. I will definitely be saving this listing for when family comes into town again. Thank you Becca! Becca was very accomodating and helpful! She was always available when we needed her. The description of the apt was accurate. The neighborhood was cute and quaint and like she described as well. My girlfriend and I loved Becca\\'s basement apartment. It was just what we needed for a nice weekend in town. Her place is filled with lots of charm and made us feel at home. My fiancee and I stayed in Becca\\'s for two nights - it had everything we needed, and Becca was very helpful if we needed anything. My fiancee commented multiple times on how much she liked the style/design of the space; it\\'s very colorful. There was also plenty of parking in front of the house. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe one issue for me was the height of the ceiling. It\\'s not something that\\'s going to affect a lot of people - I\\'m 6\\'5 - but if you\\'re a tall person, you will have to duck your head to move around at times.  We had a lovely time at Becca\\'s basement apartment. She was a gracious host leaving snacks and chocolate with her welcome note. This little spot had everything we needed (even a washer/dryer!) for out two night stay. The location was on point - close to Ballard and Fremont and a great little spot called Vif. Everything else was a short ride away. Bonuses were the cute little garden entrance and her sweet doggie, Bowie. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed Becca\\'s Cozy Basement Apartment. It is just as she describes it. It\\'s quiet, clean and comfortable. It\\'s easy to find, and in a great location. We spent 3 nights, and would stay there again. We also enjoyed the Ballard area restaurants and coffee shops. We\\'ll certainly recommend this apartment to our friends. My brother and I stayed at Becca\\'s home for a night. The apartment was comfortable (even though the ceiling felt a little low). Becca and her dog were very welcoming and gave a good recommendation for breakfast. There were also a few good bars about a half mile from the home to have a nightcap. Our stay at Becca\\'s apartment was perfect! Everything was lovely, clean, nice - perfect size for two people to stay. Getting in and out was easy - I wish we had gotten to meet Becca, because all the notes in the guestbook couldn\\'t say enough good about how great she is! We would definitely stay at Becca\\'s again and would recommend her to anyone. Becca was such a kind and gracious host!\\r\\nHer place was cute, comfortable, and a great stop for us on our honeymoon. Her dog is friendly, it\\'s in a great location, and it is in a great location. We would recommend to anyone, and will be back next time we visit Seattle! Becca was a great hostess. . . super accommodating and welcoming. The local chocolate and apple snack was an unexpected perk. . . and waking up with coffee available to make was rad.\\r\\nThe #28 bus runs right by and takes you to the heart of downtown Seattle. This and the free street parking make this a great spot to adventure from.  Becca\\'s place was just as described-comfortable, clean and well equipped for my husband and I. Location was great, close to some gems including Chucks Hop Shop (great beer & food trucks) and Four Spoons (best breakfast ever!). Also within walking distance to groceries and public transportation. A longish, but totally doable, walk to Green Lake. Overall, a great value and a nice place to stay. My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Becca\\'s basement apartment.  The location was great, loved getting away from the main Seattle downtown area and into a more locals scene.  The apartment and grounds were clean, cute, and comfortable.  We didn\\'t have a chance to meet Becca but she kindly accommodated our late evening arrival and arranged to get the key to us.   In a pinch I would recommend this listing. If not, pass. After all it\\'s a basement and smells like one too! Very low ceilings and musty. My girlfriend and I had a wedding to prepare for during our stay and we encountered a blown fuse issue which meant no light or power in the location we needed it most, and that was the bathroom. With the hostess at work we were not able to take care of the situation. At that point we really missed the ease of staying at a hotel. It was a good experience but would definitely chose a different location next time. We found Becca\\'s apartment to be perfect for our stay in Seattle. It\\'s cozy and clean, with a very comfy bed. It\\'s in a great neighborhood, and between the bus and Uber we had a very easy time getting around. Her recommendations for places to eat and drink are excellent, and we found we could walk to all of them. We didn\\'t get to meet Becca face to face, as she was away during our stay. But she responds to emails very quickly, is a great communicator, and had friends available, had we needed anything. (We didn\\'t) We found her to be a thoughtful and kind host, and had a great experience! Becca was an accommodating host with her flexibility in our check in and out times. The home was in a safe neighborhood with ample street parking. The space is in a basement so it is cozy spot for 2 people. Becca\\'s personalized touches in the decor helped make this an inviting place to stay for a night. Having access to a washer/dryer in the apartment was fantastic. We enjoyed a quick drive (15 minutes or so) to the heart of Seattle and returned to this space for a quiet retreat. Becca\\'s place was perfect for our stay in Seattle.  Though described as small, it was more than enough space for 2 of us, and had many additional amenities.  Becca also has a beautiful yard, and we enjoyed sitting out there in the evening.  The neighborhood was quiet, with several restaurants/bars and a grocery store within easy walking distance. Becca was easy to communicate with, and responded very quickly to any questions we had.  Everything was great! Accurate listing! I had a great experience. Becca makes you feel very welcome. There was coffee and creamer as promised. Definitely recommend!  Becca was a very generous host. Friendly but also private. I will definitely check with her first next time I come to Seattle.   Becca was nothing but warm and welcoming. My Fiance and I had such a wonderful stay in her cozy basement apartment. It literally had everything we could need! And an adorable patio/courtyard area out front to enjoy our coffee. She gave us great dinner recommendations, and pointed us to the best place to watch the sunset with a bottle of wine - Golden Gardens State Park :) Thank you, Becca!!  Becca\\'s apt was really great, yes it\\'s  small  but it is set up in a really clever way with all you need.  Beccas personal style is evident throughout with  lots of art and quirkiness.:) my husband is 6ft 6 and he did have to bend (we knew it was height challenged when we booked) but even that didn\\'t detract as everything else was perfect! Great bus access close by and suoer mkt 15 min walk woukd def stay again Becca was really nice too :) The place was spotless when we got there, all the amenities were available, and it was exactly as described. There was a grocery store and an excellent brewhouse close by, and many great restaurants within walking distance. About a block away, there was a bus that went straight downtown, which was very convenient, and the neighbourhood felt very safe and secure. The space was small, but did not feel like it, as it was skillfully decorated. I enjoyed staying here, and would highly recommend it -- Becca was an excellent host.  We had a nice 4 night stay in Becca\\'s basement apartment.  The host was very communicative, and answered questions promptly.  The ceilings are fairly low, so you\\'ll probably only feel comfortable if you\\'re less than 6\\'.  Having a washer and dryer was convenient, and the house is close to bus lines downtown, and roughly a mile to Green Lake.   Becca\\'s little studio was perfect! She did a great job to make it feel comfortable and private.  Becca also went out of her way to make sure I had everything I need on different occasions. Great host and wonderful studio.  I had a great stay at Becca\\'s. She was very communicative and helpful!  I think it\\'s a great price for what you get, which is a very simple, comfortable, cozy apartment.  I will definitely stay again.  Becca was very hospitable and flexible, allowing me to check-in an hour early than our pre-coordinated time.  She was very friendly and even invited us to an event she was hosting.  This was a cozy apartment with all the amenities could want (coffee, laundry, etc...).  This is a great launching point for a night in Ballard and the shower is amazing too! We had a great stay at Becca\\'s place. Highly recommend this spot if you want to see Seattle outside of the tourist areas. She was very easy to communicate with and coordinate our arrival and check in time. We werden heel vriendelijk verwelkomd door de zus van de eigenaar. Zij gaf ons tips en ook Bonnie gaf via mail ons allerlei ideeën om te doen Alles in huis was overzichtelijk en schoon, de inrichting is modern. Het is een licht huis, er zijn heel veel boeken, ook in het Nederlands en het heeft een piano!  We had a great time in this beautiful Ballard neighborhood house.  We had a fantastic stay at the Hummingbird House. From the moment we booked though our whole stay our hosts were super responsive, friendly, and welcoming. Their home is beautiful and in a great neighborhood. Luckily for us, their home was very kid friendly as well and our two young boys loved their time there. We were kindly greeted by Dan who went over the house details. The home was very clean and quaint. The neighborhood was peaceful and nostalgic.  A bag of coffee beans and cream in the frig, a bottle of wine, and a list necessary housekeeping instructions made us feel welcome and immediately at home. The house is extremely clean with lovely decor, comfortable furnishings and beds, and a well-stocked kitchen. The listing description is extremely accurate - the home is definitely a \"charming craftsman\".  We especially enjoyed the beautiful backyard outdoor space, a huge flatscreen TV, and a Sonos sound system. My husband and I were traveling with another couple and the house provided both privacy and plenty of room for the 4 of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood itself is quiet with friendly neighbors and ample parking. Ballard is a great community, near enough to easily access downtown Seattle, but providing it\\'s own delightful main street shops, restaurants and activities as well.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnne and Casey are  thoughtful hosts that truly desire their guests to enjoy their home as if it was their own. Upon request, Anne provided excellent suggestions for restaurants and site-seeing ideas that catered to our preferences and made our visit to Seattle super fun and stress free.   The Location: Slightly North of Ballard - but very easy to access. The apartment is roughly a three minute walk to the bus stop for route 28 - affording easy access to Downtown Seattle. On street parking is readily available in this quiet neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Apartment: Modern and clean. It is accurately depicted in the description and the images. The space is open and has a small alcove for the sleeping area. All appliances and fixtures are new and in excellent condition. The bathroom is top-notch with a heated floor. There is a washer and dryer available in the shared space outside the apartment. FYI - I am 6FT tall and the low ceiling doesn\\'t bother me at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Host: Monika has been very responsive and is easy to get in touch with. She has extensive knowledge of the Seattle area and is very helpful with advice about restaurants, bars, and shopping. Extremely helpful, very friendly, and very accommodating.\\r\\n\\r\\nExtras: Fresh herbs are available in the backyard. There is a bike available to borrow. The apartment was ideal for us--location, accommodations, host, parking,etc. It is new and tastefully decorated and has complete kitchen and laundry (latter shared) facilities. Everything appears brand new and is comfortable and clean, and quiet. There is a private (Illuminated) entrance through a coded garage door (no key needed). Plenty of close street parking (safe). The apartment is 1 1/2 blocks from an express bus stop to downtown and Green Lake is 5-10 min. by car.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost impressive was the attitude and hospitality of the host. She made us feel welcome and was eager to help with information, directions and advice. She even loaned us coins for bus fare for exact change to avoid extra fare charge. When returning home at night we frequently found treats, such as pie, soft drinks, and there was a welcome bottle of wine and cookies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kitchen is also clean and fully equipped, but we didn\\'t use it. The bathroom was also clean and kept that way daily. 4 stars out of 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S. There is a backyard to use, but we didn\\'t have time to use it. Staying at Monika\\'s in Ballard was Fantastic! We were either dreaming or this was HGTV come to life (only better because We actually got to stay here and not deal with hard hats ;-)). We did not see much of Monika as she works and is very involved with the local art community.  We kept contact via smart phones. She is a very warm, inviting, bubbly, and humorous hostess. She left sweet care packages for us upon arrival and a note of welcoming. We were able to leave Mighty O French Toast donuts for her and her sweet partner, Myles. \\r\\nThe apartment is very beautifully appointed, modern contemporary, and clean. Great use of space with smart use of windows and light, adorable furnishings, reading materials, touristy guides and local places to eat (we loved Olive and Grape, and Razzi\\'s (Gluten Free) pizza. The 4 Spoons was delightful!) art pieces made for a sweet stay. I loved the deep tub and shower-excellent water pressure. Monika has excellent design sense with color, shape, and form. She has made wise choices in using compact size appliances that maximize the size of the space. We also had respectful se of the laundry which we found helpful.\\r\\nI appreciated the ability to separate landfill, recycling, and compost. \\r\\nThe ceilings are low so if you are a tall person you might not like that. We had no problems.\\r\\nA very special experience for us to stay 4 nights Monika\\'s. The apartment was delightful--nicely decorated and immaculately clean.  The location was perfect.  There are so many fun things to do in Ballard.  The apartment is within a block of the bus stop so getting downtown via bus was very easy.  We were able to bicycle directly from the garage to access great bike lanes/trails.  The kitchen was nicely equipped.  We cooked several meals there; appliances and kitchen equipment were new and high quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonica was very helpful--provided music event and bus information before we arrived.  Welcome package included wine, fruit, chocolate, and various snacks.  We were in the apartment for three weeks, and having the washer and dryer and access to the garage was wonderful.  Our requests and questions were answered very quickly, but we always felt a complete sense of privacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest vacation I\\'ve ever had.  Many thanks! Monika was very friendly and helpful. She gave me many recommendations around the neighborhood and the city which made it easy for me to find nice things to do. The apartment is very clean and is nicely decorated and the neighborhood seems safe. Overall it was a pleasure to live there. Monika and Miles made us feel very welcome.  The little apartment is darling, very well appointed.  Any issues that arose were dealt with by M and M promptly and courteously.  Highly recommend our hosts and the apartment! My girlfriend and I are both travel nurses and we came to Washington from NY for work. We spent a month in Monika\\'s place and it was a great experience. The apartment is clean and has all the essentials for an extended stay. She was kind enough to have treats for us in the kitchen when we arrived. The kitchen has plenty of dishes/utensils and there are a lot of cleaning supplies already there to get us started. She was also nice enough to have plenty of towels in the bathroom.  The bedroom includes cable t.v. =) The location is also very nice.  Her home is  close to many great places to eat, supermarkets, bike trails (just to name a few things). Monika is a sweetheart and was very easy to get in touch with, if needed.  Overall, lovely experience. Miles was very accommodating and responsive as our arrival ended up being late evening arrival which was greatly appreciated!  The apartment is accurately described; very nicely appointed and spotlessly clean.  The location was excellent for us and provided easy access to Seattle and other areas around the city.  We did a fair amount of walking in the mornings and found many great restaurants within a radius of several blocks.  The neighborhood felt very safe and plenty of street parking was available.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Monika and Miles! Great stay!  Fast and clear communication with very helpful host, space is clean and new.  Kitchen is beautiful.  Quiet residential neighborhood.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSpace feels a little tight (skinny kitchen) for two people with luggage (we didn\\'t stay long enough to unpack).\\r\\n\\r\\nDescription is accurate, although I didn\\'t notice that the only entrance to the apartment is actually through a car garage door - it was fine, though. The apartment was a perfect base for my wife and me to explore Seattle, a city we\\'ve considered relocating to. The conveniently located neighborhood is quiet and residential, yet walking distance to a few pubs, restaurants, and small shops as well as bus routes for downtown and an Enterprise if you want to rent a car. The apartment is a a recent rehab/conversion with high quality appliances; new, clean, and well maintained. Kitchen is small, efficient, and well-stocked.  Ceiing is low but did not bother me at 5\\' 11\".  Felt very welcomed. Cozy and clean . Comfy bed. Would recommend it to friends. Monika was a gracious host.  We had a lovely stay. Monica had good restaurant recommendations. The apt is very nice Great location in Ballard in a quiet neighborhood. Monika was friendly and responsive but also gave us privacy. Nice to have a full kitchen, clean towels and soap. Comfortable bed. Lots of space for clothes/suitcases. Clean and tidy. Beautiful apartment! Part James Bond entrance and French Bistro ambiance once inside. Tasteful touches throughout. Enjoyed a deep soak in the tub. Monika is a gracious host, kind and easy to talk to. She had all kinds of suggestions for neighborhood restaurants, bars, etc. Location is excellent. Bed and furniture is comfy and cozy. The only downside I experienced was not their fault. I\\'m an extremely light sleeper and the mornings were a challenge for me. Most Seattle basement apartments have the bedrooms under the living room or other high traffic areas. Its just the way they are designed so any basement apartment may not be a good fit for you if you are an extremely light sleeper but frankly that is very rare. I\\'m sorry Monika I forgot to run the dishwasher on my last day! Thank you for a wonderful stay.  Monika\\'s place was excellent! Super cozy and clean with easy entry and a fully stocked kitchen! Monika was very accommodating and flexible with our arrival times and checked in to see if everything was okay. \\r\\n\\r\\nGreat location as well. Feels like the perfect home away from home. Would definitely stay here again! Ny wife and in spent a month stayibg here while I was working in the area. Our stay was a delightful experience. The apartment is very tastefully decorated with all amenities including an excellent laundry room just outside the apartment. It was quiet, conveniently located and just what we we needed for our extended stay.\\n\\nHighly recommended! My only reservation would be for those on the tall side, the ceilings are probably not higher than 6\\'6\", so for me at 6\\'3\" I had to duck a good bit. While this didn\\'t bother me personally,  I wouldn\\'t recommend the place to anyone taller than I am. \\n\\nGreat experience overall! Thanks Monika! Great experience! It us our third time booking with Monika and we plan to stay here again whenever we are in the area. Highly recommended! We spent an incredible month in Monika\\'s apartment. It has everything you need and then some. We couldn\\'t have been more comfortable or happier anywhere else. The neighborhood has so many amazing restaurants and little shops to explore and Monika is more then helpful with advising places to explore. We will definitely be back! Thank you so much  My experience here was good.  Augustine and his roommate are great hosts, and the space is exactly as described.  \\n\\nThe walls are a bit thin, and the tub drain is slow. there is no furniture other than the bed in the room, which is inconvenient, but not a big deal. Otherwise, the room is fine. Stayed here for a week, and enjoyed it very much. Augustin and his housemate J are both super cool guys, very accommodating, and made me feel very welcome. The room was very clean, nice, and modern, as was the spa style bathroom. I\\'d highly recommend! First of all,  AUGUSTIN ROCKS!!!!! \\r\\n\\r\\nHe is an awesome, generous and helpful guy. He picked up me at the airport for free! It\\'s about 30 min drive from his place to the airport. When I arrived at his place, the bed is huge. It\\'s king size, so it\\'s literally huge. And it\\'s super comfortable. The room is also huge. There is a door between bathroom and bedroom, so it\\'s very convenient. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is no desk and chair when I arrived. However, he bought me desk and chair!!! That\\'s one of the reasons why I say he\\'s awesome: he is always responsive to what the guest need, and do it quickly.  What\\'s more, he is very respectful to my privacy. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe cleaned the sheets, towels and blankets once a week. There is free washing machine and dryer in the room, fussball table, TV, big kitchen, refrigerator in the living room. \\r\\n\\r\\nAugustine is also very low profile, he said he practiced boxing, but he never mentioned that he is a boxing champion! \\r\\n\\r\\nIn sum, my stay at this place is great! It\\'s 3-week long and I really enjoy it. I wish Augustin all the best, and hope the others coming to this place enjoy their stay.      Augustin is a wonderful host! The room is very spacious and the master bathroom is accessible from inside the room as well as the hallway. Augustin\\'s housemates are very friendly, and all treat you like a welcome guest. Overall the accommodations are quite nice, I\\'m so glad I chose to stay here! Very good. Big room, big bed, private bathroom, kitchen and living room are at your disposal as well, though I did not use them. Five star, highly recommend! I loved staying at this listing. Having never stayed at an Airbnb before I was fairly apprehensive going in, however this listing was above and beyond anything I was expecting. The room was very clean, sheets were freshly washed, and the closet was stocked with anything I could think to need, from extra blankets to a fan in case it got too hot. While I was sharing a bathroom with the other roommate, fighting for bathroom time was never an issue. The bathroom itself was very impressive, it reminded me of a nice hotel, except I have never seen a hotel with a shower that had 2 shower heads, very impressive. The other roommate Jay was very friendly accommodating, always helpful and would even offer me some of the food that he would cook nightly. The owner Augustin was also extremely friendly and accommodating. He would make sure I had everything I needed, and even went so far as to invite me to one of his jiu jitsu classes (I was terrible). Overall I would highly recommend this listing, having not had any experience with Airbnb I\\'m not sure if this is normal, however I couldn\\'t have asked for a better time  Shannon was an absolute dream to rent from.  She outfitted the apartment with all kinds of personal touches to make us feel so welcomed and comfortable.  From great pre-trip communication to the hand-written welcome card, to the lovely selection of vintage records and games, to the extremely comfortable, luxurious bed, to inviting us spontaneously to enjoy the backyard on a particularly warm evening, to all the really great local recommendations, directions, maps, contact info that she meticulously arranged....to to to....there is too much to mention!  She made our first trip to Seattle completely wonderful.  Next time we visit that beautiful city, we will hope to be able to stay in her awesomely inspiring space.  Thanks so much Shannon and happy trails until we meet again! Staying at Shannon\\'s apartment in Ballard was such a treat! We were looking for something outside downtown Seattle, but located conveniently enough so that we could easily get there via public transit. Luckily, her rental is location just a few blocks from the Rapid D Line which takes you straight downtown. However, once we realized how much there was to do in Ballard, we opted to spend a few days just checking out the area and going to the beach at Golden Gardens Park. \\n\\nFrom the beginning of our stay, Shannon was very inviting and very accommodating with our check-in time. She showed great compassion for us when our next AirBnB accommodations fell through and had no problem extending our current reservation without a hassle. Her willingness to help  made us feel very comfortable with our choice, and that we were well taken care of.\\n\\nHer lower-level apartment was very cute! She supplied everything from coffee and tea  to cotton swabs and disposable razors. She even had reusable shopping bags for your groceries! Were impressed with the minimalist, yet eclectic, style of the suite, and how it had everything you needed without having too much. The bed was incredibly comfortable and clean. The shower head was also a nice treat! There is so much more we could rave about but it\\'s pretty self-explanatory in the pictures!\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for an entire apartment (that is intended as a rental and not someone\\'s actual residence) in a great neighbourhood within walking distance to bus lines and amazing restaurants, this is the place for you. It doesn\\'t feel like a basement suite because there are  full sized windows in the living area. We also felt very safe parking, and leaving, our car on the streets. I definitely recommend Shannon as a host and hope to stay here again for our next trip to Seattle! Thanks, Shannon!\\n\\n Shannon\\'s place was AWESOME! She went above and beyond her duties as a host and provided an immaculate, beautiful, and cozy space,  as well as a prepared suggestion list of places to visit during our stay. The location was excellent, walking distance to some very cool restaurants, and close to a handful of local breweries. Shannon was attentive, detail oriented, and thoughtful-I strongly recommend her place to anyone visiting Seattle. Thanks for everything, Shannon! Shannon was an unbelievable host.  She was able to accommodate us last minute and communication was fantastic.  Checking in and getting to the apartment was easy.  We LOVE the Ballard neighborhood and the apt is just amazing! Even though it states basement it\\'s really a first floor walk-up apt that gets a ton of light!  A must stay! We stayed in Shannon\\'s place in mid-August and had a wonderful stay. The place was a nice mix of artsy and elegant, equipped with all the amenities you need. The kitchen was beautifully decorated with gorgeous wood countertops and vintage designs. The bed was comfortable and had the softest sheets I\\'ve ever slept in. Shannon brought over fresh flowers from Ballard market when we arrived which made the house smell lovely throughout our stay. Shannon was a wonderful host, keeping us abreast of happenings in the neighborhood and gave us amazing recommendations for food options in the area.  Her place is an absolute gem. We will definitely stay there again the next time we are in Seattle.  Shannon\\'s place was fantastic.  It was very well-outfitted with all the amenities, and the bed was amazing.  All the logistics were incredibly easy.  I look forward to staying again in the future. My boyfriend and I stayed in Shannon\\'s apartment for a night, picking it for its proximity to the restaurants in Ballard. We had such a great stay! The space is cozy chic with so many charming touches and attention to detail. The bedroom was lovely and quiet and made for great sleeping. The kitchen was fabulous (we even took pics for our own kitchen remodeling). And yes, it does get nice light for a basement apartment. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen traveling, I much prefer to have a space that feels like home rather than be in a hotel, and Shannon\\'s place felt very comfortable and easy to spend time in. My only wish was that we could stay for more than one night! I\\'ll definitely book the space again when I return to Seattle.  We had a great time staying at this roomy apartment! Shannon was wonderful and even popped out, from upstairs, when we pulled up to the place to give us the keys. She even gave us a picnic basket & blanket to take to our concert at the zoo. So accomadating!\\r\\nWe wish we would\\'ve stayed longer and joked that we could take this apt back to Idaho with us. \\r\\nThanks again Shannon! Shannon\\'s apartment was such a pleasure to stay in and she is sweet and accommodating to boot!  Everything we needed was provided plus a few flourishes that she went out of her way to provide, like some snacks and recommendations.  The apartment was spotless and totally functional when we felt like lazing around after a long day of walking - the record player and equipped kitchen were put to good use!  I will definitely be recommending this apartment to friends who are looking to stay in Ballard. My stay at Shannon\\'s cozy, Ballard apartment couldn\\'t have been better! The place is much more spacious than I had expected and filled with all kinds of amenities. From the freshly picked plums and flowers from the backyard to the lush towels, assorted teas and slippers left in the bedroom, I was reminded why an AirBNB experience can be so much more superior to a regular, old hotel stay. While the apartment was sparkling clean, streamlined and airy with a mid-century modern vibe, the touches were so personal and thoughtful. I never wanted to leave! And that rain shower nozzle in the bathroom REALLY sealed the deal. I can\\'t wait to plan my next visit to Seattle!  Shannon\\'s Ballard apartment was perfect for a weekend stay in Seattle.  Impeccably clean, beautifully decorated and in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to Ballard\\'s bars, restaurants, etc. (and a quick drive to downtown Seattle).  The bed was beyond comfortable - couldn\\'t help but sleep late!  We were 100% pleased with our stay.    My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Shannon\\'s super cute apartment! It was so much bigger than we expected and there were so many amenities! We were only there a day but wished we had longer. We played board games, listened to the records she had, looked through magazines, and had a peaceful sleep. The kitchen was super outfitted, we were sad we didn\\'t have any cooking to do to be able to use all the cool stuff! \\r\\nShannon was super communicative and friendly, and met us there to give us the keys, accommodating the tight schedule we had for getting to a wedding. The location was great for us as we mainly wanted to hang out in Ballard and the lakes and wanted a cute neighborhood feel as opposed to staying downtown.\\r\\nWe would definitely stay here again in the future! Shannon\\'s place was clean, spacious and very comfortable. She provides all the little things the traveler might expect from a hotel (a closet with clothes hangers, extra towels, hairdryer, etc), plus lifestyle touches such as a turntable and records, books and maps, nice coffee and tea and even organic milk to put in it! Plus a thoughtfully appointed kitchen. There is nothing more we could have asked for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is a lovely one and it\\'s a short walk from a good bakery for morning pastry. Shannon left a nice guide to the local spots.  \\r\\n\\r\\nShannon was quick to respond and reach out to coordinate check-in/check out, which happened effortlessly. We have nothing but praise for Shannon and her MIL Apartment! \\r\\n We had an amazing stay at Shannon\\'s place! It\\'s the perfect size for 2. Clean and cute! Thanks for being so accommodating! We\\'ll be back! We had a nice and relaxing stay in the apartment which was bigger than we expected. The place was clean and did not lack anything. I was impressed by the beautiful kitchen, but unfortunately, our short stay and the available great restaurants in close proximity did not allow for doing any cooking in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood with good connections to Downtown and University District. The heart of Ballard is only a walking distance away.\\r\\n\\r\\nShannon was a friendly and helpful host. Upon inquiry she arrange that we can check in prior to the listed check in time, which made our transfer from one accommodation to the other so much easier. We didn\\'t interact much with Shannon as she was not in town during our stay but she was lovely when we she handed us the keys and explained everything perfectly. The apartment was nice and quaint and in a cute little neighborhood, the kitchen was lovely but we were gone most of the day so we didn\\'t actually cook there. The bed was super comfy though, probably the best part of our whole stay!  Shannon was a perfect host.  Even though we never met her personally, she made certain that everything was in perfect order.  We never lacked for anything and found her renovated basement apartment to be the coziest and most inviting place we\\'ve ever stayed.  The surrounding neighborhood is exceptionally quiet and we always found a parking space right out front.  I can\\'t recommend this apartment enough.  We had such a great stay! I absolutely adore Shannon\\'s space!  My husband and I stayed for two nights on our trip to Seattle.  The apartment is cosy, bright, and welcoming. I loved the balance of a clean, minimalist aesthetic with warm vintage touches.  Simple, not overdone.  The record player and board games made for an old-time-y evening.  Her little amenities really make the whole experience - plush towels, amazing bedding, rain shower head, tea & coffee and a kitchen I wanted to take home with me!\\r\\n\\r\\nShannon was easy to communicate with.  She was there to greet us when we arrived.  She was flexible and even texted to offer us a later checkout when the next guests were arriving later.  Such a nice, thoughtful person.  I highly recommend staying with Shannon.  I hope we\\'ll be back! Staying at Shannon\\'s place was a delight. She accommodated our late check-in, was indispensable as a local resource and responded  immediately to any of our messages. We were floored upon our arrival: the space is incredible and the details matter. We found refreshments in the fridge and jazz on the radio. What a treat. Our only regret was not saving enough time to meet her in person. We\\'ll be back.  This was a great place to stay during our short trip to Seattle! It was very quiet and even though it is a converted (above-ground) basement, it had plenty of light throughout. Shannon was very communicative and has all sorts of little goodies to make your stay awesome. Oh...... and the bed is one of the most comfortable beds that I\\'ve ever slept in!  I loved Shannon\\'s place! It was bigger than I expected and extremely comfortable. Two people would probably enjoy it even more because they\\'d have plenty of space to spread out and listen to music or cook.\\r\\n\\r\\nI only saw Shannon briefly but she was helpful with my late arrival and messages throughout my stay to make sure I had everything and was comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly recommend staying here!\\r\\n Shannon\\'s place was perfect for me - private, quiet, centrally located to where I was going, spacious, comfortable, very clean, and well-appointed.  There is no TV (I don\\'t watch anyhow), and even with gorgeous weather like I got, you are likely to need the wall heaters with the chilly floors (but chenille socks provided!).  Lots of closet space and hangers, modern appliances in kitchen, thoughtful touches like maps, blow-dryer, guidebooks and restaurant suggestions (plus Pellegrino, coffee and candies!).  Highly recommended! I\\'m sad that this is my first Airbnb experience because nothing else will top this.  It\\'s the perfect place, perfectly cozy, perfectly quiet, WARM, and with the perfect host. The location was outstanding, with easy access to everything we wanted to do in Seattle and the East Side.\\r\\nDetails: Bed was perfect with nice, new, warm coverings. Kitchen had everything we could have wanted and it made me want to stay longer so we could find something to cook. Bathroom was fully appointed with dozens of fresh towels. The living area was extra comfortable and we used the record player almost non-stop. Even though it\\'s a basement apartment, it\\'s full of light and is very easy to keep warm.\\r\\nWe can\\'t say enough about our host - she was friendly and communicative while being extremely professional. Her care and taste in appointing the rooms was evident.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short - I wish we could keep this little secret to ourselves, but everybody deserves to stay here! Loved Washington, loved Ballard, loved the apartment! Seriously if anyone is reading through these comments and deciding to choose or not choose this apartment.... Go with this one. \\n\\nShannon was so sweet on arrival, quick tour and left the keys with us. We were in Seattle getting married- she left a bottle of champagne for us with a cute little note.  Thank you for that, Shannon! \\n\\nFor a basement apartment- it does not feel like one at all. Roomy with lots of light and a very simple and tasteful decor makes it feel welcoming. Fairly easy to find, located in a quiet neighborhood and a maybe 10 minute drive from downtown Seattle. \\n\\nThe bed is amazing! I had to ask Shannon where she got the sheets because I need those at home. \\nI loved the variety of teas, the little footies, and that coffee maker. \\nWe are already planning of when we can come back. (: I had another great stay at Shannon\\'s apartment. She left a nice note thanking me for the return visit and thought I might enjoy reading one of her architecture/design books during my stay, which I did. It was directly relevant to the house my wife and I are building. Very thoughtful!\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, I would recommend Shannon\\'s place to anyone.\\r\\n My husband and I needed a place to stay for our friends\\' wedding and Shannon\\'s place was not only in the perfect location, but was the right price and extremely comfortable to stay in. She accommodated our requests to check-in early and check-out late as I was in a wedding party and needed some flexibility. She was extremely sweet and showed us the apartment and how to use an awesome coffee percolator (makes such delicious, rich coffee!!). The apartment is awesome, even our friends who live in Ballard stopped by to see it and knew we\\'d found a gem! We\\'ll definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to our friends if they have family or friends visiting from out of town that want a genuine Seattle experience. Thank you, Shannon!! Shannon\\'s place is great! We loved her apartment and the Ballard neighborhood. We were close enough to walk to places like the Fat Hen for breakfast and the Urban Market for a sandwich/take out (yum!!). The bus to downtown is a breeze, super convenient. Overall, Shannon\\'s place was pretty much perfect! We were there in November when Seattle is a little chilly and with the heaters we were perfectly comfortable in the downstairs apartment. As others said you get plenty of light in there too. Shannon is so thoughtful, not a detail missed and we appreciated the truffles and socks!  We couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to stay for a week in Seattle…highly recommended!!  This place was perfect!  Shannon made sure we had everything we needed, down to fancy organic cream for our coffee.  The bed was almost too comfortable, and she had plenty of games, books and records stashed here and there for the (common) cold and rainy day.  She even surprised us with a bottle of prosecco to help me celebrate my birthday!  We can\\'t wait to come back and stay longer. shannon\\'s place was perfect for us. the apartment was well stocked, clean, and the bed was excessively comfortable. key exchange was effortless, communication was great. i\\'d recommend to anyone, anytime. Shannon was a gracious, considerate, and generous host. Apartment is cozy and extremely clean. The kitchen is well appointed; bathroom\\'s nice and stocked with fresh towels, q-tips, Kleenex, etc.; bedroom was furnished with a soft rug, large closet, and big soft bed next to a window facing the lovely front garden. The unit got *pretty* good light for being partially below-ground. Nice details throughout, on a quiet, pretty block with tons of available street parking. Would definitely stay again.   Shannon\\'s place is absolutely adorable. It\\'s like having your own little apartment in Seattle- quaint kitchen and all. Shannon was SO helpful when it came to suggestions for restaurants, venues, and places to shop. Check in and check out was simple. The apartment is a 20 minute walk from the main Ballard strip with a ton of great restaurants! I recommend staying here for part if not all of your stay!\\n Super cozy sheets & nice decor.  The brief stay was very enjoyable and Shannon was prompt with a last minute request!  Thank you! We had a fantastic time in Seattle over the holiday. The adorable little apartment we rented from Shannon was perfect: private, quiet, clean, and modern. Everything was in order and a plenty (towels, dishes, etc.) and the little details were just superb, right down to the slipper socks and the assortment of herbal teas. It was like the space was custom outfitted just for us (ginger chews and wasabi peas? our faves!). The location was great for quick trips into downtown or the nearby Fremont and Queen Anne neighborhoods, and we enjoyed ourselves just as much staying in a couple of nights to play games and records (the soundtrack to Vision Quest rules!) and cuddle in the big comfy bed. Thanks for helping to make our stay in the Emerald City truly wonderful.  This cozy little apartment is just as described, we had a lovely stay there during a freezing weekend in December and managed to stay quite warm and comfortable.  Great neighborhood, very quiet but accessible to lots of great restaurants and shops nearby.  Shannon provides lots of extras in the apartment, like records, great tea and coffee, truffles, extra cozy bedding, and fuzzy socks. It was a great stay and I highly recommend this airbnb! A great place in a great neighborhood. Shannon took care with certain details in her place (coffee, decoration) and it really made the stay better than nice. Definitely would stay here again if I return to Seattle!  My husband and I visited Seattle for a few days before Christmas and we had a great time at Shannon\\'s suite.  It was absolutely perfect. The place was super clean, cozy and stocked with everything you would need in order to have a great stay.  I especially loved that there was no t.v. but lots of games to play. \\r\\nBallard is an awesome area, lots of great places to eat, shop and just peruse in general. Everything was so close, ample parking and I would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a unique place to visit in Seattle.  Thank you Shannon! I didn\\'t stay here;  my daughter did when she visited from CA with her two teenagers.   She loved it.  It was cozy and quiet and most comfortable.   A haven for her. What a great stay. Shannon made it super easy to coordinate and made us feel right at home. The place was clean and cozy, with some goodies set out for us; even a bottle of champagne in the fridge for New Year\\'s! We had a wonderful time staying there and it was so close to the bus lines for easy travel. I would recommend this place again and again. Shannon\\'s place is honestly the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at.  I have used Airbnb several times when I travel for work and this was by far the most comfortable and accommodating. I will try and stay here every visit to Seattle!  Thanks Shannon! Shannon & her apartment were great.  The apartment was spacious, stylish and immaculate.  Shannon left treats that were appreciated, and check-in & check-out were smooth. It was my third stay at Shannon\\'s place and I plan to stay there again on future work trips. It is super comfortable, big, in a nice neighborhood, etc. All the positive reviews people give the place are true. Highly recommended. Shannon\"s place is awesome, we didn\\'t want to leave. Great location, great amenities, completely private. As others have said, it is the little touches Shannon leaves for her guests that make the experience so wonderful.  Also try the High Life restaurant for brunch or dinner- ask for Travis he is a great waiter. Very enjoyable experience. This was my second stay with Shannon; I came bqck for the ease, central location, comfort, convenience and the great entertainment available in the (website hidden). all the classic books you\\'ve wanted to read but might not have gotten too yet, and while you\\'re perusing them, you can nibble on the chocolate bonbons or ginger chews (best variety) that Shannon provides and there is a book of drawing challenges so you can leave a sample of your artistic aspiration there. Finally, when you have to sleep, the silky soft sheets will tempt you to float away...way past your wake up call. So, even if you have nothing special to do in Ballard, you can do something special staying right here. Try it and you\\'ll be surprised when you receive your receipt after your stay-HA! Mystery treat. My second visit to Shannon\\'s revealed to me the most beautiful Camellia in Ballard, right out back! And Shannon is an active neighborhood gardener, a responsive, accommodating hostess who offers an ideal, quiet spot central to everything in Ballard. She offered to send me something I inadvertently left behind and diligently looked for something I thought I left behind but ultimately found I didn\\'t. Very pleasant experience with Shannon both times I stayed there and if and when the occasion arises again to stay in the area, I\\'ll know where to look for ease, comfort, convenience, cost-effective, cozy, clean, quiet digs. You should try it too! We loved Shannon\\'s space! She made the small place very comfortable and clean. For those looking to stay in, Shannon\\'s apartment has a record player and endless games; perfect for a rainy evening. Ballard is a quaint and friendly community with many small bistros and cafes serving local fare. Parking was easy and Shannon was very accommodating. Staying at Shannon\\'s was lovely! The place was just as described and show in the photos, and actually even larger than I thought. It was conveniently located by the bus stop downtown, as well as a lot of cute bars and restaurants. She also provided extra goodies for us: prosseco, candies and coffee which was unexpected and a nice treat. The bed was heavenly, so comfortable, I slept great!  It was slightly chilly, but she made up for that with cozy socks, bathrobes and there are small heaters in the space that would warm up nicely. I highly recommend her place to anyone visiting the area.  Host was congenial and welcoming.  Space was everything promised and more.  Tastefully and cleverly furnished and decorated.  Very, very comfortable.  The combination of retro and current was charming. This place was perfect!  My fiance and I stayed for 5 nights at Shannon\\'s place in Ballard.  The space is comfortable and super nice.  She has everything you could possibly want or need for you in the apartment.  This was my first airbnb experience and I was extremely pleased.  We also enjoyed that it was a change of for us pace (instead of a boring hotel) and we felt like we really were part of the neighborhood by staying here.  Ballard is a great community; we were able to walk to pretty much anything we wanted and we could be in downtown in about 30 minutes by bus.  I would highly recommend Shannon\\'s place!  Super clean and unique apartment with a very comfortable bed.  Shannon was very helpful, and we would love to stay here again sometime.   Working with Shannon was so easy! She was very friendly and easy to get hold of. Her apartment was perfectly furnished and the bed was the most comfortable bed we\\'ve slept in while traveling. The shower was great, too! \\r\\nI made coffee with the provided percolator and fresh ground beans. I know I was in Seattle, but it was SERIOUSLY the best coffee I\\'ve ever had. Enjoying a cup on the comfy couch in the plush robe was a highlight of my trip. Very cozy and comfortable place to stay. We had a wonderful stay at Shannon\\'s place.  Quiet and cozy.  Everything you could possibly need (except a microwave and TV as stated - which was fine by us!).  Nice location. Daily hikes around Green lake. Gracious hostess.  We\\'ll be back! Shannon was a wonderful host! We had a great stay in Seattle and got engaged while we were there! She had a very comfortable, updated and clean apartment in a great location with things easily accessible. She was able to accommodate us on an early check in when our plane arrived early in the day which was very appreciated and let us use her umbrella when it rained. Thanks Shannon for a great stay in Seattle!!\\n Shannon was a great host! The apartment was clean, homey, and centrally located. The bed was super comfortable, and the amenities were exactly what we were looking for. Shannon was quick and responsive to our requests and I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Great location! Great apartment! Super clean and has everything you need to make your stay enjoyable. The bed was extremely comfortable!\\r\\n\\r\\nShannon was easy to reach, very friendly and quick to respond. We loved the neighbourhood. Quiet but close to a series of neat little restaurants. I would highly recommend this place to anyone I know. Thanks, Shannon! Our stay was ok. Plenty of towels. Place was furnished tastefully. Concrete floors can be a problem in the winter but she makes up for it with socks.. Slippers will be a good idea.. Ballard is an retro funky neighborhood. Most of the unit rentals will be basements, so be cautious cuz they may be moldy..   Shannon was such a gracious host. The place was exactly as advertised and super cozy. Everything was clean and Shannon thought of every detail in terms of what a guest may need. Very convenient to several restaurants and a really great breakfast place (the fat hen). We loved staying in the neighborhood! Easy parking for those who rented cars. Great morning coffee, fun records to play while getting ready and lots of games for those rainy nights (if that\\'s your thing). Thanks Shannon!! This was our favorite traveling experience with Airbnb yet. We absolutely loved Shannon\\'s well appointed apartment. We spent most of our time there marveling at what a superb job she has done decorating and anticipating a guest\\'s every need. It was in a lovely quiet neighborhood and close to our family - we will definitely be back if she will have us!  This was our first Airbnb experience and I couldn\\'t imagine using anything else now! Shannon was an absolutely wonderful host. Her place was just as advertised if not even better and included all of the amenities we could have ever wished for on our stay. The fridge was stocked with a nice bottle of wine, fresh milk, sparkling water, and coconut water and the house was located in a super cute neighborhood which was walking distance to some of the best restaurants (Delancy, Fat Hen) I\\'ve been to in a while. \\nWe were in Seattle for a friends wedding and there was always an Uber car less than 5 minutes away and downtown was no more than 10 minutes away.\\nShannon was even sweet enough to let us check out at 5pm since our flight was not until 8pm that day which was very sweet of her. \\nWe would definitely recommend her place to anyone in the Seattle area and hope to return soon! Shannon\\'s apartment was great.  Her description of the unit was spot on.  I didn\\'t use much of anything except for the bed, heat, and the shower (great pressure, one of the best showers I\\'ve ever experienced).  But the place was everything you could ask for if you plan to be out and about in Seattle and need a very comfortable place to relax afterward.\\r\\n\\r\\nShannon was great upon check-in and check-out and offered some great suggestions on Seattle. Shannon was great. Very easy to work with.  My parents stayed in her MIL apt. when they visited me.  She is only a few blocks from my home. Her apartment was lovely. Very nicely appointed and spacious. My parents have stayed in several other places when visiting me and this was their best experience. Ideally located in Seattle. Close to bus lines, convenient to downtown, many good restaurant choices within walking distance and very quiet and safe neighborhood.  I highly recommend staying with Shannon. I will definitely reserve her place the next time my family visits. Shannon was a wonderful host.  She was easy to contact and very accommodating.  She even let my boyfriend drop off all of his things before the check-in time. Everything you could ever need was supplied in the apartment and there wasn\\'t anything superfluous, which I loved.  She even supplied us with a coffee grinder when we asked and let us hang out in the backyard on the day we checked out while we waited for our taxi.  The apartment is in a great location.  If you don\\'t mind walking you can walk to downtown Ballard, but there are also plenty of other great things within walking distance.  Her recommendations for restaurants in the area were wonderful.  We went to 3 that were on her list and all of them exceeded our expectations.  We will definitely stay here again when we visit Seattle. Shannon was the perfect host. Her attention to detail is reflected in every aspect of her lovely Ballard apartment. The bed linens were soft and luxurious and the bed so comfortable.  The kitchen was well-stocked with various blends of teas and a Bialetti coffee pot and coffee made me feel at home!  The neighborhood was safe, quiet and is in close proximity to both Green Lake and Ballard.  Next time I am in Seattle, I will definitely stay here again.  Thank you, Shannon!   Shannon greeted us and filled us in about the nuances of her quaint, clean place.  Her suggestions were not only spot on, but very helpful.  She helped us navigate a new route to the airport as there was construction issues that we wouldn\\'t have known about if she hadn\\'t helped us.  We highly recommend the stay at Shannon\\'s in Ballard.   It was everything as advertised and more!  Who knew we would get such a kick out of listening to her albums...everything from Dave Brubeck to the \"Vision Quest\" soundtrack!  Lot\\'s of things like that made it a memory rather than just a place to stay. We loved Shannon\\'s place and what she has done with it! It was so quiet and the bed is super comfortable, I think we got some of the best sleep we\\'ve had in a long time.  We loved all of the little nice touches as well including chocolates and coffee, robes and lots of clean towels.  The location is great (we did have a car to get around) on a quiet street in Ballard and close to Phinney Ridge.  Lots of great restaurants and coffee nearby! We had booked a hotel for the last few nights of our trip but wish we had just stayed at Shannon\\'s place the entire time.  Shannon was extremely nice and accommodating.  Would definitely stay here again! Everything was as expected.  Shannon made getting the keys easy and was very pleasant and welcoming.  The apartment was very clean and Shannon has thought of just about everything.  Plenty of good quality towels, kitchen well equipped, etc.  The bed is a good one and cozy as the listing says. I loved the robe and comfy socks.  My daughter lives in the neighborhood which is why I was there.  It\\'s safe and pleasant to be in.  \\r\\nUnfortunately Seattle is damp even in the summer.  Or perhaps it was that this is a basement apartment so that paper bags couldn\\'t retain crispness. On the other hand the place remained cool despite temperatures in the mid 80\\'s.  Also despite being a basement apartment it gets the sun in summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy only problem was with the concrete floors.  They detract from the apartment making it cold looking.  They are unpleasant to walk on.  At the very least I think they should be painted.  Thankfully the bathroom had linoleum tile.\\r\\n Shannon\\'s place was super!  We were up for a wedding in the Ballard area and wanted to stay near by.  Shannon\\'s place was just perfect!  Decorated so nicely and such a great location!  We walked to The Fat Hen for breakfast one morning and then grabbed a bus to downtown Ballard (just a 5 minute ride).  We had a rental car as well which was handy for other city exploring, but there\\'s plenty on foot or a quick bus ride from Shannon\\'s too.  She was also great to communicate with, and always responded quickly! We so enjoyed staying at Shannon\\'s airbnb she is a class act and goes beyond to make guests feel comfortable and the space is cozy hip and equipped with everything we needed! I will look forward to staying there again! Echoing all the other reviews -- Shannon\\'s place was absolutely charming! We were coming off a long weekend racing and couldn\\'t have picked a better spot to unwind and relax! The apartment was just perfect - quiet, well appointed (I did not want to leave!) and well situated -  I\\'d stay here again in a heartbeat! The neighborhood is cute and is centrally located to great eats/drinks. We had a car, but had we not been coordinating with folks all over town, we wouldn\\'t have needed it - much is accessible on foot, and the bus is super close for getting downtown. Shannon was incredibly flexible (our check in time kept changing) and very responsive.  This apartment was bright, fun and filled with so many unexpected amenities. It was beyond my expectations in both convenience and comfort.   Staying at Shannon\\'s place was great. We felt very comfortable and safe there. Since we had a car, it was good for us to stay a little out of the center of town but in an area with easy access to everything we wanted to see. We also enjoyed checking out Ballard and other surrounding neighborhoods. We also appreciated that parking was easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nShannon\\'s place was very clean. The decor is cute and hip. The kitchen was especially well stocked with plenty of dishes and all the coffee we could drink (which is quite a bit)! \\r\\n\\r\\nShannon was helpful and friendly. She left some useful lists of restaurants and other things to check out in the local area.  Shannon\\'s place was beautiful! Every little detail was amazing! There were so many conveniences there that made my stay so much easier. To the little snacks she left on the adorable kitchen table, to the little jar of bathroom products which came in handy because i forgot my shampoo! \\r\\nThe feel of the place was warm and welcoming. She also had a helpful list of numbers and local bars and restaurants which came in handy when we went out for a drink. Would definitely recommend! If i was staying in Ballard again i would stay here for sure!! Thanks for being an awesome host!  Shannon was an excellent host. Everything was as described and she was on point in providing materials with details on transportation and other areas of interest. I can only resonate with everyone else about the place!  It was in a great location and a nice quiet neighborhood. The interior was tastefully decorated, clean and organized. The bed was very comfortable.  Public transportation was very accessible and conveniently located just blocks away. Everything went very smoothly from start to finish.  I would highly recommend staying with Shannon on a visit to Seattle. The place is exactly as advertised. It is cozy, welcoming and very clean. There were little touches in the apartment that made our stay really pleasant. Shannon\\'s recommendations for the neighborhood were spot on. The main drag is about a 15 minute walk away, but there are some hidden gems a few minutes away. Shannon was easy to communicate with. She made the process easy. We\\'d stay here again. This was the trip of a lifetime!  Shannon was an excellent host and the amenities were perfect for my travel plans.  Next time I am in Seattle I will totally return! The Cozy Hip Vintage MIL is a wonderful place to stay when visiting Seattle.  Watch out!  The bed is dangerous because it is so comfy.  give yourself at least one morning to sleep in or stay in bed reading.  Shannon was easy to work with for checking in, she answered questions quickly and provided many little touches that made make this apartment cute.   Shannon contacted me the night before to confirm our arrival time. We got there, and she showed us the place and gave us some ideas of where we could go for food and sightseeing. It was a very smooth process and pleasant experience. My girlfriend and I enjoyed staying there. Cozy thick socks were a plus, and we definitely took advantage of her sweet collection of vinyls! The electricity did go out briefly one night (rarely happens), and even though it didn\\'t affect us at all (we were out) she was apologetic and kept us updated on when it did come back which was much appreciated. Overall, highly recommended host and place for your next AirBnb destination. :) Shannon was a great host, and her MIL apartment in Ballard was the perfect fit. A quite part of a great neighborhood, a great apartment with more space than I thought there would be, and an accommodating host that made sure I had everything I needed. The Cozy Hip apartment was a great place to stay.  Location worked well for my work, and Shannon has the apartment nicely appointed.  The check-in was easy, and the bed, as others have said, is very comfortable.  Thank you, Shannon! Shannon communicated with a phone call shortly after our arrival and after that it was easy to communicate via text. The apartment was lovely and matched the description to a \"t\". The accommodations were very comfortable and we appreciated all the extra little touches: comfortable bathrobes and warm socks, fluffy towels, candies on the kitchen table. The bed is amazingly comfortable, equal to any in a good hotel. We love the Ballard neighborhood and it was very convenient for us near the relatives we were visiting on Phinney Ridge. We loved our stay at Shannon\\'s adorable MIL apartment!  We arrived about an hour earlier than we had predicted, and Shannon was super accommodating!  She even suggested a great spot to grab a cocktail while she finished up.  We loved the unit when we got in - pictures don\\'t do it justice!  She has done an incredible job making the space feel cozy and personal.  The furnishings are perfect - everything you need to get by, but not too many distractions to keep you from exploring the awesome neighborhood.  Shannon\\'s recommendations for dining, shopping, and sightseeing were super helpful for the days where we were short on plans.  The location is also very central, everything in the city we wanted to see was no more than a 15-20 minute drive (public transport seemed to be close by as well!), though Ballard, Fremont, and Phinney Ridge have so much going on you might not make it downtown!  The apartment was also fully stocked with fresh towels, clean dishes, bathrobes, and even a candy dish!  All the accoutrements of a 5-star hotel but without the sterility.  Shannon was a perfect host, very communicative, and very helpful.  Honestly a model Airbnb experience.  Will most definitely be back!  Thank you Shannon!!!! Shannon was great, and very easily reachable! ... We had an excellent time in this lovely little neighborhood in Seattle. I would highly recommend her for traveling, and would certainly stay with her again! Shannon welcomed us when we arrived, gave us a tour of the apartment, and then let us do our thing. The apartment itself was cute, comfortable, and well-stocked with everything we needed, and the location itself was great - it was good value for money and we\\'d happily stay here again. Great place to spend a few nights in Ballard. We had all we needed and more....comfy bed, towels galore, well supplied kitchen. Next time we are in town, we will book again. We arrived after a bit of a rough week, so it was wonderful to just feel  cozy and relaxed from the moment we walked into the apartment. We put on a record from the collection, made ourselves a tea from the great little assortment of loose leaf teas, and loved exploring the \"vintage hip\" deco and all the thoughtful little touches Shannon has added to the place. It\\'s a super cute, joyful apartment with everything you could need. Everything is in perfect shape and done beautifully. It feels warm and personal, but at the same time like an upscale boutique hotel (where you get a full kitchen plus a cozy living room on top, for a price that\\'s a steal). Shannon is a kind and caring host with a great eye for detail. \\r\\nThe neighbourhood was perfect for us; it\\'s a sweet, relaxed residential area, and the bonus is that you have some of Seattle\\'s best eats within a couple blocks (5 min max) walking distance. Delancey\\'s for incredible wood-fired pizza, Essex for crafty cocktails and small plates, Honore Artisan Bakery and The Fat Hen for brunch/lunch are all really excellent. Loved the Phinney Ridge/Ballard neighborhoods in general, and the drive to downtown is really short.\\r\\nOverall, highly recommend and we\\'ll definitely be back! We wanted a fun place to spend a mother daughter weekend, and this was the perfect find! We had a blast sightseeing during the day and then knowing we had such a soft place to land made it fun to go home at the end of the day. Shannon went above and beyond to make the space delightful. She literally thought of everything you would want/need and then some. The bed was so comfortable and everything felt in spit spot shape. Hospitality is clearly Shannon\\'s gifting because she made it feel so comfortable and like a place you will want to visit again. It is located in a quiet neighborhood but within walking distance of some fabulous places to eat. It was the perfect backdrop to have a leisurely tea and breakfast morning and then a great place to listen to records (there is a record player/records to borrow) and play card games at night. We can\\'t wait to come back in the Summer to see Seattle in bloom!  The host was incredibly accommodating and prompt with her responses (getting back to any questions or e-mails within minutes of being sent out). The apartment was even cozier then expected and instantly felt like home. The added touch was the personalized note and decadent treats she left us to enjoy upon our arrival and through out our stay. The neighbourhood was the reason we chose this apartment since it was so close to all of the shops and restaurants we wanted to visit along the Ballard strip. The host left us great recommendations of places to eat, shop, visit, which added must do\\'s to our list. We would not hesitate to stay here again and will be recommending it to any of our friends and family members who are looking for somewhere in the Ballard area. Thank you for having supplied us with such a fantastic home away from home for my husbands birthday weekend in one of our favourite cities!!  Shannon was very accommodating to our ever changing travel schedule. Her apartment is in a cute neighborhood with lots of fun restaurants to walk to! Super clean apartment with a very Seattle-like vibe. The apartment was great and the bed was extremely comfortable. There was a fun record player, board games, and books that were available as well and a really cute kitchen that unfortunately, I didn\\'t get the chance to cook in. Next time! I enjoyed my stay in Shannon\\'s clean and cozy basement apartment. It is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood with ample parking and convenient transit. Shannon was communicative and overall I enjoyed my time in Seattle! My boyfriend and I stayed at Shannon\\'s basement apartment for a week and it was WONDERFUL! The apartment is really comfortable and cozy, and the kitchen is great. We arrived to a fresh gallon of milk in the fridge, a bowl of chocolate truffles (they were gone really quickly), and nice fluffy robes. Everything you could possible need was provided! I wish I had brought some slippers because the concrete floors were a tad cold. We even had a minor incident with the water heater breaking and pooling, but Shannon was awesome! Shannon was responsive in the middle of the night, and had the heater replaced the next day while we were out and about. This could have tarnished our vacation but there was no inconvenience. Not to mention she brought us flowers and cider : ) In addition, the local restaurants are great - try the Delancey, Honore Bakery, and the Fat Hen. We had bikes with us which made exploring Ballard a wonderful experience. Would love to stay here again and this stay has made us decide we\\'ll be making a move to Ballard! Thanks! : ) This was my first Air BnB experience and I could not have been happier. This is a dedicated space with lots of amenities. Shannon had everything ready on time, the hand off was super easy and the apartment was really clean with tons of fun stuff to do. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is great. Highly would absolutely recommend this space for anyone looking for a starting point for a Seattle adventure.  Shannon\\'s place is absolutely adorable and I can\\'t say enough good things about it. She makes the check in and stay seamless. The location is perfect. The bed is so comfortable!! And more. She clearly pays attentions to detail. Thanks for a lovely week Shannon and I\\'ll definitely try to re book in future visits.  This was such a perfect place to stay! The apartment is adorable, immaculate, fun and functional. I can\\'t imagine wanting anything more from an AirBnB. The location is in a very cute residential neighborhood in Ballard. There were some great restaurants very close to the apartment, and downtown Ballard has tons of restaurants and cafes! I loved it here.  We loved Ballard and the home was great! Clean and the kitchen had more than we needed!  Great basement unit! Really loved the style! The wall heaters worked great even though it was cold out. Parking was convenient. Internet was fast and worked great. Shannon was a very good host and communicative, both prior to and during our stay. We also really appreciated that she let us keep our bags in the apartment after we checked-out, since our flight was at midnight. We also really liked the detailed rules and suggestions (for bars, restaurants, etc.) she left for us. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment is quiet and very comfortable. Great amenities, an amazing kitchen, and everything exactly as described. \\r\\n\\r\\nBallard is a really nice neighborhood, quiet and cute. It\\'s about a 30 min bus ride to downtown Seattle, much shorter if you take Uber or Lyft (around 10 mins if there\\'s no traffic, and about $15-20). I think the distance is manageable if you don\\'t have to be in downtown Seattle all the time. Unfortunately, we had to be in downtown Seattle from early morning until late evening for a conference, three days in a row. So the location didn\\'t end up working perfectly for us, but if you have a more laid back schedule, then Ballard is really great. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, we had a good experience and I would definitely recommend the apartment and Shannon as a host.  This Ballard MIL is cozy and cute... Very good for a base of you have lots of local activities planned. Take note that there is no oven or microwave, so reheating stuff is on stovetop only. And, you can here renters in upstairs house --- they were respectful of quiet times, just don\\'t be surprised if you can clearly hear folks playing Yahtzee at 9pm. Shannon is great host and the place is accurately described... Cozy!  Shannon was very helpful in setting us up at her place. The apartment was adorable and freshly cleaned. Great location for public transit. Had a wonderful stay! Shannon\\'s apartment was truly lovely! I booked it for my parents while they were in town and they really enjoyed their stay. The suite was impeccable, beautifully decorated, and in a great neighbourhood - handy to all that Ballard has to offer.  Shannon was great to communicate with, and made the whole process super easy!   Shannon was wonderfully hospitable and accommodating! My flight didn\\'t get in until late that night, but my friend who also stayed at the airbnb was able to meet her earlier in the day to check in and get the key. There was a cute dish of sweets on the kitchen table for us to enjoy when we got there, as well as tea and coffee! Everything was clean, neat and so homey.  Nice spot in an utterly charming neighborhood, and well tooled as a base camp for someone planning to charge up with coffee and breakfast at home, then head out into the world. Don\\'t let the basement factor scare you: There\\'s plenty of natural light and my husband, despite his allergies, had no issues at all. The guestbook is singularly awesome. The fuzzy socks are a must. Overall, great stay! Thanks Shannon! We had a wonderful experience overall, and Shannon was an exceptional host!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment was very clean and nicely updated, and was a good size for two people.  The bed was quite comfortable, and the kitchen was fully stocked if we had wanted to cook at all.  The unit is on the bottom level of the house, and we could hear footsteps from the house above but overall it was very quiet and private. \\r\\n\\r\\nShannon reached out by text soon after our flight landed and was happy to answer questions throughout our stay.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend the apartment to anyone looking to stay in Ballard. The Cozy Hip Vintage MIL was our very first AirBNB experience and thanks Shannon it will not be our last.  First, it is located in the very quaint neighborhood of Ballard where you can walk to breakfast or a coffee shops and enjoy the beautiful neighborhood gardens along the way.  Ballard is close to everything we were looking for and very safe.  The apartment is really cute, well furnished and decorated with a nifty vintage theme.  The kitchen is stocked with coffee, teas, milk, mineral water, butter, etc and best of all I was introduced to my first cup of coffee from a Bialetti, it was great!  She has spent a lot of attention to details which made our experience perfect. Beautiful home, well furnished and extremely comfortable! Shannon was a great host, easily reachable and accommodating to our requests. The neighbourhood is quiet, but near some really good eateries. Highly recommended! Shannon was very helpful and the place was just as described. Very quiet neighborhood but close enough to downtown Ballard as well as a short ride into Fremont, downtown Seattle, etc. Shannon\\'s recommendations were awesome. Thanks! What a delightful place to stay!  I only wish we could have stayed longer!  This is the first time we have used Air BnB and I am sold! I felt so at home from the moment I walked in. Everything we needed was provided. The location was fantastic!  We could walk around nearby to a lot of trendy shops and restaurants and it was only 10-15 minutes to touristy things like Pike Place. I would definitely love to stay here again! Shannon was great. I really enjoyed staying at her place. This place is a treat, located in a great neighborhood, the details and feel of the place make you feel at home. I highly recommend her place if you are visiting. Shannon was the most gracious host with beautiful vintage modern taste. The place was immaculate -- a  perfect, cozy getaway for a couple in dire need of some R & R from work, Los Angeles and a 2-year-old. We made the most of the immediate neighborhood, too: awesome restaurants, shopping, movies and massages. Thank you so, so much.  Great neighborhood, super cute spot. Shannon is a fab hostess. Shannon\\'s apartment was exactly as pictured.  It was clean, comfortable, and very cute.  She goes the extra mile to provide you with great recommendations in the neighborhood and even brought me a iron and ironing board so that I could iron my bridesmaid dress.  The location is convenient to downtown Seattle and close to great neighborhoods, like Ballard and Fremont.  I would definitely stay there again! Nice place and Shannon very helpful/pleasant. Plus, as someone who knows Seattle well I\\'d say staying here is a pretty authentic Seattle experience. Plus, only a few blocks from Honore bakery. Extraordinary croissants. Great stay at Shannon\\'s apartment!\\nThe pictures are nice but the real thing is even better. \\nExceptionally clean, nice and cool in a Seattle heat wave, with everything we needed plus some extras for our stay. Shannon even got us a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon an let us swing by and drop our bags off early. \\nAs a first time air bnb user this definitely made us feel confident in the service. \\nThanks so much shannon! We had a great stay. The apartment was beautiful and clean and cozy, just like Shannon described it. The kitchen amenities as well as the keypad entry were very convenient. The neighborhood was adorable and had many delicious restaurants. We did hear the upstairs neighbors from time to time, as Shannon had mentioned, but we did not find it disruptive. Would love to stay again! Shannon was a great host, she was affable, timely, and highly accommodating. The listing was exactly as advertised--her place was clean and super cozy. The Ballard neighborhood is really cool with lots to do. Shannon\\'s place is within walking distance to many different local attractions. Overall, my girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay. Highly recommended! Shannon\\'s MIL Apt was PERFECT! So much space, great location, and she made us feel welcomed with cute little touches. For instance, she left us some beer, sparkling water, and milk in the fridge, as well as delicious chocolates and caramels. Her itinerary/rental overview has great suggestions for places to check out in the area, and was super straight forward. Ballard Ave has plenty of restaurants and bars to try, and a great community feel. You can tell Shannon has put thought and effort into creating a unique space for guests, and she was a pleasure to interact with. I would 100% recommend to other guests looking for a place to stay.  I had a great stay at Shannon\\'s place.  The apartment was very clean, immaculately organized and bright for a basement apartment.  It has a ridiculously comfy bed and fun touches like little chocolates and a very creative guest book (I loved seeing the entries from previous guests).  Very quiet street, never had any problems parking a rental car right out front.\\r\\nAll my communication with Shannon was answered promptly and there were very clear and convenient instructions for checking in and out. We absolutely loved staying here. The apartment was very comfortable and well designed. It is about a 15-20 min walk to the main Ballard drag, but we didn\\'t mind walking through the very cute neighborhoods. I highly recommend this place! This place is great! The place has a good amount of space and was very clean. It was nice to have a kitchen stocked with the necessities (plates, pots, pans, knives, etc.). Shannon was very friendly and responsive.  Love Ballard and the surrounding neighborhood.  Shannon met us on our arrival and showed us around the property and she remained easily accessible during our entire stay. Though in the \\'basement\\', the unit was quite spacious. The shower-tub were very good as were the bath and bed linens and pillows. We appreciated the many tools and amenities in the kitchen and bathroom that left us wanting for nothing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only shortcoming was the inability to directly control the forced air heating system that is controlled by the thermostat in the upstairs unit. We were never uncomfortable but direct control would be preferred. It should also be noted that there is  no television in the unit. Shannon\\'s MIL is such a comfortable, welcoming, well-appointed space. The decor, furniture, lighting, bed, kitchen, bathroom, linens... all perfect. Really a great bed! I stayed for five days and would gladly have stayed much longer if I needed. The location is walkable to so many good things: wine shops, restaurants, parks, grocery stores. Unlike Old Ballard, the neighborhood is also easily accessible from elsewhere in the city.  Pavel was very welcoming. The room was large and pleasant, and located in a great neighborhood.  Pavel was an excellent host! The place was perfect! Very spacious, clean, comfortable, and private.  Great host.  Made me feel very welcome.  Super clean home and room.  I needed to extend my stay a few times and he was great about it.   Paval was great. We booked within the same week and needed special accommodation for bike storage and odd checking in/out hours. He made this trip very easy and comfortable!  I enjoyed my stay , love  the location . \\nVery nice neighborhood and restaurants close by  Pavel was very welcoming and clearly put effort into making this space comfortable. We really appreciated our stay at Pavel\\'s. He was very accommodating of our wacky schedule and was available for questions. The room is as described - large, clean, well-lit, bathroom in the same area of the basement. The neighborhood was lovely and quiet with some great eating options nearby (we loved Morsel and Bean for breakfast). We were delightfully surprised by Pavel\\'s wonderful book collection which you can see pictured - it was varied, interesting and seemingly personal. Staying at Pavel\\'s felt like staying in the guest room of a kind, neat and intellectual family member. Personable, polite, responsive host.  Clean and comfortable accommodation.  Convenient location. Pavel was friendly and accommodating, as was his cat! :) We had a separate entrance which was nice after coming back from a concert late at night.  Pavel was very welcoming and friendly. He did his best to accommodate me during my stay. The room is as described, large and clean and in a quiet neighbourhood. Staying at Pavels house in ballard was a quiet and pleasant experience. ..the room was neat and airy....with a separate entrance u will find all the privacy u can get but u are also allowed into this apartment upstairs where u can cook or hang out...getting there with the 28 bus takes no time from downtown, sometimes I stopped in Fremont for dinner. ..\\nI would absolutely go back. ... Very clean and large room, Pavel was extremely accommodating and friendly.  A large- well-lit room with a queen bed, desk and secured access. Local sightseeing guides if you need them. Plenty of clean towels with a sink and mini-fridge on the same level. Pavel was a generous host who aims to keep you comfortable throughout your stay. I\\'ll definitely check on availability the next time I need a room in Seattle! House was in a great location. Amazing kitchen area and we felt very welcome. The downstairs carpeted area didn\\'t do so well for our allergies, but overall it was a great experience! The house really is as pretty as pictured, and Sasha left me with everything I needed to have a relaxing stay in Ballard (including restaurant and grocery recommendations). Also the house is a convenient 2 blocks away from the bus stop.  I would recommend staying here if you get the chance. My family enjoyed their 6-day stay at this nice and clean two-story Ballard house. We got everything we need and the location is more convenient than we expected to get to Seattle downtown. The hens in the yard are very cute and provided us fresh eggs everyday. The extra mattress was provided per our request. The host Sasha gave us all the details we need to know before we came. Comparing with 4 people living in hotels for 6 days, the Ballard Home gave you more space and cost much less. Thank you Sasha for everything.  We had a really nice stay here. The house is in a nice, quiet neighborhood. It\\'s a short drive or long walk to downtown Ballard. There are also a few bars and restaurants within a short walk. The layout is one BR, an office, and a bathroom on the first floor, and another BR, bathroom, and the kitchen and living/dining room upstairs. The upstairs is recently remodeled and the kitchen is much bigger than it looks in the photos. Sasha was very easy to get in touch with. She provided a futon mattress to use in the office, which was a nice option for one of my kids, but I wouldn\\'t put an adult on the futon. There\\'s off street parking and a smallish but nice yard.  I had a great time. The house is very spacious, clean, and decorated quite well.  Awesome apartment , great location and this placed served us well for our first trip to Seattle. Thanks again. We had a great experience! Valerie was a great resource - super responsive to questions and provided a lot of helpful information. The place was fantastic and it a great location! Absolutely loved the place! It was very modern, and was large enough to host our group of friends for the weekend. The rooftop deck is beautiful and the view of Seattle was great! We\\'ll definitely be contacting Valerie again if we need a place to host in Seattle. The townhouse is so beautiful! The studio was my favorite room! Valerie is great with communication and gave me all the necessary information and resources I needed for the stay. She also left out little guides about Seattle for places to go and other suggestions. She\\'s a great host! Valerie was awesome and so was her beautiful townhouse. It was very clean and modern, my party and I were very impressed. I would highly recommend staying here. The townhouse was in a great location with many restaurants,shops, and nightlife near by.  Tracy is a sweetheart and her place is a wonderful retreat. You\\'ll be in a cottage style accommodation that is separate from the main house. Tons of privacy and a lot of space. I was so, so happy with it. I will definitely try to stay with Tracy again next time I\\'m in Seattle! Love love love Tracy and her adorable little home away from home! It was quiet, private  and comfortable.  Thanks Tracy! I had a great time staying at Tracy\\'s place!  Arrival was easy and quick with a lock for the key right by the door.  The room is very well appointed--clean, classy-industrial feel.  The shower and bathroom were clean and plenty of linens.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerks: Pour over coffee!!  I loved it!  Thank you for providing that.  And the best part--the bed.  This bed is amazingly comfortable.  In fact, it\\'s one of the most comfy beds I\\'ve ever slept in.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLocation was in the heart of the city--close to everything.  You must try Delancy Pizza down the street--Fantastic pizza and wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would highly recommend staying here and look forward to my next visit. My husband and I had a wonderful time staying at Tracy\\'s cottage. The cottage is just as described and looks even better than in the pictures. You can definitely tell that Tracy spent time getting this place set up. The neighborhood was perfect for what we were looking for. It was in an area where you could easily enjoy the neighborhood perks as well as taking some transit and checking out the city. Tracy was very welcoming and easy to communicate throughout the whole process. She has a lock box to grab the keys for the cottage so checking in and out was very simple. My husband and I also had the opportunity to enjoy a fire with Tracy and a few of her friends which was very nice. It was great to talk to other people who have moved to the area from all over and get their perspective on the city. Overall it was a truly wonderful experience staying at Tracy\\'s cottage and I would definitely recommend others to stay there.  I was really needing a respite from roughing it on my epic road trip. Tracy\\'s cottage was absolutely perfect! It was cozy AND chic at the same time. \\r\\nCheck-in was effortless. Hence, I was immediately able to make myself comfortable with the wonderful shower in the awesome  bathroom and take a nap on the spacious bed before exploring the area. \\r\\nThe things that really stood out to me was the cleanliness and attention to detail (extra towels and linens, coffee and supplies, phone chargers, and info about the area!). And how can I forget her sense of design. I really feel that this one of the aspects I need to feel comfortable in a space. There was no clutter. Just clean lines and lots of cleanliness. Staying here was like something out of a CB2 ad! This was definitely better than staying at a hotel. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the comforts of this place, it turns out that Tracy is a foodie (as I), so she provided some great suggestions for the various local eateries, breweries, bakeries, wine bars, and such. They really helped me when figuring out where to go. \\r\\n\\r\\nThough I did not personally meet Tracy, I definitely felt her warm hospitality. I certainly would not hesitate to stay here again in the future. I even raved about this place to friends as some of them are members of AirBnB. :)\\r\\n My mother and I really enjoyed our stay at the industrial chic ensuite cottage while visiting Seattle. The private cottage separated from the main house was spacious and well stocked with coffee, tea, an assortment of milks, hair dryer, and plenty of towels to name only a few of the many amenities. The bed was extremely comfortable and the blankets were very cozy. The space is very well designed. The furnishings and fixtures come together nicely to create the industrial chic style.\\n\\nCommunication with Tracy was excellent and she was flexible with check-in time, offering key access in a locked box for our late night arrival. The street and neighborhood are in a nice residential area and there is plenty of street parking for those traveling by car. Awesome area and comfy place to stay. Very cool cottage that has everything you need.\\r\\nTracy was gracious and let me stay another night that was unexpected. \\r\\nLoved the area and it was easy to get around with GPS. Tracy\\'s bungalow was a true retreat! The space was just as lovely as it is in the pictures, if not more! Tracy was very communicative, and incredibly nice. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was great to explore the Ballard neighborhood! Everything was extremely seamless. \\r\\n\\r\\nI hope to be able to stay there again on my next visit! The Industrial Chic Cottage was just lovely. It was clean and inviting. The neighborhood felt very safe for walking around. There were small quaint restaurants and bars within walking distance. The best was the French Bakery...try the ham and cheese croissants!  Superb experience! Wonderful and charming cottage. Very cozy.  What a fabulous space! My husband, daughter and I stayed in the cottage for two nights and loved it. It was so thoughtfully designed with lots of added extras. The neighborhood reviews proved helpful come breakfast time, when we were able to walk down the street and choose from a couple highly-recommended spots. I lived in Seattle for over ten years, so I love the hideaway places best! Thanks for a lovely experience! Can\\'t wait to come back!! This house was the perfect little retreat during a visit to Seattle.  It was private, quiet and beautifully decorated.  I really appreciated all the thoughtful touches (tea, coffee, and all the perfect furnishings) that graced this charming little getaway.  Everything was clean and bright and well-appointed. Parking was easy to find on the street and I slept like a baby. I love a no-fuss checkin, and Tracy\\'s process couldn\\'t be easier.  Highly recommended! The cottage is decorated very nicely, with convenient touches such as coffee and tea, and recommendations for nearby shops and restaurants.  There is a very comfortable bed, a great shower, and plenty of closet space.  The location is great for visiting the trendy and chic Ballard neighborhood and Tracy is very friendly.  We definitely will stay here again! Tracy was very helpful in providing options for getting to the cottage and left three pages of good recommendations for food and activities in Ballard and the surrounding neighborhoods. The cottage is exactly as shown in the images and was an extremely comfortable place to stay. The neighborhood is very charming with a few very good restaurants and coffee shops. I would definitely stay here again. Tracy was an amazing host. Great communication and made us feel very welcome. Her place is exactly as advertise (even better IMO)! HIGHLY recommend. Tracy was truly an exceptional host with an incredible cottage that we stayed in.  Everything was extremely transparent from scheduling our stay, to getting the key and making ourselves feel right at home.  Being brand new to the area, we were truly pleased to find that Tracy had left some suggestions to where to eat, which turned out to be great options....Some were even the best food that we had during our stay.  When we go back, the Industrial Chic Ensuite Cottage will be the only place we lay our heads! This chic little cottage was the perfect getaway. From the moment I walked in the front door I felt as if I was coming home. The ambiance and cute decor were warm and welcoming. Tracy left a map and list of local coffee shops, eateries and bars which made it easy when needing a locals inside tip. The neighborhood was super cute and made taking a morning stroll very relaxing and enjoyable. I appreciated the thoughtful touches like the hair dryer, toiletries and an iron! All of which came in handy. I really liked all the windows and natural light too. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone staying in or near Ballard. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for your hospitality :) Tracy was a great host and her cottage was incredible. I\\'m so glad I found a comfortable, super clean, thoughtfully designed and cool spot to spend a few nights while in town for work. The neighborhood is very easy to park, the cottage has privacy being separate from the house, but still just a few steps away from your host should you need anything. Tracy had great communication with me throughout, left helpful suggestions for dining, and her sweet outdoor cat greeted me in the morning. Thanks Tracy, what a great spot you created there! Tastefully and comfortably decorated, and immaculately clean. It felt like we were staying in a one-room boutique hotel. \\r\\n\\r\\nNeighborhood is really cute, too - we loved getting breakfast at the Fat Hen (pleasant walk away), dinner at Brimmer & Heeltap (short bus ride), pizza at Delancey (walk) and cocktails at its awesome adjoining bar Essex!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Tracy is my wife\\'s new design guru! Every element of the space was carefully thought out. It felt like a modern, luxurious hotel room. Supplies were well stocked and she was her own maitre\\'d providing a detailed list of places to go eat, drink and be merry. We were in Seattle for a wedding close by this cottage (the Zoo!)  This was the perfect spot to get easily everywhere we needed to be.  The decor is gorgeous, it is equipped with everything you would need and was quiet and private.  I highly recommend it!!! We arrived late, and getting into our cozy quarters was set up so as to be a snap. Tracy is a fabulous hostess. She respected our privacy. She discreetly inquired about any needs we might have, and met them in a flash. She could not have been more welcoming, personable, or cheerful. \\r\\nThe neighborhood, Ballard, can only be described as a pedestrian-and-family-friendly American classic. Sidewalks are everywhere. People are unbelievably friendly, and interesting. Neighborhood eateries abound within walking distance. Public transportation into the city is convenient. We will be repeat customers. Thank-you, Tracy!  --Janet & Robert, Chicago  Tracy had great correspondence with us prior to and during our arrival and stay, and she met all of our needs and more.  She left us a list of things to do and see, and there was plenty of coffee!  The location was ideal, the neighborhood was delightful, and the accommodations were perfect.  She\\'s made the cottage a most enjoyable memory of a special weekend in Seattle. Our first Airbnb trip was wonderful - we\\'ll definitely do it again, and we highly recommend her cottage to future guests.   The cottage was great and everything was super easy and accommodating. The location was convenient for our trip and still out of the way enough to be quiet and private. Tracy has thought of everything for the cottage and I would recommend it to anyone.   Tracy was the best experience we\\'ve ever had with AirBnb. She went above and beyond and worked with our schedule for a crazy weekend that we had. We would recommend her and her cute little place to everyone who wants to visit Seattle.  This is a wonderful place to stay. The description and pictures were completely accurate, and Tracy answered all our questions promptly. She greeted us after we arrived and did everything she coukd to make us feel welcome.     The cottage is beautiful and very comfortable.  Many amenities not listed were provided such as; a hair drier, iron and ironing board, and wine opener, shampoo and toothpaste. I loved the industrial chic decor, and the bed was very comfortable with very nice bedding.  We walked to dinner and drinks on two of the nights, and breakfast one day.  It was nice to be within walking distance of so many great places. Tracy was out of town, but responded quickly to any  correspondence from us via text.  We will definitely stay here again! Great place, quiet residential neighborhood, not too far from lots of nice spots on the north side of the city. Probably not the best spot for someone looking for a bustling urban experience, but a great base for exploring Ballard, Greenlake, Phinney Ridge, Wallingford, Fremont. \\r\\n\\r\\nStudio is cozy, clean, extremely comfortable. Private and tucked away. We loved staying at this adorable studio.  The space was exactly as depicted in the listing- very modern and cozy.  Tracy\\'s cottage appears to be a re-purposed portion of a garage.  It was designed beautifully, but was a bit cold given the concrete floors and wooden ceiling with no insulation.  This was our first trip to Seattle, so we were out exploring most of our trip.  The neighborhood is very residential and public transit in Seattle is not the best, and because we didn\\'t have a car, we took Ubers to most places.  We would stay here again! Tracy was a charming host and treated us to OJ and sparkling wine, very nice on the holidays. The cottage is charming, clean, quiet and comfortable. And the neighborhood is up and coming Ballard trendy, very fun. Ellen came and checked on us the first couple of nights to make sure we had everything we needed. When we couldn\\'t get the TV to work she offered to let us use her DVD player and movies if we wanted. The space is a good size room, a private bathroom and a kitchen/walkthrough area. We had broken our french press recently and Ellen let us use one while we were there. The space has a refrigerator, a microwave, hot water pot and an Elite electric cookpot. I was able to use the cookpot to make soup one night and steam my manapua another night. Ellen also gave us use of the back porch and saved me once by feeding my husband when I thought I would get home in enough time to make him something to eat before he needed to go to an appointment. He was still talking about the salad she made two days later. Ellen was a great host and the space was just what we wanted. We would stay there again, definitely recommended. My wife and I stayed at Ellen\\'s place while we were house-hunting prior to relocating to Seattle. She helped us figure out public transportation to and from the airport.  Her place is only five minutes to an express bus which connects to the train downtown. (about an hour and a half to the airport from Ballard)\\r\\n\\r\\nEllen is a great host, very warm and easy-going. She even baked us tasty muffins and cookies, in addition to having a great kitchenette set-up for morning coffee. (complete with condiments, tasty chocolates, oatmeal, french press and plenty of dishes)\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Ellen! Our stay in Seattle was greatly enhanced by the hospitality offered by Ellen.  She is a gracious host who is both helpful and accommodating.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The private entrance allowed us to come and go as we pleased.  Ellen even shared some of her baked goodies with us.  We will miss Ellen\\'s easy-going manner that made us feel right at home.  Ballard is an interesting neighborhood with some good restaurants and shops.  Worth a visit for sure. It was nice to stay at the Ballard room hosted by Ellen.\\r\\nI found there more than really what I was needed for during my staying.\\r\\nCoffee in the morning, refrigerator et.\\r\\nThere was also a TV in the room with games, but never had the time to turn it on.\\r\\nThe sweetest thing was she offered and dropped me off both days to my Feng Shui lecture, so I\\'m really appropritiated for that. Ellen was a lovely host and her place had everything we needed. We didn\\'t spend much time at her home during the day, but we did have comfortable sleeps on the futon. The laundry was a bonus as well as Ellen\\'s friendly dog Jasper and curious cat, Alfie.   Ellen was a wonderful host. The room has a lot of space. I found it peaceful and quiet which helped me get some rest and work done. The desk was a plus. She checked on me during my stay to make sure I was comfortable and was always a delight to talk to. Before I left in the morning, she came down and gave me some delicious cookies that went perfectly with my coffee on my way to school. Nice calm and cozy neighborhood with everything nearby within walking distance too. Ellen was a great host. She checked on me few times and even invited me to have dinner with her family and friends upstairs. The room was excellent. I was out most of the time, but when I got back to the house I found myself very relaxed due to the fact that it\\'s quite and peaceful being in there. 5 stars!  Ellen was very accommodating in arranging a time for me to get a key to the house.  The rooms were as described - clean, airy, convenient and private.  I also enjoyed the opportunity I had to talk with Ellen briefly.  She was relaxed, comfortable and interesting - all traits I value! Ellen\\'s space is large but a bit dark. It served my purpose, though, and I enjoyed the cat\\'s and dog\\'s company at times. Ellen was a great host and I would stay there again. The neighborhood is great, close to bus lines into town and within walking distance (15-20 min) to the many restaurants in Ballard. (I tried to give this five stars, but the web site seems to be having problems.) Ellen\\'s basement apartment was spacious and comfortable. Ellen was also very accomodating when our flight was severely delayed, which caused us to arrive late at night.  My girlfriend and I stayed with Ellen for five days and had a fantastic time in Seattle.  Ellen was kind, helpful and accommodating whenever we needed help.  She is a sincerely gracious host and we would recommend this home to anyone. Ellen was a wonderful host and the room was great with enough privacy to feel like we were in our own hotel suite! Ellen is very gracious and accommodating and even made us cookies :).  I\\'d recommend Ellen\\'s place to anyone, and if I ever make it back to Seattle, I will be sure to give Ellen a call! Ellen was a wonderful host! My sister and I stayed with her while we were in town and loved having the room as a home base. Ellen was very accommodating of our (increasingly complicated) travel schedule on the way in and made us some delicious treats in the mornings.    My wife and I had a great time staying with Ellen for a week. She was very accommodating and even made us some cookies and a cake. The room was very spacious and affordable. It was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay. I did find an unexpected guest sleeping in my bed since I forgot to close the door to the bedroom, but he is nice dog and it wasn\\'t a big deal. Thanks again for everything. I booked this room for my mother who was visiting from Arkansas. The space was very clean and exactly as advertised. My mom kept commenting to me that, \"Ellen thought of everything!\" \\r\\n\\r\\nShe was very pleased with the accommodations to say the least. It was very quiet and things like a fridge, tea kettle, and use of the washer and dryer were features that made this much nicer than staying at a hotel. Plus the back deck is perfect for relaxing outside. I\\'ll be recommending this place to all of our out-of-town visitors.  Overall a great experience and a great value for the price. Ellen was very nice - she even gave me some homemade cookies!  The room was clean and comfortable.  I\\'m a big guy so I found the shower head a little low for me and the stall a little narrow.  A hand-held shower head would be a welcome addition.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bed is a futon with a foam topper.  I found it very comfortable, but it is firm like any futon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location was perfect for me as I was visiting a relative in Ballard.  Parking on the street was easy to find within a door or two of the house.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Seattle. Ellen is a kind, generous, and thoughtful host. As someone who just moved to town, I appreciated her friendliness and helpful suggestions. Her home is in a very pleasant neighborhood and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The space is clean and cozy – I happily thought of it as \"home\" while I checked out housing around the city. Her pets Alfie and Jasper are gentle and sure to make you smile. Thanks for great stay, Ellen! You will enjoy staying at Ellen\\'s as she is considerate, helpful, and calm.  Ellen\\'s home is conveniently located in a great neighborhood.  I walked all over and also used the Rapid D line for easy bus access to Ballard and downtown.  There is easy street parking, too.  The two room basement  area is welcoming and nicely arranged, it suited the work I wanted to do when I was home..  I especially appreciated my own entrance and bathroom, ensuring privacy.  I also enjoyed sharing with Ellen and the tasty,  healthy treats she prepared. Ellen was a great host and the space was good match for what I needed in terms of being new to town and needing time to find an apartment. Ellen was accommodating and generous! She even shared various homemade snacks with me! I\\'d say this is a good place to stay if you\\'re in need of a a bit more space and need access to a kitchen.  I spent a month at Ellen\\'s place, and I couldn\\'t have been happier. It\\'s a very clean, simple, and private suite in a great area, close to a number of beautiful parks as well as the center of Ballard. And with an easy 30 minute commute downtown with the new RapidRide bus line a couple blocks away, it\\'s very accessible to the rest of the city. The back entrance makes it easy to come and go without disturbing, but Ellen was always fun to chat with when we crossed paths, and had a lot of tips about the area. Also, having a washer/dryer so readily available in the space was super nice! I very much enjoyed my stay with Ellen.  She makes every effort to ensure comfort; the neighborhood is quiet.  The space was just what I needed for my 5 day stay.  I plan to return soon. The downstairs mini-apartment has served my needs on both visits and Ellen has been a very accommodating hostess.  This residential area is quiet and with easy access to bus routes or to drive downtown or over to the water.  I would definitely return! Ellen\\'s space was the perfect getaway for our weekend stay in Seattle! The amenities were exactly as listed, Ellen was great to communicate about arrangements for getting into the space and everything was clean and tidy! Thanks Ellen- we\\'ll definitely be contacting you the next time we visit Seattle! This was a very nice first experience with Airbnb. Ellen\\'s place was just as advertised, and though our schedules did not match and we did not meet, she was good at communicating by text and all went smoothly. The place was clean and peaceful and the mattress was comfortable. Only a little confusion because I arrived int he evening and couldn\\'t see or find the house number. I deduced it from the neighboring numbers.  Ellen made us fill right at home. Her place is beautiful. private and clean. Her back yard is quite and a wonderful relaxing point. We strongly recommend staying at her lovely home.  Ellen\\'s location in NW Ballard is a great spot! Easy accessibility to downtown Seattle and a great neighbourhood to be in. I really appreciated the fact that we had our own private space. When we arrived, we were greeted with a welcome note from Ellen, telling us of the great hot spots for food. Thai, Vietnamese, Mexican and Western cuisine; I\\'m sure there were more on that list, but I can\\'t quite remember them all. She knew of all the great little boutiques around town and was kind enough to give us directions should we need it. Her place was clean and comfortable, especially for a Queen size futon bed. This was so much better than a hotel stay, as we had our own full kitchen, bathroom and private bedroom. We were able to meet Ellen and on our last day in Seattle and she offered us to come up to her home and surprised us with delicious homemade muffins. I would definitely recommend staying with Ellen. I\\'m sure we will be back for another visit!  Great first experience with Airbnb! Ellen was very nice and easy to check in with via email. She wasn\\'t going to be home when we arrived but she made it easy for us to get the key and let ourselves in. The direct entrance to the apartment was perfect for coming & going and not feeling like we were bothering anyone. Overall the space is calm, and although in a basement, it felt bright. The neighborhood is nice for taking a walk, with restaurants, parks, & transit all nearby. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing that wasn\\'t a problem for us, but may bother light sleepers, is that you can hear footsteps from the room above. Anyone who is used to living in a bottom floor apartment won\\'t have a problem.   We had a wonderful time in Seattle and one of the best things about it was staying with Ellen. The little downstairs suite was just as advertised, clean and cozy. The mini-fridge, microwave and toaster oven in the kitchen space was all we needed for meals and holding leftovers (so many delicious restaurants in Seattle!). The house was fairly quiet and nicely relaxing for the times we just felt like sleeping in. The separate entrance was a big perk, as we didn\\'t feel intrusive in coming and going as we pleased. Ellen was a welcoming host, giving us a little primer on the area before leaving us to our own devices. She was always open to answering questions and suggesting specific places and was very communicative. We enjoyed the Ballard area quite a bit. The neighborhood is two blocks away from the D Line, which was a very convenient way to get downtown and to the other main transit lines. Ballard was nice to walk around in too; walking 15 minutes south from the house will take you to the busy district of Ballard, with shops, restaurants, coffeehouses and a record shop. We would absolutely stay here again the next time we visit Seattle. Thanks, Ellen! Ellen is the epitome of a gracious, kind, calm, sweet, and thoughtful host.  I had a wonderful and hassle-free two-week stay at her home in Ballard.  She went out of her way to make my stay as comfortable as possible, providing delicious healthy snacks (homemade blueberry muffins made with agave and chocolate chip cookies).  I also really enjoyed the conversations that I had with her and her family.  This being my first visit to Seattle, Ellen answered all my questions about the city, and even connected me to her previous tenants who knew of possible openings for additional short-term housing, as I was considering a potential cross-country move.  Being foodies, she and her family also recommended more than 30+ restaurants (many of them vegetarian) and coffeehouses to try, which I really, really appreciated.  :)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house itself is conveniently located to public transportation (the Rapid-D line bus was able to take me downtown fairly quickly), and is a short stroll away from Ballard\\'s delights.  I enjoyed walking in the neighborhood, which includes a Sunday Farmer\\'s Market, and Market Street, which has a lot of great eateries.  Sometimes I would even pop into the Ballard library for free-wifi, although the house is also equipped with free-wifi.  I also liked the capacious space a lot; it was really convenient to have a nice, private room with a separate bathroom and a small kitchen to use, as well as a separate entrance.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI loved my stay, and Ellen\\'s warm hospitality.  Thank you so much! Ellen provides a nice \"home-away-from-home\" to those visiting Seattle, and in particular, the Ballard neighborhood.  Everything I needed was thoughtfully provided.  The futon bed was comfortable and the mini-kitchenette met my needs.  I\\'m familiar with the neighborhood and didn\\'t need any help with what to do or how to get around but I\\'m sure Ellen is happy to provide assistance to those that need information.   joli petit appartement, simple mais fonctionnel . Ideal comme pieds à terre pour 2 personnes pour visiter Seattle. L\\'hôtesse est accueillante et attentionnée.\\r\\nSi l\\'occasion se présente, nous reviendrons avec plaisir. Staying at Ellen\\'s was perfect for us. It was very clean and the space was comfortable and more than ample for 2. The neighborhood is quiet and the parking was very easy. We enjoyed the privacy of having our own access to the flat and appreciated the little touches...like fresh ground coffee in the refrigerator.\\r\\nIt really felt like a lot of consideration was given to what would make a comfortable stay for guests. Luggage could be stowed at waist level behind lovely curtains. The bed was comfortable and the shower was hot with good pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe backyard was inviting though the weather was not conducive this trip. Ellen\\'s place is in a very pretty part of Seattle, and the house itself is really nice. We were comfortable during our entire trip. Definitely stay here if you\\'re coming to Seattle! Ellen wasn\\'t around for our stay, but her daughter, Tara, was there. She was very accommodating by allowing us to check-in very late due to flight times. The room was just as advertised and very cosy. It is a home away from home. The pets are sweet and friendly, and will visit with you if you want. The neighborhood is absolutely convenient, with nearby groceries, sundries, shops, and sites. I would definitely stay here upon my return to Seattle. Ellen was extremely mindful of giving her guests their space and privacy. She has a very calm presence and is always thinking of new places for her guests to go out and see. I was always comfortable asking her questions or sending her a text when she wasn\\'t around in-person. And the rest of the reviews are true when they say she can whip up some delicious treats - I had some great crepes with almond butter and bananas with her on my first and last mornings in Seattle(along with some good conversations). A great way to begin and end the trip! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe space itself is spacious, and with a private sink, bathroom, microwave, toaster, and coffee maker. It really feels like your own little apartment. I loved the surrounding area - quiet, near some beautiful parks and near some stunning views of the olympic mountains. The place removed from the bustle of the city, but well-connected to buses that take you directly to downtown. If you don\\'t venture out, then Ballard itself is an adorable neighborhood complete with everything you\\'d need.  The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting. . Perfect stay!    We loved it and would definitely stay here again.   Loved that it had a separate entrance so we could come and go without disturbing Ellen.  Thanks again Ellen!   Ellen\\'s guest space is simple but clean and provided a good home base while we were out looking for apartments. She was very sweet to let our dog out into the backyard and spend time upstairs when we were gone for longer days. We enjoyed getting to know the surrounding area--many great restaurants nearby and pleasant residential streets for taking a stroll. This is the second time I have stayed with Ellen.  She is a wonderful host with a clean, comfy and perfectly located rental.  Ellen is very kind and always went out of her way to make me feel welcomed.  Whenever I told her of my plans to explore Seattle she always had a mountain of advise on how to go about doing it the most fun, inexpensive and easy way.  The rental itself is great!  Extremely clean and quiet.  The backyard is also great to enjoy the nice evenings in Seattle.  I highly recommend this rental to anyone! Thanks Ellen provided the comfortable place for our staying. Room guide really helps us for dinner (website hidden). Rainier is very very beautiful. Next time, hope we can hike in the mountain together. Thank you~ Ellen’s place was a great spot for my trip to Seattle. It was easy to find and orient myself to the space, excellent location and very close to a favorite restaurant of mine, Cafe Munir. Ellen’s warm and laid back atmosphere that she created was very much appreciated!  Nice and quiet stay, neighborhood makes it easy to get to downtown Seattle & surrounding areas. Loved the \"private\" entrance. I enjoyed my stay at Ellen\\'s house. She was a great host. There was plenty of space to spread out and feel comfortable. The neighborhood is nice and I enjoyed both walking down to Ballard and the option of catching a bus to downtown Seattle just a few blocks away. I slept well all week long.\\r\\n Ellen\\'s place fit our needs well. Ellen is a thoughtful hostess and true animal lover. Her place was clean, the bed was comfortable, and location was close to some great shops and resturants. Finding a comfortable and affordable place to stay with a pet is not always easy. Ellen\\'s place worked out well. We appreciate her hospitality :) Ellen\\'s place was wonderful for my extended stay in Seattle.  The cozy, clean and comfortable room was more than enough for one person and I really liked the kitchenette and private bath and private entrance.  The neighborhood was quiet and great for walking.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a great combination of privacy and sociability, Ellen made me feel at home and shared conversations and delicious homemade treats that were much appreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy stay was a wonderful experience!\\r\\n Ellen is a wonderful host. She gave me clear and complete directions about the house. Written directions and hints were actually placed around the house as well which was smart and helpful to me.\\r\\nEverything was just as described, clean/renovated and lovely. Internet with good bandwidth and stability. Dishes, excellent washer/drier, appliances were available. \\r\\nThe room is in the basement, fully isolated.  The laundry is shared, but Ellen didn\\'t want to use it even when I told her its completely OK, since I sleep like a rock :)\\r\\nQuite, almost serene neighborhood. I rested so well.. and it was something about the air: my allergies disappeared during this stay.. Will definitely stay there again. This was my first AirBnB experience. Ellen greeted me when I got there. She showed me my room, the amenities and maps. She had coffee, tea and fruit for my use, as well as odds and end things in the fridge. It felt very welcoming. The space was perfect for my dogs and I. I loved the deck in the backyard.  Ellen is a wonderful hostess. Ellen was a wonderful host. She was very helpful as a guide in telling about specific areas of Seattle. While I only stayed for a short time, she made me feel welcome in her home and her city.  I stayed with Ellen for a month while I was working in Seattle and I had a great experience. The room was exactly as advertised - clean and very convenient. Ellen was great with my dog and often took him out while I was at work. Her and her daughter were quiet and easy to live with. The area was convenient and safe. I would highly recommend staying with Ellen for a short or long-term stay in Seattle! I\\'m happy to report that my first experience renting just a room (as opposed to a whole unit) was a great success! First, Ellen started the trip off on a positive note by accommodating my late check-in. The space was very neat & tidy and although I was traveling alone, it could easily be used by a couple. While I had minimal face-to-face interaction with Ellen and did not have any need to contact her while I was there, I felt that she was just an easy call or text away any time I may have needed something. Also, the location is excellent. Ample parking, an easy drive to downtown (even during rush hour), walking distance to some cool bars/restaurants, and I also made use of the nearby bus lines. I had a wonderful stay at Ellen\\'s home. It was very peaceful, quiet, and private. I enjoyed our conversations and the hospitality. I was very happy to stay in Ballard with Ellen. Thanks! Ellen was a very kind host to us and our dog. The space is a very comfortable private floor of their house, with a bedroom and separate kitchen, as well as a private bath. The memory foam mattress is also very comfortable. Parking is also ample on the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is excellent, and very convenient to Ballard/Freemont/Green Lake/U-District. We really enjoyed our stay, and definitely recommend this place.  Best Seattle stay I have had. Great location. North on 15th Ave takes right to Northgate Mall. South on 15th Ave goes to Elliott then left on to Denny and South Lake Union or into downtown. Go straight into Western and you can get to the stadiums.\\nI liked the privacy and loved having the laundry. Relaxing location to enjoy Seattle. We had a great time during our stay in Ballard at Ellen\\'s house. Ellen made the whole process incredibly easy. The neighborhood was great and close to all of the restaurants and bars in Ballard. Ellen was very nice and even shared some of her Thanksgiving treats with us! The space looked exactly the photos. Very clean and no carpet which is always appreciated. Our hostess was friendly and welcoming. The kitchenette was also much appreciated! It should be noted that footsteps upstairs are quite noisy downstairs (in the rented space) and a person with cat allergies can have some issue. The major deal breaker for us however was the bed. I like firm beds, but this was too much - we ended up getting a hotel for the last night. Overall the space is friendly, safe and clean, so if you have a dog I\\'m sure it is one of your better options! Ellen was communicative and helpful before my visit about how to get around and was available on my arrival. (a good thing as I had no idea where I was going!). The  apartment was exactly as described and perfect for me. I was looking for privacy, quiet, clean & price. The private bathroom is small but works perfectly. The place is simply furnished and very clean. The firm, memory foam mattress was a draw for me and it did not disappoint. There\\'s a big TV but I never turned it on. I rely on wifi and the network was fast and reliable. The weather was cold during my stay - upper 20\\'s lower 30\\'s at night. Though the apartment was warm enough, there was a space heater in case. I was very comfortable and happy with the place for a week long stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is quiet, not a lot going on. It is about a 20 minute walk to Ballard and all the restaurants & shops which is a great thing to do. You do have to take a bus to downtown (about 30 minutes) for the touristy stuff which is fine for me; I tend to head out in the morning and not return until my day is done. There\\'s a 24hour Safeway and a Walgreens about 5 or 10 minute walk away, at a major intersection of buses.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\\'t rent a car, although I\\'d initially hoped to drive out to the mountains, so I can\\'t comment on parking. But the bus system is amazing. There are many great places within walking distance like Green Lake, Woodland Park and Golden Gardens, not to mention Ballard. The views are spectacular!\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a great time visiting Seattle and this house provided a perfect home base. Ellen was friendly and considerate and the house was exactly what I was looking for. Ellen was a great host and was easily accessible by texting and phone.  She was flexible with arrival and departure times.  The space was exactly as pictured.  Simple,  but spacious and nice and clean.  Having a large, new washer and dryer was especially helpful for a stay of a week+.  The location was perfect for me, and a great value for the price.  I had a rental car and could always find a parking place on the street right in front of the house. Very great neighborhood to park a car. Cute house.  We really enjoyed our stay with Ellen. Very gracious host. Our schedules kept us very busy so we didn\\'t see her a lot,but she was happy to talk when we were available but also happy to leave us be when we were busy.  The room looks just like the picture.  She bakes great cookies! Ellen is a gracious host. She was available for information about the area, and made breakfast on my first morning there. The apartment is private and quiet. Kitchen was well equiped. It had everything I needed. The bed is very comfortable, so I slept well, and It was quiet at night. The neighborhood is good, close to restaurants and shops, and there was always parking out front. I would stay here again, and would recommend it if you are looking for a place to stay in Ballard.  This was our first experience with Airbnb and I have to say it was a great one. The room was exactly as pictured. The room was simple but clean and comfortable.  I don\\'t mind simple, I mind functionality. The kitchenette was my favorite. The room has a great little toaster that made eating grocery food easier. The bed was firm, but comfortable. Ellen recommended a great place for breakfast upon our arrival and it was delicious. I was happy to get my tourist experience during the day and come back to what felt like home.  The neighborhood is just adorable. I really enjoyed seeing everyone\\'s front yards!  Ellen was very accommodating and always made sure we had everything we needed. The space was the perfect size for us and the fact that there was a dog door and I could have my dog with me was great! Location was awesome as well, parking always available.  Private, spacious suite. We chose this one because of the location, dog-friendliness, and garden/patio access and it met expectations. Quiet neighborhood but easy access to Ballard and Phinney Ridge. Plenty of street parking. Also nice to be able to do laundry during an extended stay. All around another good Airbnb experience!  This space is wonderful - A nice, private getaway in a beautiful neighborhood in Ballard. Ellen was a gracious host and welcomed us, showed us the room and its little quirks, and offered tips on vegetarian dining near the neighborhood - a big plus for me. The room has a private entrance in Ellen\\'s backyard, with a lit pathway around the side of her home. My boyfriend and I were free to come and go as we pleased without disturbing anyone. The bedroom portion of the room is separated from the kitchenette and bathroom areas, which I enjoyed. The bed is firm but comfortable, and the blankets that were supplied kept me nice and warm. The kitchenette portion was so nice to be able to use, and I enjoyed the little snacks and beverages Ellen supplied. The shower in the bathroom is small, but it was great to have our own private bathroom to freshen up in. This space was exactly what my boyfriend and I needed as a \\'home base\\' to explore the city and job hunt! Ellen is a very friendly and communicative host. She addressed whatever problems I had (I had a small one) as soon as she could and even offered/gave me a ride to my next destination. The ginger cookies were a nice bonus, too. The host is wonderful, Ellen was very considerate and she even surprised me by offering me a meal (spring roll and Thai green curry) which I really appreciated. I stayed at her place for 15 days and the room is comfortable for long term stay. I had a lot of privacy which is important for me and I had everything I needed. I feel really safe staying at her place. Ballard is a beautiful neighborhood and the public transportation from Ellen\\'s place is amazing. There are buses close to her house that can take me to Greenlake, Downtown, U-District, Golden Garden Park and Northgate mall very easily. I have to say that Ballard is becoming one of my favorite places in Seattle, there are so many cute local shops and restaurants. I really recommend people new to Seattle to stay in Ballard.  We really enjoyed staying at Ellen\\'s place. She was very accommodating even though we arrived quite late at night, and she even offered to make us something to eat from her own kitchen.\\n\\nThe room itself was perfect. Even though the bed is technically a futon, we had completely forgotten this because it was so comfortable. There was a washing machine and tumble dryer in the room which was a great bonus. The coffee and tea provided made for a great start to the day. \\n\\nWe hired a car for one day and there was no problem with on-street parking right outside the house. \\n\\n5 minutes walk from the house was the bus stop for the rapid ride which connects you downtown in about 20 minutes.\\n\\nOverall, we couldn\\'t have been happier staying in Ellen\\'s accommodation. Lovely, quiet place. It was very comfortable and everything we needed. The accommodations were great, and the efficient use of space allowed us to spread out and get comfortable. Ellen was very easy to talk to and helpful, and some of her suggestions on places to see in Seattle ended up being the highlights of our vacation.  Ellen is an excellent host, welcoming and helpful in providing information. The space is just as advertised (actually, a bit larger than I expected, which is not usually the case) and very well-appointed to meet the traveler\\'s needs. There\\'s also a lovely patio and yard out back.\\r\\nEllen\\'s space is located in a sweet Ballard neighborhood. I\\'m looking forward to staying here again when I return to Seattle. Ellen\\'s place is perfect as a temporary housing. It has everything you need to stay, and I enjoyed the privacy of having the whole basement and private bath and kitchenette. The location is great, too.  Ellen was a very gracious host who provided everything we needed for a 5-day visit in Seattle. The location is great – a short drive or bus ride to downtown Seattle, but in a very quiet residential neighborhood with plenty of good food and other things to do nearby. The space is comfortable and it\\'s a great price for the location. We very much enjoyed having morning coffee on the back patio to start each day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe washer & dryer were also very convenient, especially considering that we stayed for more than just a couple days and were pretty active in the warm Seattle sun (not sarcasm, it was actually warm & sunny the whole time).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe private space is a technically a basement and you can hear Ellen doing her normal living stuff upstairs. This is not a big deal if you wake up early, but you may want to ask her about her schedule if you\\'re a light sleeper and hoping to sleep in. She was very responsive to all my messages before and during our visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\'re looking for an affordable place to stay near the heart of Seattle with a gracious host, you can\\'t go wrong here. Ellen made sure I was taken care of when I had to get to places, but she was respectful of my space as well. The description of the place was completely accurate. The neighborhood offers a lot of nice options, both window shopping and eating alone or with friends. It\\'s close to nature at discovery park and the Ballard locks and has the farmers market on Sundays.  -Location is about a 15 min drive to the city. Super close. Also close to a variety of good eateries.\\n-Easy accessible private entry way for her guests. \\n-The space Ellen provided my boyfriend & I was a nicely renovated basement ( a lot bigger space than I imagined it would be) which included a washer/ dryer, our own little kitchen which included a sink, (dishes, cups & utensils which were actually really useful)& a  microwave/ toaster (perfect for leftovers that we had & we never had to bother her). + a private bathroom with a shower. Basically all the necessities we needed to accommodate our stay.\\n- The room was just as pictured,& as other reviews had said the bed was really big/ cozy (especially since I have a futon myself & I think her bed was even more comfortable than mine)\\n-We stayed for about 4 nights & I\\'d have to say that our stay was really comfortable, as if we were right at home. \\n-Ellen was sweet enough to bake us a pastry before we left! (Thanks again btw!!) She also was easy to communicate with & was helpful by all the recommendations she gave us. \\n-I would definitely stay here again if I\\'m every in Seattle or recommend this space to a friend! Ellen is a great host. She welcomed us with healthy drinks and snacks and provided a customized list of restaurant and park/hiking recommendations. The house is adorable and the space downstairs is well-maintained and had everything we needed for our 3-day stay. We loved the Ballard neighborhood and would definitely stay here again! Ellen was very welcoming and even gave my mom and I some delicious zucchini muffins upon arrival. The room is a sweet deal, you get a private bathroom, mini fridge, washer and dryer, TV with Roku, and a private entrance. \\r\\nThe house is beautiful! But the yard could use some love.\\r\\nThe room is below the main house, so make sure you\\'re okay with noise during the day, because Ellen likes to host her private bowling and tap dancing lessons. She really knows how to knock down all of the pins over and over again. I would\\'ve partaken, but I didn\\'t realize wearing combat boots were a requirement.\\r\\nShe also owns a really cute cat. Unfortunately I\\'m allergic, so it wasn\\'t a problem until I woke up to a cat walking on my face one morning. \\r\\nBut overall, my mom and I really enjoyed staying at her house. It was a great price for what we got, and in a really great neighborhood. You can walk a couple blocks to get to 15th to access busses/grocery stores/etc.\\r\\nHighly recommended!  Ellen\\'s place is nice and relaxing and very comfortable. Easy access with a separate entrance and nice backyard.  The location is just north of Ballard and close to the sound. Cute and quaint neighborhood. Ellen is nice, easy going, and helpful. I\\'d recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area. This was a wonderful space in a terrific, centrally located (but peaceful and quiet) neighborhood -- Ballard.  Ellen\\'s basement en suite was clean and it had everything I required for my 5-day trip, including access to a washer and dryer, if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was able to provide my own groceries for the small meals I was providing for myself and the kitchenette was amply stocked.  She also offered up use of her full kitchen, if needed.  (Vegetarian cooking preferred, as noted in her guest manual.)\\r\\n\\r\\nEllen was accessible when needed and was kind and hospitable -- sharing breakfast with me one morning and providing delicious scones on another.  She is great!  I would stay here again in a heartbeat and would definitely recommend it to other travelers. Great location, close to everything if you have a car. No traffic problems on the way to/from the house. The house is beautiful. Make sure you spend some time in the backyard. Yes, the description was accurate of the bedroom. In addition, this is a roomy private suite with shower, washer, dryer and private entry in a quiet neighborhood yet close to great restaurants and Chittendon Locks. With her helpful information of places to eat and places to see we adjusted our itinerary and had an even greater time.  Ellen greeted us when we pulled up. She showed us the private entrance and the back yard. She had a map on the wall of the area and a list of interesting places to experience. Ellen was very down to earth and easy to chat with. She made every effort to make our stay comfortable. Ellen was a fantastic host who made our first airbnb a great one. She provided us great suggestions for where to go and what to do, including great local breweries and dog park/beach. Ellen was really friendly while still giving us our space. The place was just as described with easy access and parking. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great stay in the Ballard district. Ellen was a great host! she introduced herself on the day we checked in and was helpful in telling us a bit about the Ballard area. we were out and about a majority of the time, but Ellen\\'s place was awesome to come back to at the end of our days. definitely recommend staying here as its just a short drive to downtown Seattle, the beach, the waterfront, the snoqualmie area, and if you\\'re up for it like we were Mt. Rainer national park! Would definitely stay again! Ellen was very sweet and inviting. She even  made an extra pear crumble my first night in and it was delicious!!  She also made me a great breakfast the first Saturday I was there and was very helpful about telling me where things were and how to get around.  The room was exaclty like the pictures, very comfortable and perfect for my two week stay. Thanks Ellen!!  Ellen was a fantastic host. She provided me with great recommendations of things to do and of places to eat. Ellen was also very generous with sharing her baked goods. The location is perfect. It is within walking distance of shops, parks and the bus line for downtown is just around the corner. The space was great, a large bedroom with your own bathroom and kitchenette. The washer and dryer was conveniently located just outside the bedroom which was very helpful and the space had its own entrance. Ballard is a amazing neighborhood with unique shops, tasty food and plenty of parking.  Ellen was a wonderful host! She greeted my husband and I with muffins and gave us suggestions on where to eat near her place. The Internet connection was a little spotty, but that could have been a temporary issue. Overall, it was a very comfortable stay!  Jean\\'s house is beautiful and it was big enough for us three men during our stay. The living room with the typical American kitchen is georgeous. Jean is very friendly and a good host. The house is located in a very beautiful part of Seattle. A Ballard Blessing!!!!  What a wonderful place to host our family with room for everyone right in our own neighborhood.  Fully stocked kitchen and darling Ikea decor made it a pleasurable stay.  Plus it has the most amazing view of Mt. Rainier I\\'ve ever seen outside the Space Needle.  You\\'ll also enjoy the courtyard out back.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat location, right on the D-line bus to get you downtown.  An Enterprise Rent-a-Car is also just up the road.  Much within walking distance including Honore Bakery, Delancy Pizza, El Camion (Mexican) and Top Banana Fruit Stand. Don\\'t miss Scandinavian Specialties too for a taste of the local culture.  Sunday Farmer\\'s Market also a must-do.  An indoor city swimming pool is across the street as well as a running track.\\r\\n\\r\\nParking can be an issue but we only had one night when we didn\\'t get a street spot.  There is a garage but you\\'ll need a small car and a steady hand to get in.   It can be done!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is urban living at it\\'s finest which may include noise if warm weather requires the windows to be open.  Air-conditioning is rare in homes here.  But if you are lucky enough to have great weather like we did it\\'s a fair trade.  Room fans create some white-noise and it cools down at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nJean\\'s townhouse was perfect for our family of five.  Enough privacy and bathrooms for all and a warm, welcoming living area to spend time together. She\\'s thought of all the details in the kitchen right down to chopsticks!  I highly recommend!!! Jean was very easy to communicate with and provided detailed arrival instructions.  The townhouse was very clean and well prepared for our arrival with fresh towels and bedding.  The kitchen and living area on the 2nd floor was well designed and convenient of our group which was there for business, so we were able to create a makeshift office and had plenty of space for our files and materials.  The bedrooms on the 3rd floor each had a bathroom with plenty of space and even shampoo, conditioner, and body soap for our use.  Overall this was the best AirBnB experience I\\'ve had now out of 4.  I highly recommend this townhouse.  Oh, and although we were working with little free time to explore, we did find the town of Ballard with its restaurants and bars very convenient and a short drive away.   The place is clean, beautiful, and well-lit -as advertised. Our family of five found it quite comfortable. Jean was responsive and efficient. She came through for us with very short notice and was easy to work with throughout our stay. The garage was a tight fit for our rental SUV but we had no trouble finding street parking just a few steps out the front door. I love the little balcony just off the living room: a perfect spot for mom and dad to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee but still keep an eye on what the kids are doing! My family and I had a wonderful time at Jean\\'s house! It was beautiful! She even left a new stuffed animal for my daughter to have which was such a sweet thing to do. Ballard is such a great neighborhood and it\\'s so close to everything. The Mexican restaurant El Camion is just a short walk away and it\\'s very good! The house is just 15 min away from city center downtown which is great for sightseeing. The house was very well appointed with everything we needed in the bathrooms and kitchen. We would definitely stay here again!  This condo was beautiful, Jean was in contact with us through out the whole trip. This was our first experience using airbnb and I was very impressed. Jean\\'s house is conveniently located but yet the neighborhood is quiet.  The house is well equipped and maintained.  Jean is very responsive to my messages and answers.  All those have helped my first Airbnb experience and my first visit to Seattle a very pleasant one. \\r\\nI recommend this place to stay.\\r\\n Beautiful place to stay. Was outfitted with all the essentials needed to make it feel homey. Great location, close to most everything. We had no problem finding street parking all day/night long. Would stay again if we come back to Seattle.  We rented Jean\\'s townhouse so friends and I could stay under one roof, and we were so happy with the experience! The house was beautifully clean and tidy, with enough linens and a great kitchen. We liked the location because it was far enough out of downtown Seattle to be able to feel like we were able to get to all of the various (and cool) neighbourhoods in the surrounding areas. Around the corner from the house is an amazing French bakery, (so tasty!) and a brunch place listed as the best brunch in Seattle. So, worth a visit if you don\\'t mind waiting! There\\'s a track to run on near the house if you feel like sprinting a few laps, and parking was ample. The house was also a safe place for a small child, which our group had. Jean was kind and attentive throughout the whole process, including providing little details for the baby. Also, the kitchen was perfect for making feasts and we had a fabulous time! Thank you for everything Jean!  I stayed at the house for 2 nights with 6 other girlfriends. We came from San Francisco to hang out with our Seattle friends for a bachelorette party. \\r\\nThe house was great, very comfortable and perfect for a group of girls\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m familiar with Seattle so knew about the neighborhood and was perfect for us. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnly bad thing was once we already had checked out, I received a message from  Jean asking if more than 7 people stayed at the house. \\r\\nWhen the cleaner came at 9:55 she saw 10 girls outside the house and assumed we had all spent the night. With us, the cleaner was super nice and apologized for being a bit early but then lied and said we checked out late. \\r\\nIf it wasn\\'t for this, I would give a 5 star and would recommend it.  Jean was friendly, efficient, and wonderful to work with. The house was clean, neat, cozy, and exactly as pictured. It\\'s a great little spot close to a lot of wonderful restaurants. I\\'d recommend this place to anyone looking to explore Seattle. It\\'s wonderful that bedrooms are on separate floors for added privacy when staying in a group.  很不错的房子，适合我们一家六口出行，房东Jean 准备得非常周到，甚至有宝宝餐具和备用的床品，房间里面也很方便清洁，易于维护，我们度过了很愉快的一周.住所周围有Safeway 和Walgreen ，离wholefoods 也不远，位置很好.就在Ballard 高中边上.离pike市场和Seattle Center 仅十五分钟车程 The place was perfect for our group of 7.  It was in a nice and quiet neighborhood, easily driveable to a lot of the places we wanted to visit during our trip.  I\\'d definitely recommend this spot for groups larger than 5.   Jean was easy to contact and quick to respond whenever I had a question. Home was great.  First Airbnb experience and first time to Ballard and really liked it.  A lot around and Jean was also very responsive and gave some fun suggestions on what to do in the area.  Really enjoyed our stay!!  Jean is very responsive and easy to work with.  The townhouse is nice, as advertised.  The housekeeper showed up right at checkout time.  This is my 1st experience with Airbnb, and it\\'s amazing. The room I chose for one night staying in Seattle was beautiful, clean, cozy and convenient. Perfect for a family with or without children. It has all we wanted. The location is very close to the shopping centre and restaurants. The rooms are spacious and the beds are so comfortable and I had very good sleep. Thank you Jean for offering this wonderful home and I will definitely rebook this place when I visit Seattle next year.  This is my first Air Bnb experience. I was traveling with my colleague. We had a wonderful time in Jean\\'s house. It was clean and in good position. Only 7 miles to space needle. We checked out the place by running. If you are trying to find a place like home and hang out with your friends, that is a good option. We enjoyed our stay at Jean\\'s place.  Check in and out was a breeze with the instructions and lock box left by Jean.  The place was very comfortable, spacious and clean.  Located in a residential neighborhood with several new townhouses coming up and a school across the street, it was very quiet and comfortable.  But we didn\\'t spend too much time in the immediate area around the house. We feel very fortunate to have found this sweet place.  We needed somewhere to stay very last minute and Lara was incredibly understanding and welcoming.  The space is comfortable and very clean, and we really appreciated being able to have our dogs stay as well.  \\r\\nThe hosts provided us with everything we needed and were very responsive to any questions we had.  Awesome location about a mile from downtown Ballard with tons of cute places to visit.  I did brewery and distillery tours and lots of gift shopping for the holidays.  Lara also lent me a great bike that got me super easily over to the Fremont area as well, where there is more of the same- great restaurants etc.  The bike trail (Burke-Gilman) is just at the bottom of the hill from the house which is in a very nice quiet neighborhood.  I did not ride super far on the trail, but apparently it is quite long and will take you to tons of great Seattle spots!  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room itself is more than a room- has its own bathroom, kitchenette and everything I would need if I wanted a totally private stay.  Pretty much the entire downstairs to the whole house is all yours.  Very clean and comfortable with a fun tiki theme.  It was raining when I was up there and somewhat cold, but I was plenty warm and cozy in the space and Lara left out extra blankets just in case.  As it was wet outside, I did not utilize the patio, but nice area with a little fire pit and plenty of seating that would be great for use during better weather.  Would be an awesome reading spot with all of the passion fruit vines in bloom!    \\r\\n\\r\\nMore on the host: As I mentioned before, I could have had a completely private and solitary stay if desired, but Lara was super helpful and sweet.  When getting all the bike stuff from her she was also great about giving directions and suggestions which were all perfect for what I was looking for.  We actually walked to a little happy hour spot for some evening snacks and had a great visit.  Awesome lady who has travelled a lot, as have I, with tons of great stories.  Very friendly and genuine, but also perfectly respectful of \"my\" space downstairs.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall:  would highly recommend this place!  Amazing location, super digs that are clean and comfortable and private as well as my favorite airbnb hosts so far!  And of course the icing on the cake: the bicycle borrowing availability!...and the easy access to trails and local spots via bike- or walking for that matter- major bonus in my travel preferences.  Would definitely stay at Lara\\'s again and will most likely try to book again soon when I\\'m up there checking out grad school at UW!  \\r\\n\\r\\nOh yeah- forgot to mention, she has the cutest little puppy!  A bit shy at first, but once she warms up, she is the biggest sweetheart with the funkiest hair do ever;)  Love love love!  \\r\\n\\r\\n  Lara did a great job of making us welcomed with a bottle of champagne and beautiful flowers. The location was good for us as we wanted to spend most of our time in Ballard. The apartment is as pictured. It\\'s pretty quiet. Lara was a great host, very welcoming and understanding of our situation. We needed a monthly rental and she was accomadating with both of us and our 80lb dog. The mini fridge was broken when we got there, and she immediately got us a new fridge. The place was stocked with toiletries, toilet paper and some cooking utensils. It was cozy and warm and it was great having laundry access. Whenever we needed anything for the apartment, we would text and she would get back to us quickly. \\r\\nThe area was very convenient and we could always find parking on the block. Overall it was a great place to crash for a month.  My fiancee and I, along with our 2 dogs stayed, with Lara for about 3 months while we closed on our new home.  Finding ourselves in a new state/city and feeling quite unconnected, Lara went well out of our way to make us feel comfortable and at-home at all times.  Lara is an amazing person, striking the perfect balance between privacy and hostess-care.  She cooked us some delicious meals, and is an ideal resource for activities and interests in the area.  The space she provides is cozy, spacious, and great for either short-term or long-term stays.  If you\\'re looking for luxury, perhaps you\\'d be more comfortable in a hotel.  However, if you prefer for a more personal experience in the heart of Ballard, look no further than Lara. We were warmly welcomed and made feel comfortably at home by Lara.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accommodation was accurately described in the listing. It is well set up for long-term stays with necessary equipment for laundry and simple dining in. A very good deli is around the corner as is a great little neighborhood restaurant/bistro, \"The Barking Dog.\" Other dining and pub possibilities are in easy walking distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nLara\\'s fenced backyard and patio provide a place for a dog to stretch and the neighborhood is well suited for dog walking. Lara is a caring host for people and pets.\\r\\n\\r\\nA frequent service busline to downtown Seattle is very convenient. The central location is a plus. It is midway between the University of Washington campus-I-5 corridor and the Ballard waterfront and beach parks along the Sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis modest accommodation is well suited for a long and comfortable stay. Our stay at Cleopatra Casa was awesome.  Lara was super helpful and accommodating.  Clean, comfortable, and quiet basement apartment.  Separate bedroom and living room was a plus.  Cable TV, clean towels and coffee to make you feel at home.  Quiet neighborhood within walking distance of cool bars and restaurants.  We\\'ll definitely stay here again next time we\\'re in Seattle!! Nice neighborhood. The back yard is next to 8th Ave., a busy street, but it wasn\\'t very noisy. Lara left flowers, coffee, and granola for our use. She was very flexible with our arrival time. My dad was visiting from California. We live in Ballard and Lara\\'s place was a short drive from our house. I booked this space for him. Lara was friendly right from the start. I never met her, but my dad said she was incredibly friendly and helpful. The space was clean and comfortable. We sat out in the private yard area every day he was there. It was just as described. It is very close to restaurants. My dad walked to The Fat Hen 2 days in a row for their delicious breakfast. Great experience!  We had a fantastic stay here over a long weekend, while we worked at an event at the Seattle Center. This was our first Airbnb experience, and it couldn\\'t have been better! The space was clean and inviting, easy to access, and Lara was very friendly and easy to reach in all her communications.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were worried it might get hot during a heatwave, but the basement space was very cool and had a big oscillating fan for us to use. The private, outdoor patio was awesome for relaxing in the evenings. \\r\\n\\r\\nStreet parking was easy to find, even with a large trailer on our car. The bus lines nearby made it really easy to get to downtown during the day, and there was a lot within a few blocks in the neighborhood. We definitely want to come back! Ballard is a beautiful neighborhood with lots to see, while staying very laidback. Lara communicated very well and was flexible with our arrival time which we appreciated since we were driving from OH. The many thoughtful touches--flashlight, comfortable bedding, kitchen supplies including homemade granola--made us feel right at home. We were also grateful for the use of a washer and dryer during out stay.The apt. was cool and comfortable with a cool breeze crossing between windows in an uncharacteristically hot, dry summer. Our daughter who lives nearby chose to stay with us for this reason.  We enjoyed the location and Ballard restaurants and cafes were delightful when we were not eating on the patio with family. We also enjoyed the Ballard Locks and our pet dog enjoyed his meal at the Barking Dog Ale House and the many dog water dishes on the sidewalks in the area. Nearby Kirche Park was a favorite for all of us. Very cute and clean apartment! Lara was a great host! Thanks a lot!  Lara was very welcoming & the apartment was exactly as described. The neighborhood felt very safe (we took several walks) & also used the bus since the stop was so close & parking in the city was expensive. We would definitely use this place again. Yeah i have lots of stories to write about. Although i didn\\'t have a chance to see host but, every time asked her for a favor she helped me out so well \\nAnd i have to say sorry i disturbed host middle of nights... Anyway the basement was really amazing cozy to stay everying is well prepared!!! Highly recommen you guys to stay We spent 3 nights at Lara\\'s place during our recent trip to Seattle.  The accommodation was clean, quiet and cozy.  We appreciated there being a nice pack of good local coffee. Lara was very helpful and flexible with our late arrival time.  Her assistance with the bicycles was absolutely fantastic.  There is a deli and food shop next to a nearby bus stop.  That bus route runs right through the downtown Seattle area which made our sightseeing very convenient.  Ballard is a friendly neighborhood and the Fremont area is a short bike ride away. Definitely a basement! We walked down a steep, creaky staircase right next to owners\\' kitchen, covered by a curtain. There were several open spaces filled with stuff that were covered by cloths. There was an odd smell that permeated the place our entire stay. Not to mention the 2 huge spiders we had to squash (yes, I\\'m aware it\\'s a basement). \\nThe amenities were nice! Especially the washer/dryer. Lara was great at communicating and checked in on us via text! We appreciated the mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee/coffee maker (although we had to clean it before use). The bedroom was a nice reprieve with the window open and a nice comfortable bed!! The location was cool. We walked to the Fat Hen and had a delicious breakfast.\\n\\nI just didn\\'t have the same feelings as the rest of the reviewers and thought I should be as honest as possible. This place wasn\\'t for me. The price is right, but next time, I\\'ll fork up more money and stay elsewhere...I actually considered that the minute I walked in. My almost 12 yr old daughter & I spent 3 nights with Lara and it was such a nice relaxing experience. Lara  was very welcoming & great with all communications. The apartment was actually so much better than listing, everything was spot on. The bed is super comfy as well as the couch-which was greatly appreciated after sight seeing around town all day we were sore & tired! The space is quiet and we barely heard anyone upstairs. Awesome shower head/water pressure as well as plenty of hot water!  The space is equipped with everything one would need, including a lovely side yard with BBQ & a patio. The neighborhood is perfect as it\\'s between Ballard & Phinney Ridge so finding a coffee shop or a bite to eat is easy-even for those not familiar with Seattle. We parked the car on the street & left it there for most of our visit, opting to use the bus which is right by Lara\\'s place. It took us to Fremont /Downtown/Pike Place, as well as the Space Needle. The neighborhood is a relaxing & residential, away from hustle & bustle from downtown, yet close enough to get to if that\\'s what you like as well. Lara has lived in Seattle for years , she loves the city & knows it like the back of her-she  can help with ideas & advice if need be. We\\'ll be staying with her again the next time we get up to Seattle & I\\'ll be recommending her space to all my friends.  Very welcoming. Lara made check in so simply especially because we arrived in Seattle very late. She had the best restaurant suggestions and offered help often. We were a pretty quiet couple who were gone most of the day so it was great to come home to a quiet home at night. The apt was just the right size for us and the location was amazing. It was a real bang for our buck!  We only wished that we could have seen sweet little Zoe more.  Lara\\'s place was perfect for myself, a friend and her pup for a long weekend. The bed is uber comfy and we had more than enough room. We really dug how close her place is to several shops and restaurants in Ballard. Overall a great stay! We had a great stay in Lara\\'s apartment! The neighborhood has restaurants within walking distance, though we had a car so didn\\'t use any of the public transportation options. The kitchenette worked well for us. We didn\\'t want to cook so no need for a full kitchen, but it was nice to be able to make coffee and heat up leftovers, and it was stocked with some convenience items like coffee, oatmeal, etc. Lara was helpful and responsive by text with any questions that came up. It is definitely a basement apartment so low ceilings and limited natural light, but it had everything we needed, was clean, spacious, and well-priced. We enjoyed a great 3 night stay at Lara\\'s place, which had everything we needed. From the start, Lara made the check-in process very easy and was good about communicating with us even before arrival. When we arrived, we noticed that there is only a curtain separating the downstairs airbnb unit from the main house. However, this was not an issue at all because we still had all the privacy we wanted. The bedroom gets good natural lighting whereas the living room does not, so we spent our nights and evenings in the living room and that turned out just fine. The neighborhood is residential so it was nice and quiet for sleeping. We took the 28 bus to go downtown and it worked out well. Thanks for a great stay!  We enjoyed our visit. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Lara is very welcoming and we hope to stay with her in the future. Quiet, private, food and drink nearby. Exactly what I needed. Lara has gone above & beyond to make sure our stay has been great! She\\'s always available when needed &  has even been a huge help with our pup! We couldn\\'t be more happier with her as a host. This was a convenient location, with parking. The cottage was well equipped and surprisingly tranquil.  Annie\\'s adorable cottage was just as described.     It\\'s small but provides the amenities you want.  It was a perfect place for us to spend a couple of nights in Seattle visiting friends in our old neighborhood.     Even though it is off a busy street, it was quiet at night.  The bed was very comfortable.    Annie\\'s place was fantastic. Great location, right near the hustle and bustle of Ballard which has great restaurants and bars, plus access to buses (an express bus to downtown!). \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a light and airy little cottage, yet also has heaps of space for anything you might need. While we did not meet Annie as she was away, Annie was really lovely and accommodating, and even sourced us a blow up mattress before she left! \\r\\n\\r\\nI would highly reccommend this little cottage to anyone hoping to check out Ballard/Seattle.  Annie\\'s place was perfect for what we needed.  Her communication was excellent and covered all the bases.  Her home is clean and well kept.  To make the place even better, it\\'s located less than a block from Un Bien, an absolutely incredible Caribbean sandwich shop. Y-U-M!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would gladly stay at Annie\\'s again and would recommend it to our friends.  Had a great stay. Good quiet location , close to old Ballard neighborhood, restaurants and shops.  15 min drive into Capitol Hill.  The cottage was clean, quiet and comfy. Would come back again.  The house was great. Annie was quick to respond and very amenable working around our flight for our check in and check out times. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Ballard.  This place was adorable and cozy and perfectly located just a minutes walk from the bus stop. We loved the area and felt right at home here. Annie left us a bottle of wine because it was my birthday which was so sweet. She was also so accommodating of our schedule and let us check in early. The bed was comfortable and everything was just great! Stay here!  Annie\\'s Mother in Law Cottage was amazing. It was very clean and had everything we needed. Annie was always available for communication. The Cottage is located in the perfect location, close to everything. I would definitely stay here again.  My friend and I had a great time staying there. Our host, Karina, was really nice, friendly, and kind person, also the place was located in Ballard so we could walk around and explore the neighborhood during our stay. She also gave us recomendations on some tourist attractions. As I said she was friendly and welcomed us a lot, but at the same time, she respected our private time so we could feel relaxed and comfortable staying at her apartment. Her pets were so adorable too! This was my first time using airbnb so I was a little bit nervous at first, but I\\'m glad I could make a good choice staying in such a nice person\\'s place!  Had a great first airbnb experience with Karina. We were nervous about trying it out, but she made us feel very welcome. She was very hospitable and gave us good suggestions on local tourist attractions and transportation advice. It was our first time in Ballard and we had a wonderful time with the help of Karina. She was very honest, upfront about the accommodation, and friendly. Her pets are also the sweetest! If we ever make the trip down for the Solstice Parade again, we will most definitely get in touch with her.  I loved staying with Karina, she was so incredibly welcoming and I felt completely relaxed around her and her two beautiful fur babies (one adorable sweet natured dog and one cool cat). Karina was such a great host, you could hang with her or do your own thing. She was never in your space and if you did want the place to yourself she was more than happy to do so. I was more than happy hanging out with Karina, she has been living in Ballard for years and knows all the hidden treasures. Ballard is such a great neighborhood and Karina\\'s apartment was in a great location.   Karina was a wonderful hostess! Her apartment was sparkling clean, very cozy, and very welcoming. She was also EXTREMELY helpful, telling me how to get there via public transportation, giving restaurant recommendations, and various other tips that really made a huge difference. The location of her apartment is ideal, and only a short walk to downtown Ballard, which has cute shops, restaurants, and pubs.\\n\\nI absolutely and highly recommend Karina. She\\'s extremely attentive, sweet, and very welcoming. Karina\\'s dog was awesome! And so was her cat! And also, Karina was pretty great company as well :) Nice apartment in Ballard, we had a great stay, and would stay again in a heartbeat. We loved staying with Karina and her dog and cat. The place was very well positioned close to great cafe\\'s, restaurants and bars and Karina was super bubbly and friendly, happy to help accommodate us with anything we needed. I Highly recommend her place!  Karina (a great AirBnb host), Lucy (the amazing, never (!) barking and good smelling - I wish my dog was like that - dog) and Phylo (the chillin\\' and friendly cat) are AMAZING!!! We highly recommend staying with Karina at her well located, very clean and big (it is actually much bigger than it appears on the pictures - you have plenty of space) apartment in the trendy neighborhood of Ballard in Seattle. Market Street was our favorite street: many great local and alternative bars, restaurants and shops AND great people. It\\'s a very save area with plenty of stuff to do! For instant you can visit the Ballard Locks and watch the ships coming in to the port of Seattle. It\\'s also easy to get downtown. You just take the bus around the corner and you\\'re there in about 10 till 15 min (depending on traffic). Thank you for the great time :)  My husband and I got in a bind when our original bnb was cancelled at the last minute. Karina took us in and we had a very good experience. She was very open and made us feel right at home. We could catch the bus right outside her apartment and there were restaurants within walking distance. My husband and I wanted to steal her pets and take them home. Thanks Karina Karina is considerate and helpful; everything worked out great with my stay! Lisa and her family we outstanding hosts!   The location was great as well, we were close to pretty much everything in the Seattle area.  The home itself was very clean and well taken care and was stocked with pretty much anything and everything you might need for your stay!  It made our first experience with Airbnb a great one.  I would highly recommend Lisa and her family as your next host in Seattle.  I know me and my family will be giving them a call on our next visit!! We had a lovely time in this spotless, energy-efficient two-story cottage.  The bamboo floors are gorgeous, there is great separation of space, the bathroom is top notch, there is a nice sized closet, and the upstairs bed is very comfortable (the kids slept very well on the futon downstairs).  Fantastic location also - great restaurants & coffee around the corner and an easy, quick drive to downtown Seattle.  Even though Lisa was traveling, she was always available and is a charming and helpful host.  We will most definitely stay here again!   The house was perfect - warm, quiet, clean and comfortable. There\\'s everything you could need to feel like you\\'re at home - a well stocked kitchen (including pans, blenders, coffee machine, grater, microwave, toaster etc); washer and dryer; TV with inputs for USB and DVD; a sound system with auxiliary cable to hook up your own iPod; hanging space; comfortable beds; full blinds so you can sleep in, you name it! The small things make travel so much easier - providing shampoo and conditioner in the shower, oils and condiments in the pantry, and washing powder in the laundry.\\r\\nWhen we arrived the hosts had snacks and necessities ready for us - a delicious loaf of bread, local beers, tea, coffee, eggs, yoghurt, milk, even guacamole.\\r\\nThe hosts - Lisa, Sean and Fin - were incredibly welcoming, friendly and generous. They would be there to chat, share a drink and tell us about Seattle if we wanted, but otherwise gave us complete privacy. They\\'d give us a lift down the street if they saw us walking along.\\r\\nThe area Ballard is great - delicious food, coffee and groceries are all very close. The part of Ballard the house is in is quiet, with beautiful flowers in the Spring time. However the bus (only a 4 minute walk away) takes you straight to downtown and the Pike Place Market area. Ballard \"proper\" is a 20 minute walk downhill, which has an incredible choice of hip bars, eateries, music venues, vintage stores, record stores and artisan fashion stores.\\r\\nWe stayed at week at the Ballard Backyard Cottage and were extremely sad to leave, and hope to stay in contact with the great hosts in the future. The cottage was super clean, efficient and well set up. Like the other reviews, just about anything you might need is supplied (hair dryer!). Lisa and her family are excellent hosts, conscientious and very classy. We really appreciated the \"eco-ness\" of the cottage and learned a few things ourselves! The beds & sheets are comfy, the neighborhood is peaceful and the few noises very soothing. We slept very well. The location is central to just about anywhere you want to go, and grounding to come back to. The cottage would make a perfect artist studio/getaway as well, hint hint!\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth my daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We highly recommend this place. : ) This was a charming, spotlessly clean, quiet, and aesthetic little cottage with everything we needed for our week-long stay.  Lisa and her family were welcoming with flowers and even some goodies.  One of the nicest places I\\'ve stayed in through Airbnb.  We look forward to coming back again some day!    What a delightful, inventive, wonderful backyard cottage.  Very clever use of space that somehow manages to provide every single thing you would need, including wifi and washer and dryer, and even fresh coffee.  Our hosts, Lisa and Sean, were at the ready to help or respond to questions, and we had a terrific time.  The cottage is located in a beautiful neighborhood of Ballard, and we hope  to return many times.  Thank you Lisa and Sean for your kind hospitality and for sharing this lovely cottage.  Lisa was a great host and the voyage was the most amazing place. It was great for me and two of my friends. There\\'s a comfy upstairs bed and a comfy futon downstairs. Lisa and her husband were very welcoming. And have us a few tips on where to go. Wish we would have had more time to sit and chat. great location! several cool bars to walk. And a short drive (or uber/lyft) ride to main Ballard area. Not far from down town either. It was also super easy to check in Lisa made sure we had all the info we needed to get into the cottage after our 13 hr drive to Seattle. I would stay there again if I come into town. Thanks! Lisa and Shawn were wonderful hosts, and their cottage was perfect for the two of us!  Clean, comfortable, and very well appointed with everything we needed for our weekend stay. And the location in Ballard is perfect!  The cottage is within easy walking distance to several of the fantastic restaurants in Ballard.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighly recommended!!\\r\\n we absolutely loved the design of the house, the great usage of space. it was clean upon rental, quiet neighbourhood, easy access to bus route to downtown seattle, basic groceries nearby. good water heater.\\r\\nperhaps an iron would be useful. wonder if it is around there somewhere but we couldnt find it. otherwise, we are looking into booking this wonderful home again next year if we were to visit seattle again. take care!\\r\\noh another thing, this house is so environmental friendly! from their shampoos to their towels even their car. if many of us practiced this, our world would be a healthier place! note to my country, malaysia. Lisa was just great.  Very responsive to our questions and we spend a nice half hour chat upon our departure.  The cottage was perfect for our needs too.  Very clean, modern and perfect for the two of us.  We will be back! Loved this spot, wish we could have stayed all summer! Very welcoming and comfortable, great location near lots of shops and restaurants, and only a short ride to DT, Capitol Hill, etc. Lisa and her husband were very friendly when we arrived and we especially loved the outdoor area, adorable cat included. Would definitely stay again!  Our 2nd stay, and it was fantastic!  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis cottage is super clean, quiet, comfortable, and Lisa and Shawn are wonderful hosts.  From freshly roasted local coffee and a French press, local/organic soaps/lotions/shampoos and more, this little cottage has everything we need.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighly, highly recommended and thankful for how close this cottage is to Ballard.  Thanks guys!!  This was our family\\'s first airbnb experience, and it couldn\\'t have gone better. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cottage is exactly as pictured/described, which is to say, it\\'s clean, modern, quiet, and in an AWESOME neighborhood. (We were just minutes from great restaurants, coffee, the Sunday Farmers Market, and parks, like the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks.)  \\r\\n\\r\\nAdding to the experience, our host Lisa, had us feeling like old friends, and was happy to chat, and gave us plenty of privacy as well. She had several suggestions for places to eat, etc., close to cottage (tip: don\\'t miss the Fat Hen nearby). \\r\\n\\r\\nHighly recommended for anyone exploring Seattle and the Ballard neighborhood. Will definitely return again.  The cottage was fantastic! It had everything we needed to make small meals in the kitchen, and it was quite clean. We would definitely stay here again. We didn\\'t have a chance to meet Lisa, but she was very responsive and friendly over email. The neighborhood is nice as well. Highly recommended. This cottage is fantastic! It is a great location, nestled in a lively and accessible neighborhood. The cottage itself was immaculate -- super clean, great furnishings and every detail neatly accounted for. Lisa was quick to respond and very helpful in communications before booking, in the days leading up to our stay, and while we were there. We only stayed two nights, but this would be a very comfortable set up for a much longer stay. By far the nicest airbnb place I\\'ve seen and I\\'ll definitely stay there again if I head back to Seattle! The hosts were very kind and gave excellent information about amenities in the neighborhood. The cottage was very clean and practically brand new (only about 5 years old). Perfect for a single person (downstairs on the futon) and a couple upstairs or a family. I really enjoyed relaxing on the shared deck. There are restaurants and an upscale market with wine/coffee close by. It\\'s a very quiet neighborhood as well. I loved it! Enjoy! Lisa was an excellent host, the cottage was cozy and well-appointed with all modern conveniences. The neighborhood is quiet, lovely homes and gardens, especially Lisa\\'s. The deck/outdoor seating area are a plus, and never had a problem with on-street parking. We enjoyed our stay immensely. \\r\\n\\r\\nBallard is a lovely village with great architecture and, although it\\'s not exactly within walking distance, it\\'s nearby with ample parking. We ended up spending more time strolling around there than in the city. Great shops for all tastes, a nice buzz and very friendly shop/gallery people and locals. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe People\\'s Pub was fun and very inexpensive, food and pitchers hit the spot. The \"Rajun Cajun\" sandwich at the Other Coast restaurant was to die for (I never use that phrase), and Café Besalu is a must. Cupcake Royale has lovely staff with $2 ice cream cones (homemade, fantastic, tasting encouraged) on Tuesdays. Clover has a very broad and interesting stock of toys. Kids sorted with those two stops.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeattle is a quick bus trip for $2.50, and the #28 is a quick walk from the cottage. It took us to downtown tourist activities, and the #40 bus returned us to the center of Ballard. Don\\'t miss the Locks and the Fish Ladder, we watched salmon, seals and herons for hours. So much more, but you can do your own research and have fun. We\\'ll be back! Truly a top-notch Airbnb experience. Hosts were friendly, chill, and generous with neighborhood and city recommendations. Cottage is new, clean, charming, cozy, and very functional despite being a relatively small space. Check-in and check-out were super easy and the neighborhood is a great place to make a home base provided you have a rental car. There is great walkable stuff as well - microbreweries, coffee, restaurants, bakeries. Highly recommended! Lisa and Sean were amazing!  The backyard cottage was exactly as they had described.  Great neighborhood with easy access to public transportation.   The Ballard Backyard Cottage is a fantastic little house in a residential area. We loved the two levels which give you more space and privacy if you travel with friends or kids. A very well equipped kitchen, an amazing bathroom - with plenty of towels and a nice assortment of care products - makes you feel at home! Everything is super clean. We also loved the wooden terrace where you can take your meals or relax. \\r\\nLisa and the whole family are extremely nice people. the communication was very easy and efficient. We got the information we needed at the right moment. Lisa also put some very nice coffee and chocolate for us on arrival and we found all the basics in the fridge. \\r\\nIt is definitely an excellent choice in Seattle and we can warmly recommend it to anybody! Lisa was easy to communicate with, and very prompt with her responses.  The cottage is located in a great part of Ballard - very quiet residential area, and a short walking distance to many local destinations - Old Ballard, restaurants, breweries/taprooms.  The cottage is in excellent condition and had more than enough amenities for our 2-day stay. I would absolutely recommend the cottage for anyone staying in Ballard. Our hosts were gracious and helpful in orienting us to the bus system and our first airbnb experience, making it a delightful one indeed.  The neighborhood is great.  There was even an indoor swimming pool available nearby.  The little house is great and made for a \"home away from home\".  The space, tho small was ample for the two of us, very clean and Lisa had stocked the frig with our favorite breakfast items.  So we could leisurely get up, have great coffee (provided) and eat.  The outdoors area was real nice as well.  Lisa and Sean were terrific hosts as they always made us feel comfortable and their son Finn is adorable.  Marion and I loved it and would revisit again.  We loved your cottage. It was just perfect for us. Thank you so much for all the breakfast items and other goodies you left us. We had a great time and look forward to staying at your cottage again.  Wow!  Lisa and her family were gracious, helpful, and delightful hosts.  She provided quick follow up during the reservation process and offered assistance during our stay without every being obtrusive.  Terrific personal exchanges.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy family of four loved the cottage.  We were impressed by its clever design to make maximum use of a small footprint while providing every needed amenity.  It was like a Danish Modern ship.  The cottage provides a well equipped kitchen, a beautiful bathroom with a terrific shower (great towels, washcloths, soaps, shampoo and conditioner provided) , a washer and dryer, a well executed desk area with WiFi, two comfortable full sized beds, and comfortable living area (with wall mounted TV/entertainment) with well stocked DVDs for all ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe loved the Ballard neighborhood.  The immediate neighborhood is a lovely residential area, with restaurants and cafes blocks away.  We found it a convenient location to get to all of our destinations in the Seattle area.  One night we had take-out from a wonderful neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant and ate it outside at the patio dining table and chairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe look forward to returning to the Ballard Backyard Cottage in the future! The Ballard Backyard Cottage was perfect for our family of 4.  It had everything we needed - kitchen, laundry, separate spaces for adults and kids to sleep, even some nice outdoor space.  The cottage is lovely and light and well finished.  Lisa was a wonderfully helpful host, happy to offer recommendations and more.  She even offered our kids a bucket of toys.  We were visiting friends in Ballard so this was the perfect lodging solution.  We felt like we had our only private apartment, a retreat for us and our kids.  We would definitely return and recommend it to anyone.   The Ballard backyard cottage was perfect for our little family.  Lisa, Sean and Finn were amazingly sweet! The cottage has everything you need and more to enjoy your stay in Ballard! We walked to downtown with our little baby Rainn (11 months) and really enjoyed the neighborhood and the walks. Lisa was very nice in providing us with yummy goodies in the fridge and a tasty chocolate bar.  Our baby really enjoyed the bucket of toys ready for him when we arrived.  Did I already mention the cottage is absolutely beautiful!  Nice place  This was my first airbnb experience and Lisa set the bar high. I loved this cottage and would recommend it to anyone. New, clean, stylish, and comfortable. I was able to walk to the bus and go downtown easily. Lisa helped me with directions and even gave me free bus passes. The kitchen was fully stocked will all equipment necessary for making even a complicated meal, and the fridge and pantry had lots of great basics (butter, PB, cooking oil, etc.). This was a great surprise since I\\'m a single mom traveling with two small kids and needed to cook for us. My only regret is that I packed our vacation so tight that I didn\\'t get to spend more time with Lisa and her lovely family. My kids made me promise we\\'ll come back and spend more time. And we will. Fabulous place and great owners. Super quiet neighborhood, yet easy to get any place in Seattle you\\'d like to go. Lisa even had my favorite beer and a chocolate bar waiting for me. A+++ We had a wonderful stay at Ballard Backyard Cottage.  Our host was very accommodating and friendly.  The place was exceptionally clean and modern.  The beds were comfortable and the shower was hot.  We would definitely stay there again!  Wonderful home and hosts! They made us feel quite comfortable and would happily return to their beautiful property. Clean, green, and welcoming! The cottage was outstanding. We really loved all the attention to detail in the construction. The Ballard neighborhood is beautiful. Lisa and her family were great and we would stay here again for sure. Totally enjoyed the Ballard Backyard. We travelled to Seattle for Bumbershoot with a 6 year old in tow and this place could not of been more perfect. Close to transit (easy commute to downtown), in a great neighbourhood, neat space, our only complaint is that we wished we could of stayed longer. This place exceeded our expectations from the pictures online.  It was a charming well located property with all of the necessary essentials available.  We felt very welcome.  The neighborhood was great for walking, easy street parking and very accessible to the city.  This was our first airbnb experience and it was wonderful.\\r\\nDinah and Bob\\r\\n My friends stayed at Lisa\\'s cottage. They told me Lisa was very friendly and welcoming.  We had the most wonderful stay at Lisa\\'s backyard cottage.  This place is truly a gem in the heart of Ballard.  The cottage was well-furnished and so much thought has clearly gone into making this place a very functional, cozy and easy home away from home.  There was not a single thing that we needed and couldn\\'t find here!  We were also so grateful for all of the help in making the stay easy on our 17 month old--the cottage had a pack n\\' play, high chair, big box of books and toys (to her delight!) and plates, utensils, etc. for little hands.  Lisa got us settled in, made sure we were comfortable and was accessible for questions, but the place felt incredibly private as well.  This will most certainly be our pick for a place to stay the next time we\\'re in Seattle! Our stay was wonderful. The cottage was extremely clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. Lots of towels, shampoo, lotion, coffee, and much more! Great use of space. Lots of windows to enjoy the cool temperature. Nice shower. The patio was really nice and peaceful…great after a busy day in downtown Seattle. The neighborhood was quiet and there was always on street parking available. Lisa was very friendly and a great host. We highly recommend the Ballard Backyard Cottage! Our stay couldn\\'t have been better. The cottage was clean, comfortable, and stocked with everything we needed. There was enough space and privacy to make the stay enjoyable for a couple + one. Clearly, Lisa and her family put a lot of work and love into this place to make it as warm and welcoming as possible.\\r\\nThe neighborhood was also a delight. At no point did we feel unease travelling back from our night time treks into the city. There are multiple bus stops within walking distance and wonderful restaurants and shops nearby.\\r\\nLisa even had vegan toiletries ready for us picky guests. We had a great experience and couldn\\'t recommend her cottage and hospitality enough. This gem of a cottage was great, I lucked out as it was terrific weather in the Seattle area and I was able to walk to my destination everyday, the neighborhood was safe and very walkable to the surrounding area.  The cottage was clean and well appointed.  I didn\\'t get a chance to meet the host as my schedule was really busy but it was all so well organized I did not need to ask for anything. What a great place.  The Ballard Backyard Cottage is a wonderful place to spend a few days.  The neighbourhood is great - easy access to food and drink, transport.   The space is well organized and comfortable, the check-in process was easy and everything needed was available.  Thank you Lisa.   Better than the description! Humidity controller in the bathroom and surround sound on the TV set up??  This is a very well appointed, modern, clean place in the trendy Ballard neighborhood.  The friend and rotund feline addition is also a nice touch. \\n\\nLisa even met us 2 days before our reservation to let us drop off plants so that we could go to Canada without fear of getting them confiscated.  (Thanks again) \\n\\nGreat experience; highly recommended. \\n\\n Lisa was quite responsive and made us feel very welcome! The property itself was great. Very clean, with good amenities and we loved the style. Ballard is a quaint neighborhood, good for relaxing evening walks after exploring the city. I\\'ll definitely recommend Lisa and the Ballard Backyard Cottage to my friends and other colleagues, and hope to stay here again next time in the area! We enjoyed a lovely stay at the Backyard Cottage. The area is quiet and easy to find parking. The place is very clean, comfortable, and well stocked with items for the kitchen and the bathroom. It was a 25 minute walk to NW Market Street and Ballard Ave where you\\'ll find coffee shops, restaurants, and shopping. We had a great time exploring Ballard, doing the Art Walk and Farmer\\'s Market. We also had a fantastic meal at Ocho, a Spanish tapas place. We had such a great experience at the Ballard Backyard Cottage! Not only was the location and space great, but there is so much attention to detail. Lisa obviously knows what a traveler needs -- especially when traveling with kids. We were so pleased to find things like a step-stool, kid cups, and zip lock bags. We also loved all the local artwork on the walls. We\\'d love to return the next time we\\'re in Seattle. Thanks Lisa and family!  It\\'s been a great stay at the cottage!  The place is in great conditions and very well equipped (specially the kitchen). \\nLisa hosted us wonderfully mailing us before our arrival and providing  a crib and a baby feeding seat, very nice from her. \\nDefinitely I would stay here again my next time in Seattle! This is a newly constructed clean, convenient, comfortable and QUIET\\r\\ncottage. The hosts were very thoughtful in the design and welcoming touches.  This cottage is convenient to downtown Ballard and Seattle buses.\\r\\nWe would not hesitate to book this location again. We arrived late at night to the cottage, and Lisa had left the heat running so it was nice and warm when we arrived.  The cottage was clean and neat and beautiful.  \\r\\nThe kitchen was well stocked with all pots, pans, dishes etc you would need, including a fridge, microwave, an oven, toaster and coffee pot. \\r\\nThe bathroom was stocked with towels, shampoo & conditioner & lotion, soap, and hair dryer and was gorgeously designed.\\r\\nAnd OMG the bed. The bed is a memory foam mattress and sooo comfortable.  It\\'s nicer than my own bed and we slept on a cloud all weekend.  \\r\\nAs for location, it\\'s a few blocks away from a bus stop and about a 1/2 hr journey to downtown Seattle.  It\\'s in a quiet neighborhood and very peaceful.  \\r\\nThis place was great, I highly recommend it, and Lisa was a great host.   Great hosts!  Lisa helped with some on-the-fly instructions to get there by bus.  Sean invited me and my 5.5 yr old over to watch the Seahawks come from behind to trounce the Packers.  Neither of us football fans, but our 5 year olds enjoyed playing together and eating popcorn. Thank goodness I had the good judgment to book this cottage when I did.  For our four night stay, it was perfect; close enough to walk to sweet areas of Ballard or to hop on a bus and explore elsewhere. \\r\\nThe cottage is bright and sunny, open and airy, and feels super clean.  We had everything we needed to get started in the morning (french press=thumbs up), and popping up the bed to let down the breakfast table is a brilliant use of space.  Things just make sense here.    \\r\\nLisa is very laid back, really fun to talk to, and had she and her family not been out of town for the weekend, it would have been lovely to have chatted more.  \\r\\nI felt like we got a really great deal for the price, because everything is so orderly, shiny and new.  The shower is heavenly.  To sum it up, the place left nothing to be desired for us, and when we got some down time to stay in and enjoy it, it was difficult to leave.  I can\\'t wait to come back.  The very cute cat is an additional plus! Lisa was Awesome! We had a family emergency during our stay and they were wonderfully accommodating. We also really appreciated their thoughtfulness to make it toddler friendly. Great location, great space, great people! We had a wonderful stay at the Ballard Backyard Cottage. Lisa and Sean are amazing hosts—they went above and beyond in accommodating our requests, providing information on the area, and making us feel at home in Seattle. The cottage is in a great location, was super-clean, and stocked with everything we needed for our stay (including child-friendly items like a step stool, booster seat, and baby gate). Very highly recommended! The Ballard Backyard Cottage was our base for a week for me and my 2 daughters during spring break.  You couldn\\'t want for more.  The decor and finishes, and local artwork on the walls throughout are very tasteful.  Lisa and family have thought of every detail from comfortable beds and bedding, towels in the bath, and everything you need in a kitchen.   We arrived early, but Lisa said we were welcome to check-in ahead of time.  A nice assortment of food--fruit, carrots, bread, and coffee, and a chocolate bar waiting for us was a nice touch.   Finding parking on the street was always easy.  We appreciated Lisa recommendations in her guidebook.   Highly recommend this charming cottage! This cottage is spectacular! It\\'s pristine, centrally located and stocked with all the necessities. Lisa is an excellent host and made sure we felt right at home. The bed is super comfy too and the separate living room area provides an awesome Netflix respite after a long day of exploring Seattle. I highly recommend this cottage and would stay here again!  Our stay at the backyard tiny home was excellent. The space suited our needs perfectly. We left Seattle refreshed, happy, and inspired. It is a clever little home that makes you rethink how to use space. Our stay at the \"Cottage\" was great. Its locations was ideal for getting anywhere we needed and parking was always available on the street. The one issue we had was addressed immediately. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Lisa was our favourite Airbnb host (are we allowed to say that?). She was friendly, helpful, and she even set out furniture by the cottage so we could catch the morning sun with our coffee. This place is a magic spot in a great location -- a great location for driving/transit/walking around, and Ballard quickly became my favourite neighbourhood. We all agree that we\\'ll never stay anywhere else in Seattle again. You won\\'t regret staying in this beautiful cottage. This was a perfect spot for us, just what we needed to be close to family  in the area.  The cottage was spotless, and had everything as advertised.  Lisa was helpful and available to us.  This is in a neighborhood, and we had no trouble with parking or noise.  Very cozy.  thanks Lisa The cottage is exactly as it looks in the listing. It\\'s clean, neat and though spare, is comfortable. The hostess provides for all your needs. The neighborhood is beautiful - it\\'s about 15 minutes out of the city center. So if you want quiet, comfortable and trendy, you\\'ve found the right place. If you want walking distance proximity to downtown attractions, stay in the center. I liked having the peace of being outside of the center. I would stay there again. We really enjoyed our stay at the cottage! Everything was pristine and comfortable. Lisa was a great host and helped with any questions we had.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also loved staying in such a great part of Seattle - we could walk to many great restaurants, but still had a quiet place to relax at the end of the day. Lisa\\'s place was fantastic! It was very clean, spacious and very creative. We have been travel a lot around the world, we know many places but we are sure we are going to remember this house! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is great! The neighborhood is lovely.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy family and I high recommend this place! Lisa was the best host I\\'ve had since using Airbnb.  She\\'s really nice, welcoming, and has a high attention to detail.  I liked all the Seattle/Ballard artwork in the cottage - it really makes it feel like a home.  The neighborhood is great.  It has a suburban feel, but it\\'s only a few miles from downtown.  Easy to get around by either walking or taking buses.  The cottage has several restaurants within walking distance and there are many more in Fremont and Old Ballard within a short drive.  Overall, it was an awesome trip and we will definitely stay there again if we go back to Seattle! We loved our stay in Lisa\\'s Backyard Ballard Cottage!  The cottage was beautifully designed with everything we needed for our brief stay in Seattle.  Clean, organized, great WiFi connection, very comfortable. Lisa was also incredibly accommodating when we needed to alter our travel plans last minute--thanks Lisa. We had a wonderful stay at the cottage. I spent 5 days with my toddler and the space was perfect for a family. Very spacious, clean and cute. Outdoor space is beautiful as is the neighborhood. Lisa was a great host. She was quick to respond to any questions/needs and incredibly helpful. Also very nice and had many wonderful suggestions for things to do in Seattle and around. Location of the cottage was perfect for a family as there are several beach parks and the zoo within a short drive. We had a rental car and street parking was never an issue. Highly recommend staying at this cottage! Lisa made my first experience renting with AirBnB a pleasure. She answered all my questions quickly and provided some great suggestions on things to do, travel time around town and the state.  The backyard cottage was exactly and described, very neat/clean and ready for us when we arrived. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is great and had lots of places to eat within walking distance. We ate dinner in the neighborhood each night we stayed there.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the street parking for our rental car was very easy/convenient as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly recommend staying in this location if you have the chance, Lisa was a gracious host that gave us our space while balancing the ability to visit with us while we were there. Wir verbrachten drei Tage bei Lisa in Ballard nach unserer Landung in Seattle. Als Familie mit kleinen Kindern fanden wir hier den perfekten Ort zum akklimatisieren, mit Ruhe und Verständnis. Lisa gab uns viele Tipps, die Kinder fanden in Finn einen Spielfreund und bei der Ankunft überraschten uns frische Kaffee-Bohnen in der Küche. Das Häuschen ist sehr praktisch uns stilvoll eingerichtet. Wäre auch ein perfekter Ort für einen Arbeitsaufenthalt mit Schreibtisch, W-LAN und Co. \\nVielen Dank Lisa \\nTräumen schon von einem nächsten mal.  This place is a gem!   We had such a great time.  Lisa and family are awesome and we loved chatting with them as much as we liked their pad.  Great area, super clean and adorable.  Thank you for sharing your place with us! We stayed here for three nights during our mom/daughter trip to Seattle. The Ballard Backyard Cottage was exactly as described and quite perfect for our visit. We especially enjoyed the relaxing outdoor space. Lisa wasn\\'t in town during out stay but she was quick to answer questions when I had them via email. The neighborhood is quite residential but if you don\\'t mind walking, you can easily get to coffee shops and restaurants. I would recommend the cottage to anyone visiting the city, especially families!  This was a great experience. The property and amenities appear exactly as listed. She went above and beyond to make it feel like home. Ballard is a fun little part of Seattle and definately worth checking out. I would absolutely stay here again. Five out of Five Stars! Lisa was extremely friendly, highly communicative, and very helpful. The cottage was immaculate and quiet with many thoughtful touches and helpful details. The cottage was just as described and was perfect for our weeks stay in Seattle. Everything that you could possibly need was provided.  Parking was easy and public transportation to downtown was frequent and quick.  Lisa was a generous & helpful host. She has gone out of her way to make this cottage a wonderful Airbnb experience. Very clean and lovely home with great amenities for our toddler. Cute, friendly cat, too! We absolutely loved our experience staying at the cottage! Lisa was incredibly friendly and welcoming. We had several conversations over the weekend about places to eat and explore. The cottage is in a nice, quiet neighborhood: a short walk to some great bakeries and cafes, and only a 25-minute walk to the Sunday farmer\\'s market. We enjoyed one of our meals out on the patio. The place is spotlessly clean and has a modern feel. We couldn\\'t have asked for a better place or host in Seattle! Also, the cat Buddy is the best.  We had a wonderful week long stay at the cottage! Lisa was an amazing host, she set us up lots of kid/baby supplies so we didn\\'t have to travel with them. The house is immaculate and has all the supplies you need. We particularly enjoyed the comfy bed and wonderful shower. We will definitely try to book this place again the next time we\\'re in Seattle.  The home is exactly as pictured. Quiet, clean, and quite lovely. It\\'s a \"tiny home\" but the use of space is really well situated. We had two people stay in the cottage. One used the upstairs murphy bed and the other used the downstairs futon. It\\'s the most comfortable futon that I\\'ve ever slept on. Don\\'t know what kind of mattress they use, but it\\'s not all lumpy and thin like a lot of futon mattresses. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, Lisa was out of town so we didn\\'t have an opportunity to meet. But she left clear directions in the cottage and gave us some tips through the site before we arrived. She also left some coffee for us to use in the mornings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is great in Ballard. There are a couple breakfast spots that we walked to nearby in the morning. We ubered our way into the city. Cost of travel, depending on time of day and surge, was $10-15 per trip. But I appreciated being in a quiet neighborhood instead of the loud city center.   Lisa\\'s Ballard Backyard Cottage is a perfect place to stay if you love Ballard. Beautifully and quietly placed in a great neighborhood close to some great coffee shops and parks. Lisa was easy to communicate with and made our arrival after a long journey very welcoming. The cottage looked exactly as it does in the photos, plus many nice extras like a comfortable bed and environmental features in the structure of the cottage. Parking was easy if you have a car. \\r\\n Ballard Backyard Cottage is set in a nice and quiet neighbourhood. Lisa was really responsive to enquiries and made us feel really welcome being my first trip to the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nParking is expensive in Seattle and being able to park for free in front of the cottage was really helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cottage itself is fully equipped with everything we need. The rooms are thoughtfully furnished and decorated. Beds were really comfortable too!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Lisa for hosting our trip to Seattle. Our stay couldn\\'t have been better! We arrived late on Thursday night after a long flight from Boston. Lisas house was easy to find and easy to find parking. We walked into a beautiful -very clean home.  The house was perfect .\\r\\n  It was quite and peaceful yet close to the city. This house is nestled in a beautiful setting surrounded by a large inviting deck with very pretty gardens and trees.\\r\\n My husband and I enjoyed watching the three chickens run around next door while having our morning coffee.\\r\\n Thank you Lisa for leaving us all we needed for a fresh healthy breakfast. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. \\r\\nWe look forward to coming back soon and staying at your lovely home again.\\r\\nThank you!\\r\\nChris and John  Lovely neighborhood and very kind hosts.  The house was very well put together and cared for.  Thanks for having us! We really enjoyed our stay in this beautiful little cottage. Lisa is wonderfully friendly and easy to communicate with. The cottage is spotlessly clean and cared for with a particularly comfortable bed - the main things I look for in excellent accommodation. Ballard is a lovely quiet area with coffee shops, a few bars and places to eat. Transport into downtown Seattle is easy and cheap from a nearby bus stop. Great to stay in a quiet residential area whilst still being able to easily enjoy and explore the main city area. Thank you Lisa and Sean. Lisa\\'s cottage was amazing! It provided a great space for me to relax, get some work done, cook a few meals, and get a good night\\'s sleep. Lisa and her husband were very accommodating with my check in times and made it easy for me to get in and make myself at home. The cottage was spotless and well appointed. Location was very easy to get to Ballard or downtown while not having to deal with the hassle of traffic and parking. I highly recommend their cottage and I am already planning to book a return trip! The backyard cottage was awesome! We never met Lisa but had messaged a few times back and forth. When we arrived, her husband said hello and told us to let them know if we needed anything, which we didn\\'t because the cottage was perfect! Super cute!! Easy parking and very close to the cute downtown Ballard bar/restaurant area. I would stay there again.  She was super friendly and met us shortly after arrival. Very accommodating and offered assistance with anything we might need. The place even was stocked with some basic snacks and food items which were perfect for our 4 year old to snack on as we got settled. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cottage is so cute and wonderful. In fact, 1 night stay here and you\\'ll be looking to find a way to build your own! Our stay at the Ballard Backyard Cottage was absolutely lovely. The cottage itself was adorable, well-located, quiet, comfy, impeccably clean and overall perfect for our needs. Lisa was an excellent host and made us feel right at home with yummy chocolate, coffee and champagne waiting for us. We couldn\\'t recommend this little cottage more and will definitely be back. We had such a great stay in Robin\\'s private suite - it is beautifully furnished, spacious, clean and in a fantastic location. We were able to walk about 50 metres to the best pizza (Delancey\\'s) the best bakery (Honore) and the best breaky in Seattle (the Fat Hen) as well as a very cool little bar and a pub. Downtown is an easy 10-15 minute drive or you can walk just around the corner to the D line bus route. We explored a few areas in Seattle but found that Ballard was our favourite - we loved walking through the beautiful green streets down to Ballard Avenue where we found even more of Seattle\\'s best restaurants. In summary - this is exactly the type of Airbnb that we love. Thanks Robin. Robin\\'s home was my first airbnb experience and she was just lovely! She was warm, welcoming and accommodating.  The lower level was clean and private with a full bedroom, living room, bathroom and private entrance. The location was also great! Walking distance to all the unique shops and restaurants in Ballard.  I\\'d recommend Robin to anyone - a great stay! I had an amazing trip to Seattle this past weekend, and Robin played a huge part in my visit surpassing high expectations. \\r\\n\\r\\nHer care started shortly after I booked when she learned I was foodie. She pointed me to insider Seattle food blogs and local restaurateurs, and was quick to answer any questions I might have.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobin was still at work when I arrived, but check-in was seamless and welcoming (she had set out some local chocolate, a city magazine with tips, and thoughtful card…classy touches all).\\r\\n\\r\\nRobin’s house and the Ballard neighborhood were a perfect fit for my weekend. You have the renovated downstairs all to yourself. The apartment is perfect size for a solo traveler or couple. The bed is super comfortable. Cozy sitting area. Great shower in the bathroom. \\r\\n\\r\\nRobin and I were passing ships during our stay, but I did have a chance to sit with her in her lovely backyard one morning. She’s awesome…laid back and super outdoorsy (she went on a night hike one evening during my trip). She has two kids, but I never heard them or saw them. \\r\\n\\r\\nA half-block from her house is a little cluster of restaurants…I had a nice breakfast at the Fat Hen on my last day (try their avocado bread). Walk over to 15th and in a few minutes you’ll be come to my favorite breakfast spot of the trip, Morsel. Big biscuits with overflowing eggs, etc., and homemade jams. Keep walking south (and a little west) and you’ll come to the hub of Ballard at the intersection of Ballard Ave and Market St. Lots of boutiques, restaurants, and bars. FYI, Sonic Boom Records is a must stop for any music lovers. I saw some great bands at the Tractor Tavern. I also walked down to the water further west…beautiful views (be sure to check out the Ballard Locks).\\r\\n\\r\\nOne last recommendation -- while in Seattle, make a point of visiting Westward, a restaurant on Lake Union. They have a small area outside with Adirondack chairs…you can order wine and oysters, then take in the water and downtown Seattle. Transporting. I also had a fun time on the Savor gourmet food tour in downtown Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nTruly an A+ visit. Robin rocks!\\r\\n Although our stay was short and we didn\\'t get to meet the host, we felt very welcome in her home.  Her basement unit is nicely appointed and a great value for the price.  We didn\\'t get to experience Ballard however as we were only in Seattle for 2 days. Wish we could\\'ve stayed longer! Robin was an awesome host! My daughter and I were in Seattle for a wedding. Robin\\'s house in a quiet residential area of Ballard was convenient to the church and reception locations. We stayed 3 nights at her lovely updated, bright and cheery lower level walk out private apartment with its own entrance. Unfortunately we did not meet Robin in person as she was out of town for the holiday week. However, she was very prompt in responding to our questions before and during our trip. Robin was flexible regarding check-in and check-out times. Because it was unseasonably warm she gave us permission to store food and water in the lower level refrigerator of her home. She had a portable fan which we easily moved from bedroom to family room as needed. She has a beautiful private fenced in backyard which we would have loved to use had the weather been nicer. We walked to several nearby places. We got rides from friends or took an Uber when needed. The White Hen (?) restaurant (a block or two from Robin\\'s) was closed for the July 4 week. However, right across the street from this restaurant we discovered a French artesian bakery (Honore) with wonderful baked treats. It was very popular, a tad pricey but the quality of the food was worth it. We picked up breakfast from there every day. We did not try public transport in Ballard but heard it was quite convenient. We would gladly recommend Robin\\'s place to friends interested in accommodations in Seattle. Thanks, Robin! Pat & Laura P. Really enjoyed our 3-night stay at Robin\\'s lovely and comfortable lower level walk-out private apartment with its own entrance.  Robin was really helpful, friendly, informative about the neighborhood, and available while we stayed there; and promptly responsive in planning the visit.   I really liked exploring the neighborhood and area, and as a foodie was happy that good coffee and food was a quick walk away.  This was my first airbnb experience, and glad it was so positive.  Thanks, Robin!! We had a great two nights stay in Robin\\'s comfortable and private space. The location was perfect for us to explore Seattle. The room was clean and welcoming, and the bed was very comfortable. Robin was the perfect host and we could not have been more pleased. Robin was a very welcoming and kind host. She was easy to reach when we arrived and had prepared for us by leaving out a couple of pamphlets about where to eat and sights to see in the neighborhood and greater Seattle, and a small treat to keep us going. The space was well furnished with a TV and DVD player, totally private, and in a great location in Ballard.  My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Robin\\'s! I never got to meet Robin but she was extremely flexible and friendly with all of our emails. You have an entire floor to yourself so if it is privacy you are looking for this is it! The home is next to great restaurants and a 2 min walk from a bus that takes your straight downtown Seattle.  Robin is an ideal Airbnb host and her house is excellently located in Seattle. Perfectly clean, with fresh linens and towels, with a personal note awaiting us on our arrival. This North Ballard neighborhood is beautiful and quiet with super easy access to the main sights of Seattle. We took the bus everywhere. The house is a couple minute walk from the D rapid line in a safe neighborhood. Ample street parking for a car. I highly recommend it! The house was an excellent value at $95 / night. It was roomy for us two, the bathroom is deluxe, you won\\'t regret it! Robin was terrific.  Very welcoming and very helpful with information.   I really didn\\'t spend any time in the neighborhood because I was busy with family some distance away.  That said, it was a welcome refuge to come home to at the end of the day. We had a wonderful three days staying in Ballard! Robin was very helpful and accommodating prior to arriving and when we got there.  The private floor made it easy to come and go often without feeling like we were intruding on Robin.  She suggested many restaurants in the area that we took her up on and absolutely loved! Definitely go to the Fat Hen for a sit down breakfast or grab pastries and coffee from Honore Bakery just down the road from the house! We were visiting Seattle for the first time, so we were on the go pretty much the whole time we were there. We found the location very easy to get to downtown and all of the tourist attractions. There is also a cute overlook park in Ballard that we went to one night to watch the sunset. We had a wonderful time and would recommend Robin\\'s private floor to everyone! We had a great experience here!  The lodging was very spacious and comfortable.  Nice bedroom with comfy bed, living room area with tv, books, and games, and large, spacious well it bathroom.  Robin provided hot tea and coffee.  There was a private entrance.  Extra blankets, a fan, washer and dryer if needed.  Close enough to anywhere you would want to get to in Ballard.  Robin is super nice, accommodating, makes you feel at home.  I would stay here again.   Robin\\'s place was incredible!  She was so on top of everything around our booking, and the place was ready and waiting for us.  It was exactly as she\\'d described it, and bonus the shower is AMAZING!  Ballard is a really cool part of Seattle and we enjoyed our time at the place and in the area very much (especially at the great little breakfast place just down the street.)  We\\'ll be back for sure. Robin\\'s place is awesome.  The accommodations were exactly as described.  Very clean, spacious, and comfortable.  Robin was extremely friendly and gave detailed instructions for check-in/check-out.  The neighborhood itself (Ballard) is a fantastic place to stay- plenty of dining and shopping options.  Downtown Seattle is easily accessible by bus.  So glad I stayed here! Robin was a fantastic host! Check in was incredibly easy. She knew we were coming for a surprise birthday trip for my boyfriend and she left a kind note and a bottle of champagne in the fridge--so thoughtful! The area was lovely, very close to downtown, and other great neighborhood restaurants. Highly recommend!  We had a wonderful time staying in Robin\\'s cozy basement apartment. It was very clean, comfortable, and was the perfect \"home base\" for our activities around Seattle. The check-in and check-out was incredibly easy. The bathroom is fabulous! (What a great shower!) Robin was thoughtful enough to leave some neighborhood information as well as books to enjoy and even a rain jacket and umbrella. Thanks Robin! The place of Robin is situated in the great local residential area of Ballard. We think this is the coolest part of Seattle. Everything was clean and the early check-in was no problem for Robin. She is a very kind host! Down the road there is a small French bakery and \\'The fat hen\\', which was nice for breakfast. We rented bikes at Dutch Bikes in Ballard and another tip is: \\'The Fat Duck\\' for a great bagel (in University district). Conclusion: a great place to stay and explore the local neighbourhood. Taxi to the city center was around $ 21. This was a great experience. The house is located close to the car rental location and a couple good restaurants. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. I work in Seattle frequently for work and it really felt like a home away from home.  Robin did a great job making me feel at home in her spotless lower level apartment in her craftsman home. The listing description was accurate and the neighborhood was lovely and close to many boutique restaurants. I enjoyed the nice welcome letter since she was out of town for the weekend. My son lives in Seattle so I enjoyed going with him to the Sunday Ballard farmer\\'s market. I can \\'t wait to return.  Linda Lawrence We had a wonderful stay at Robin\\'s!\\r\\nA seperate, spacious and light apartment was all we could wish for.\\r\\nAs good as a hotel but felt like home.\\r\\nGreat, quiet neighborhood too. Wish we could have stayed longer...\\r\\nWe recommend it!\\r\\n Our host seemed to have read our minds, knowing certain questions we probably would\\'ve asked her.  She proactively left a map of the neighborhood, showing what shops, eateries, coffee places, gas stations, and grocery/drug stores were close by.  There was a list of important phone numbers, with the wifi code, and instructions on how to use the TV/cable.  Even sweeter, since it was our honeymoon, Robin left a little bottle of wine chilling in the mini fridge!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first night we arrived, we were greeted by the next door neighbor, who was very friendly.  In anticipation of the weather, and knowing that we are from sunny San Diego, Robin also left an extra umbrella and jacket, in case the weather turned during our stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stayed for 3 nights and were mostly out and about.  It was so nice to be able to have a private floor to come back to, to nap or regroup in-between exploring Seattle.  Amazingly, our host lives so close to many of the places we wanted to see.  Most times we didn\\'t have to drive farther than 10-15 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, it was a great first Airbnb experience.  I wasn\\'t sure how interactive it should or shouldn\\'t be, and I think Robin was really gracious about respecting our privacy.  On our last day, we were able to at least say Goodbye and Thank You face-to-face and I really appreciate that we got to do that. Robin was super responsive to check-in details and questions. Her guest space is wonderful--generous sized bedroom, sitting room and bathroom--and private and quiet. Entry/exit is also private and steps away to a walkable neighborhood with trendy restaurants. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will be back in November! This is my second time staying with Robin. She communicates well. The B&B is very clean and quiet. \\r\\nThis B&B is so close to dining options without being in a commercial district. It is quiet and peaceful. I stay here while I am working in Seattle and it really feels like coming home.  Robin\\'s neighborhood was really great. She met us when we arrived and was very friendly. The place was nicely decorated (and she is adding more art as it finds her) and more spacious than we expected. Robin had restaurant suggestions and a local hand drawn map that laid out the neighborhood nicely.  Gotta say- we loved the heated tile floor in the bathroom!  Thanks, Robin! It was a lovely place that was easy to get to and very relaxing to stay. The place is comfy and there is coffee and some tea and a tv with a movie selection. Robin is great to work with. 10/10 would stay here again.  Thank you Robin! My parents loved staying in your home. You made them feel so welcome. It was absolutely perfect for them. This is a great place to stay in Seattle. It\\'s also one of the nicest air bnbs I\\'ve stayed at. Robin is very nice and welcoming. Would definitely recommend!!! Robin\\'s home was an absolute delight! She has amazing taste and we truly felt like we were at home. She greeted us upon arrival and made us feel very welcome. The place was spotless, comfortable and beautifully decorated.\\r\\nThank you for providing us with a beautiful place to stay during our visit, Robin! Very nice appartement, clean, close to public transportation, friendly host.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only tiny issue was that there is no desk, so working is not possible. Brought my husband with me on this visit and we both had a great time in Robin\\'s spacious, quiet apartment--a great place for out-of-town grandparents to spend days with the family and evenings as a couple. We walked the neighborhood, had coffee at Honore Bakery (IMHO the best coffee/tea and pastries in Ballard) and lunch at Un Bien (the Caribbean Roast Dinner is enough for two). As on my first visit, Robin was super responsive and the perfect host. Robin was an excellent host! She made sure we had everything we needed in advance and accommodated a late arrival - she even gave us a heads up about the weather. The apartment is very private and well located, we had no issues going in and out. I would recommend her place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle and I would stay here again.    Clean,comfortable downstairs with really nice bathroom. Great neighborhood, walked to local \"dive\" bar for football. Robin was friendly, helpful and tried unsuccessfully to get the Airbnb app on my phone so I could see complete messages in the future Nice, quiet neighborhood. Robin really made us feel welcome, and answered our questions promptly. No breakfast (instant coffee and an electric kettle) but there were really good restaurants nearby. Darling, newly remodeled, with a wonderful shower and comfortable bed. We had so much fun in Seattle and Robin\\'s place was perfect and exactly what we were looking for. It was a great little neighborhood and a quick easy drive to downtown Robin is a great host. She provides a clean, comfortable, private place to stay in a nice neighborhood. Everything was just as described on the website. She communicates very well and responds to inquiries very timely. She provided us with helpful information about the area that helped us plan our stay. We will  need to return to this area to visit our son and his family and I hope that Robin has a vacancy for us!  Robin is a great host. She sent me very clear instructions about how to access her place and introduced herself to me the first morning of my stay. The space itself is very clean, comfortable, and private. Its a perfect place to rest after a busy day in the city.  She kept in touch before and after our stay that made it a great experience.  We got to meet Robin she made us feel comfortable.  Her place was quiet and in a nice neighborhood.  We would recommend to others. First, would I stay here again - YES.  The room is a little funky because its a converted garage, but its not expensive either.  The bed is most comfortable you will ever find, the bathroom is totally new and very well done, the back yard is lovely, and Amanda is very considerate host.  Stay here. Amanda\\'s apartment is convenient and comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda and her daughter were very welcoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope their room is available when I next need to be in Seattle. Amanda and Luisa were great hostesses. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom and room were clean. I would definitely stay here again. Ballard is a special place and the transportation to get around was easy. The images of the room do not do it justice. It is a large, well furnished room that Amanda continues to improve. It is a very nice, comfortable place to stay with all of the convenience of home. I felt very safe in the neighborhood if you are unfamiliar with the area. There are many local places to eat, shop, and explore in Ballard. Right next door is Freemont, which has even more to offer. An easily accessible bus can take you downtown in 15-20 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda is a great hostess, willing to help out in any way possible. She also knows a lot about the city if you need some help finding things to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was great and made our trip to Seattle easier, more fun, and less stressful because we saved money we would have spent at an expensive hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have absolutely no complaints, our trip was great, thank you very much! Amanda\\'s room was perfect for me.  It was clean and comfortable, cool on a hot day.  Nothing fancy but everything I needed was there.  She even left a plate of cookies to welcome me.  The neighborhood is nice and walkable, Amanda was very friendly and I would definitely stay there again. Amanda\\'s neighborhood was beautiful, quiet, friendly and full of fabulous flowers.  We had everything we needed for a lovely stay- very comfortable bed- great coffee- nice bowl of fruit and very addictive chocolate cake.  Amanda told us about a bakery 3 blocks away, that might be worth the visit all by itself.  Amanda\\'s is not luxurious, except for everything that is important. We were coming to Seattle to pick up relatives from their cruise; the location was perfect because we were able to avoid early morning Seattle traffic. And what a bonus to have such great accomodations.  The room was large and lovely; I felt at home immediately.  Amanda, thoughtfully, had provided a book of Seattle attractions which we used to guide us over to Green Lake and enjoyed a brisk walk around the lake on a gorgeous summer afternoon.  After a late dinner in the U district (but there are two restaurants nearby that we\\'ll try next time) we settled down for the night in bliss -- absolute peace and quiet ...and the most comfortable bed.  I sometimes have trouble falling asleep when I\\'m out of town; not here.  A bite of fresh fruit in the morning, and we were on our way to the cruise ship terminal, rested and refreshed. I\\'d stay here again in a heartbeat. This was a lovely room and bathroom. Totally private, clean and in a lovely neighborhood. Private entrance, and she left us brownies and fruit! Highly recommended. What a great hostess. Amanda was friendly from the first email contact to the last goodbye. The room, a converted garage, was very comfortable. I was greeted with a place of homemade brownies, fruit, and milk in the fridge, a private bathroom full of conveniences, and warm helpfulness.  I was traveling light, so things like extra bathroom items, lotion and shampoo, were especially welcome as was the use of Amanda\\'s washer and drier. There are restaurants and shop within walking distance, and the area is perfect for early morning runs, or walks to pick up a paper. It was also great to see Luisa wearing English World Cup Team socks, and to have my only decent cup of tea on my travels - British people take note! The room and bath had everything I needed to relax and be comfortable after busy days around Seattle. Amanda is very welcoming and helpful. The coffee/tea,fruit, and brownies were nice extras. I was even invited upstairs to watch an early morning soccer match! The room is pleasant and homey and I could read, write, and sleep peacefully. I will go back again. Great place to stay. My stay was brief but Amanda was a wonderful host and great brownies and comfortable bed. My friend and I needed a quiet, well-equipped place to stay for an overnight in Seattle, and Amanda\\'s place fit the bill. Everything was just as described and we were welcomed with a plate of yummy homemade cookies and a fruit bowl. Amanda was friendly and helpful. The room is in the basement and we could hear someone walking above in the wee hours, not really a problem, but might be for some. I would recommend staying here to anyone who wants a comfy, relaxing stay. I went to Seattle for a training at UW (and to write) and  I couldn\\'t have found a better place to stay!  The bed was comfy, the coffee was amazing, the place was very clean (and newly remodeled, including the bathroom), and Amanda and Luisa were incredibly welcoming.  As soon as I walked into the apartment the cheerful, warm vibe hit me (as did the delicious fruit and cookies)!  It is close to two lines of public transport, and within walking distance of several cafes and good restaurants.  I was traveling alone, didn\\'t have a car, and felt totally safe walking the three residential blocks back from the bus stop at 1AM (if you drive, there seems to be tons of street parking).  The yard is gorgeous, and I spent many a morning sipping coffee on the deck.  Amanda and her daughter are both wonderful hosts; they possess a nice blend of laid-back and accommodating.  Amanda teaches elementary school and is very interesting to talk to, and pointed me in the direction of some great things to do in Seattle and Ballard.  (The Ballard Locks/English garden was a nice half-hour walk, and Phinney/Greenwood about fifteen minutes).  The bus to Fremont took less than ten, and my trip to the university was 45 minutes, tops.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEven if I could afford a downtown hotel, it was much nicer to stay here--a \"home away from home.\"  I am already wondering how soon I can plan my next trip back to Seattle and \"Beautiful, Quiet, and Friendly Ballard\"!  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n It was a pleasure to stay in Amanda\\'s home. The room is spacious and cozy and everything you need is available including fresh brownies and fruit! The bathroom is across the hall. I was able to access wifi and enjoyed the \"i-home\" clock. The neighborhood is quiet and residential and fun to walk in. Because it\\'s a former garage it was a little damp but not a problem for me. I appreciated the sense of privacy. GREAT place! Amanda is a wonderful hostess and we felt right at home, especially with her little extras: fruit, Melitta coffee filters & cone, tea, cookies. The bed was very comfortable, and the apartment is modern, clean, with a very nice bathroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is quiet, and close (by car) to downtown Ballard, which is wonderful.  We highly recommend Ray\\'s seafood restaurant, near downtown Ballard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, Amanda is great -- highly recommended!  Thank you, Amanda!\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe & Donna Amanda is an absolute delight, she\\'s helpful and fun, and her downstairs room and private bath are lovely, with everything wished for for a comfortable stay.  And more; I did NOT wish for the brownies but they were yummy.  So thoughtful. \\r\\n\\r\\nLots of parking, public transportation is close by, as are a nice coffee house/bakery, pizza place, great market and assorted restaurants. Perfect! Nice, clean, and pleasant room in which to stay.  Amanda is very welcoming and made us feel comfortable and safe. She even helped us with directions for getting places and suggestions of places to visit. Amanda was great and the room/bathroom was awesome! Very clean! Amanda was also very accommodating on short notice! Would totally stay again if in the Seattle area! Staying with Amanda was awesome.  She is great in responding via email before you arrive.  The room was clean, the bed/bath was private enough for me and my husband, and the extra amenities (washer/dryer, wireless internet, access to the backyard and the quiet family neighborhood) made it seem like home.  Of course, the cookies and fruit she has in the room waiting for your arrival are pretty awesome too.  I highly recommend a stay at Amanda\\'s for any out of towners.   I had such a great experience staying here.  Couldn\\'t have asked for anything more.  The room is spacious and cozy, the bed quite possibly the most comfortable i have ever slept on, and the fresh fruit & cookies a nice treat.  The location is quiet & safe, very close to several bus stops, and a short lovely walk to dowtown ballard.  Amanda is a wonderful host.  In emails as i planned my trip and in meeting her when i arrived she was clear, helpful, and kind.  She has created a wonderful space for travellers to enjoy Seattle from.  Thank you Amanda! My parents stayed with Amanda while visiting. They had nothing but great things to say. Comfy bed, great location. She left fresh baked cookies, fresh fruit, and had extra odds and ends for the forgetful or light traveler. Thank you! My son and I had a wonderful time staying ay Amanda\\'s place. The bed and sofa-bed were both good for sleeping. All facilities were excellent. And Amanda is a terrific host. Fantastic place. The other reviews have covered a lot of the great qualities of both the room and Amanda as a host. Highly recommended and I would love to stay here again if I were in the area. Thanks Amanda! This was a great place to stay.  I felt very safe and comfortable.  There was everything I needed to meet my needs for the week and yes, the brownies were great!\\r\\nJ.S. Amanda\\'s place was so cozy, super clean, quiet and private ~ it was just perfect! She must have put a lot to thought into making the place so nice and welcoming. I also appreciated the herbal tea, organic fruits! I would definitely sign up for future stays when I am in town again! Thank you for being a great host! I was doing a cookery course for 2.5 weeks in Seattle (Oct 2010) and it was important for me to find a place where I could really feel at home and safe whilst there. Amanda\\'s studio was like an oasis of calmness and cosyness with fluffy soft towels, an amazingly comfy bed and a smart newly renovated bathroom (with heated floors!) to boot. And a real sense of privacy since there is a seperate entrance and bathroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda made sure I was looked well after and was full of helpful tips and suggestions. She is also a really wonderful mum and a fun and interesting person to get to know. And her daughter Luisa gives you renewed hope in teenagers - so mature and well-behaved! Looking forward to my next stay already.\\r\\n\\r\\n very nice and comfortable,will recommend to family and friendsm We very much appreciate the thoughtfulness that Amanda put into this nice resting place. It is clean, cozy and quiet. Convenient location.  Thank you for the organic fruits, and healthy beverages! Amanda has created a beautiful, private studio in her basement.  She has thought of everything: homemade brownies when we arrived, refrigerator, microwave, dishes, cutlery, information on Seattle highlights, a very comfortable bed, and heated bathroom floor.  We were able to prepare light meals which is great when you are on the road a long time.  But just around the corner are several restaurants and a great French bakery/coffee bar (some of the best croissants to be had in Seattle).  Amanda was available to answer questions and seems to really enjoy having guests in her home.  I hope we can stay again. We arrived to a cute little garage door adorned with warm yellow tube lights, beckoning us in to a heated refuge with a scrumptious plate of chocolate pecan brownies welcoming us from our late night flight from Chicago. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was as seen in the picture, with more amenities than I had imagined (think mini fridge, water jug, hot water boiler, microwave, plates, mugs, cutlery, weighing scale.. do bring your own hair dryer if you are the type that needs it). The bed was comfortable and the room was well insulated and you can adjust the temperature to your own comfort level. Parking was easy with ample street parking at no cost. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda is no stranger to hosting guests, very responsive with emails, and knew how to prepare important notes in advance, like providing wireless codes and compiling maps and travel brochures on things to do around Seattle and WA. We had an amazing stay with Amanda and would love to come back to live with her again, unless I decide to permanently settle down in Seattle! Our stay with Amanda was short but certainly sweet! She went out of her way to help two girls with very large suitcases find her apartment. As previous guests have said the range of facilities on offer are fantastic and the location is great. Next time we pay a visit to Seattle we\\'ll certainly be seeing if Amanda has availability. amanda is a lovely person and very welcoming. On my arrival there was some delicious brownies waiting for me to gobble up. She lives in a leafy quiet street which was exactly what I was looking for. The bed was incredibly comfortable! I was looking for somewhere quiet that wasn\\'t too far from downtown and this place ticked all the boxes. If I ever go back to Seattle I will surely stay here again! also there is an excellent pho place just around the corner. Amanda was quite simply a wonderful host. She was very responsive to emails and I felt that she was always willing to \\'go the extra mile\\' to make my stay with my six-year-old daughter as enjoyable and pleasant as possible. I would recommend staying at Amanda\\'s place to anyone who is visiting the Seattle area. We had a great week at Amanda\\'s apartment.  Very clean and comfy....will become our home away from home when we visit our grandson.  Walking distance to everything you need. My boyfriend and I stayed at Amanda\\'s studio in Ballard, and hada  wonderful time. Her studio is is comfortable with an AMAZING bed and brand new bathroom, and there were the most delicious brownies waiting for us when we arrived. It\\'s little touches like this that set\\'s Amanda apart and makes for a lovely stay. Her place is very near all the action in Ballard, which is a very cute and trendy neighbourhood.Infact, we only ventured into the city centre once as Ballard has it all. There is a fantastic bakery, pizza place and Mexican within walking distance. I would definitely recommend Amanda\\'s place to anyone staying in Seattle. it\\'s was really nice, comfortable and quiet.  Lovely!  Very warm and friendly...and the most comfy bed ever!!\\r\\n we loved amanda\\'s space in ballard! it was quiet, comfortable, cozy, and private--everything we needed. amanda was such a kind host--super friendly and thoughtful (yummy brownies upon arrival!). thanks amanda for the perfect stay :). i will definitely recommend this place to anyone passing through! Amanda\\'s place is cute and well-cared for. She has two very, sweet cats! My parents stayed at her place while they were visiting me, and they had a great, cozy experience. Amanda is easy to connect with in person and by email and phone. Her home is in a quiet area on a quiet street that is well-located for getting around and enjoying places like Ballard and Fremont (neighborhoods in Seattle). Friendly decor, homemade cookies as a greeting and wireless internet made our stay really enjoyable. Amanda was a friendly host and her space was clean, well-located,  spacious and fairly comfortable.  Lots of people haved raved about the bed which perhaps inflated my expectations; I found it to be pretty  standard (however I did appreciate that it was placed to allow access from both sides).  The only caveat is that due to its basement-location, it can be slightly musty (even with the windows open), so if that is an issue for you it might not be the best fit (however I am admittedly rather hyper-sensitive to that sort of thing so it is probably fine for most people).  The garden is lovely and there was plenty of light from the windows; it doesn\\'t feel like you are in a basement since the door opens into it from the front yard.  Amanda was easy to talk to and had great recommendations for local eateries.  She also very considerately left a lovely bowl of fruit for us to enjoy when I mentioned that we would prefer not to have brownies or cookies in the room.  Thanks Amanda! Amanda\\'s was perfect for our weekend in Seattle!  Ballard is a great neighborhood.  The place as warm, welcoming and had everything we needed!  Thanks Amanda.  We\\'ll definitely be back! Amanda\\'s house is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood in Seattle.  We had no problem getting around using public transportation (there are bus stops within a couple blocks), although in retrospect it would have been nice to have a car.  Easy check in and lots of little touches, like a variety of teas and brownies upon arrival, made this a wonderful stay.   Amanda\\'s home is beautiful and in a wonderful location. She provides comfy touches to your stay and the room/bathroom are very clean and neat. I hope to return soon! We had a great time staying at Amanda\\'s. Clean, comfortable, private and  super handy to Ballard. Recommended! We spent 8 days sightseeing and each night looked forward to a restful sleep in a very comfortable queen-size bed.  It was truly a pleasure to stay at Amanda\\'s:  she\\'s a great hostess and I have to agree with other reviewers that she makes the best brownies ever!  I know we\\'ll plan another visit.....thank you, Amanda! Clean and comfy – everything you need is provided for you.  Lots of drawers, as well as a closet for hanging items (hangers included).  Wonderful bed, lots of pillows, extra linens and towels also provided.  Room was originally the garage (under the house), now finished off very professionally.  Newly added bathroom (with heated tile floor) is a few steps away in the unfinished basement.  Washer/dryer/iron & ironing board also in the basement, and Amanda generously offered to let me use them.  Beautiful yard and back deck, vegetable garden, quiet street, lovely neighborhood, ample parking.  All the great reviews are true, and the best part is Amanda – a wonderful friend and terrific host! Quiet, clean, mellow location and space.  Slept like a rock each night after I taught class all day.  I arrived to a fresh bowl of fruit and yummy brownies. She has organic coffee in the room, wi-fi. cable and a clean bathroom with a heated floor.  I only saw her once during the entire stay.  Fabulous. Very comfortable (the bed was particularly good), clean and quiet, with extra touches that made my stay in Seattle so good. Amanda was a wonderful host: friendly, respectful and very helpful. Highly recommended.  Amanda was a great host and was extremely organized and helpful the entire time. When I arrived, she had delicious brownies ready along with instructions for everything in the apartment. I also changed plans at the last-minute and had a friend stay with me as well, and she was more than happy to accommodate. I highly recommend staying here as it\\'s a great place and Amanda is an awesome host. Large, spacious accommodation, well equipped with attention to detail, in a charming quiet neighbourhood, within walking distance to supermarket and bus stops. Amanda went out of her way to make me feel comfortable. My best airbnb experience so far. Amanda is the most wonderful and thoughtful host!  We stayed there for 8 days with our two year old and that was the best accommodation experience we had in our two month trip.  Very kids friendly, and Amanda even left some toys and books out for us.  Very clean and comfortable room and bathroom.   Will definitely stay there again.\\r\\n\\r\\n We had a great time staying in Amanda\\'s home. It was really like a home away from home. We arrived to brownies and a bowl of cherries! There\\'s a hairdryer and shampoo and even tampons in case you find yourself in that situation. Tons of closet and drawer space, and even an iron to press your clothes. There was always parking on the street and the neighborhood is very cute. If I ever return to Seattle I would definitely consider staying here again. The price is certainly right for all that you get!  Great little spot.  The bus is not far.  It is like you have your own apartment.   Just needed to stay near Ballard as we were heading to the wonderful downtown area for dinner while passing through the area. Amanda\\'s place was perfect.  Clean, comfortable, private  and quiet. Would definitely stay again if in the area. Amanda\\'s apt was exactly as described and her brownies are perfect.  She has everything you could need and the place is immaculate and very comfortable.  We had a brief stay at Amanda\\'s place, but it was great all the while. We were so glad Amanda allowed our late check-in as we were just coming in town from a late flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place is welcoming and for such a small little space, it is well-equipped for guests. We appreciated the fresh fruit and treats that were left for us. In addition, the place is very clean and looks like it has been recently renovated.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, it was calm and private just what we needed after a long flight and one of us being ill!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for letting us stay at your lovely space! A very welcome alternative to hotels.  Quiet, clean, comfortable - great \\'welcome\\' brownies!  The only trick is the on-street parking.  If you rent a car for your visit, make sure it\\'s a small one. We had a very relaxing weekend staying here. Perfect location.  Wonderful cozy room with all that you need.  The location was great, close to Ballard and a great coffee shop.  We loved being able to water the garden and have fresh veggies and dahlia\\'s ia in our room.  Amanda was super friendly, even though we only got to meet her at the end of our stay.  We will definitely be back and have already referred a friend to stay there!!  Thank you What a great little space! I arrived to fresh fruit, flowers & home made brownies! A perfect space to have a home away from home with all of the amenities. Amanda was a fantastic host & made my first airbnb experience a super postive one, looking forward to returning! Amanda\\'s place was perfect for us.  Quiet neighborhood with plenty of parking.  A great location with many places to go eat or grab a cup of coffee.  She was very friendly and her brownies were delicious.  The flowers and bowl of fruit were a wonderful touch to the room.  Thank you Amanda for making our stay very comfortable and feel like home.  Apartment was very cosy and comfortable and the neighbourhood peaceful. Two bus stops nearby with an easy distance to downtown. For some Ballard might be too distant from downtown but if you like to stay in a residential area and experience more than just tourist attractions - it\\'s the perfect spot.  We had a very pleasant stay at Amanda\\'s while visiting our daughter in Seattle. Well supplied, clean and comfortable accommodations.  I enjoyed a comfortable 3 day stay at Amanda\\'s B&B.  The location was perfect for me and close to coffee shops and bus lines.  She offered the use of her deck and back yard in addition to the B&B space provided.  \\r\\nshe is a friendly and knowledgeable host.  Amazing brownies!   I\\'ll stay there again on my next visit to Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nJim DeFreitas Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful experience staying here!!! Amanda was soooooo nice, warm, and respectful. The perfect host. The room is exactly as it is pictured - lovely, clean, and welcoming. The Ballard neighborhood is great - good food and a nice yoga studio downtown. Ideal for folks who do not want to get tangled up in the traffic and noise of downtown. Would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Seattle. (FYI - Amanda bakes killer brownies!!!)  This home is comfy, cozy, and exactly as advertised. Great place to stay if you are wanting to be near the action but not in the heart of downtown, only 5 min from historic Ballard & 15 min from Pike Place Market. Two thumbs up! Amanda was a great host and we had a great time at her place. She also baked us warm muffins, Thanks Amanda What is not to like? The location is outstanding, within walking distance of everywhere you will want to go and everything you will want to see. The hostesses are superbly kind, very welcoming and incredibly accommodating, helping us make sure the space would work for our two-year old daughter who would sleep in the portable crib we brought for her (and who historically has not done well sleeping in the same room as us - they gave as what we needed to put up a little \"wall\" made from a bed sheet). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment is comfortable, well-appointed and clean. The bed is cozy, firm but not hard with a super comfy comforter. The bathroom is clean and adorable, and we wanted to spend more time in it just hanging out (gotta love those radiant heat floors). The welcome brownies and fruit bowl were a really nice additional touch. We cannot wait to go back; our two-year old talks about the Seattle apartment all the time. Thanks so much for having us! What a nice surprise this gem was. Amanda and Luisa have clearly thought through every aspect of providing a refuge for travelers.  Clean to a fault, my usual slovenliness stood out in sharp contrast to the meticulousness of the accommodations.   I\\'ll not indulge in the effusiveness of my full gratitude lest I make this place never available again.  Nevertheless, highest recommendations.   We got to stay at Amanda\\'s 4 nights. The room was nice and clean, she had extra ammenities that you wouldn\\'t get at a hotel, easy to find, lots of great food and entertainment in the area, communication was GREAT. We are Very Grateful! she is such an awesome host! Very helpful and the place was exactly what we were looking for. It is in a quiet neighborhood yet close to almost everything you need to get started/setup. Great place, great host. Happy to have found it.  I booked a stay for my parents who visited for the holidays. Amanda was excellent with all communications. After their weary late night arrival they were greeted with a well lit walkway, seamless check-in, and decadent brownies.  They stayed for a week,  enjoyed all the amenities, and request to stay here when they visit again.  Amanda was an excellent host and incredible individual. The basement floor had a great amount of privacy and quiet to match a peaceful residential neighborhood. Amanda clearly enjoys the process of hosting, making your stay warm and memorable. Amanda was great! She had everything I could possibly need, plus brownies! Amanda was the perfect host! She was very friendly, uncomplicated, helpful and diligent. We even found an ice scraper on our car after a frosty night! Her home is located in a charming neighbourhood, not far away from Green Lake, which is well suited for exercise and relaxation. Hopefully we will be meeting each other again!\\r\\nKlaus & Esa\\r\\n We couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to stay for our weekend in Seattle. The \"apartment\" was very cozy and comfortable and Amanda was a great hostess. Ballard is now one of our favorite areas in Seattle and Amanda\\'s recommendations in town did not dissapoint!\\r\\nWill definitely stay here again for our next visit. Amanda Guyler...  what a wonderful being and thoughtful host.  My best airbnb experience, thus far.  The apartment is C-L-E-A-N and cozy.  The bed is \"off-the-charts\" comfortable.  The brownies are from the place in heaven where angels just bake brownies all day!!  =)    Amanda\\'s apartment is a wonderful way to begin and end your days in Seatlle.  I happily and highly recommend. Amanda is great. She made brownies, her place is clean, well decorated, completely comfortable, conveniently located. Will book this again and recommend it without hesitation. Wonderful weekend in Ballard at Amanda\\'s house! Amanda was so sweet and her place was relaxing and beautiful! Would definitely stay again! Amanda\\'s charming suite was lovely. She was very accomodating and baked some great brownies! very comfortable spot, and perfectly located for activities in Ballard, Fremont, Phinney Ridge Great stay--clean and comfortable, perfect value, nice neigborhood, easy parking, and I had everything I needed plus some!  The separate entrance/key allowed for plenty of privacy, but I was still glad that I got the chance to talk with Amanda and get to know her for a bit as well.  Amanda was very friendly, and she had excellent recommendations for a great place (Sunset Hill Park) to go for a walk during the unexpected sunny afternoon in Seattle.  Thanks so much for everything! Very nice and comfortable. We will be back for sure.\\r\\nThanks!, Great-- clean, cozy, and came with brownies!\\r\\nThanks Amanda! Living at Amanda\\'s place was a great experience. Though the weather was terrible, it was warm and cozy at Amanda\\'s place. We met some problems during our stay, but Amanda was really helpful. The house is located at a quiet neighborhood, which is not far away from downtown. Love this experience!  Our first Airbnb experience was wonderful! We spent eight days in gorgeous Seattle (and it really was gorgeous - beautiful weather!). Amanda was a fantastic host. We had yummy brownies and fruit waiting for us when we arrived. We were able to use the washer and dryer in the basement, just a few steps outside of our room. That was a huge help for us and really cut down on the amount of clothing we packed for our trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was the perfect size for us - all three of us (two adults and one child) had plenty of room to spread out. There was definitely ample storage - two dressers, one desk, two nightstands, and a large closet with room for shoes, luggage and hanging clothes (hangers included!).\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth beds (the queen bed and pull-out love-seat) were very comfortable. I never sleep well my first night away from home, but I slept like a baby on the very comfy queen bed. My husband\\'s contribution to this review: The heated floor in the bathroom was awesome!!! Oh, and the water pressure in the shower rocks!\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving a refrigerator and microwave in the room was definitely a plus! They were both put to good use with leftovers from Delancy (fantastic pizza place - try the bittersweet chocolate chip cookie with gray salt for dessert) and Honore (delightful bakery - try everything). We had no leftovers from The Fat Hen, but we did eat brunch at a table next to Penn Badgley and Zoe Kravitz! We quite enjoyed having such excellent dining options within easy walking distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, we had a wonderful experience. Great host, great room, great neighborhood, great city! great hostess, great neighborhood We chose Amanda\\'s rental because it was in the same neighborhood as our friends that we were visiting. Now that we have stayed there, I would choose it just because it is an amazing place to stay! We arrived to a cute, newly remodeled, very clean room with yummy homemade brownies awaiting us! Amanda chatted with us on several occasions and we hope to visit this wonderful guest again! The location was perfect for us. The neighborhood is lovely and quiet with lots of parking available in addition to her driveway. We rode our bikes to the Burke-Gilman trail and rode for hours. We ran to the zoo and around Green Lake which was beautiful. Thank you Amanda for everything! I have been to Seattle a few times before, but always for work. This time my fiance and I got to do some proper exploring. Starting with Amanda\\'s neighborhood. Ballard is amazing! So glad we chose her guestroom. High in the hills, Ballard is really charming and its clear that those who live there understand what a great spot they have. Mountain views and lush foliage are everywhere. As well as many local independent shops and restaurants. Amanda recommended the local bakery Honore and it was amazing. Macaroons to go for the plane ride home and the best croissant I\\'ve ever had. And speaking of tasty baked goods, when we arrived at Amanda\\'s, there were fresh brownies waiting for us. We ate them immediately, of course, and they were excellent. No doubt we will stay there again whenever we visit Seattle again. Which will hopefully be soon. We had a great time. Thanks Amanda and Luisa. Amanda was an excellent hostess.  Her space was comfortable, cheerful, and had everything I needed.  I would love to stay there again. My daughter and I arrived late to Amanda\\'s place and what a joy it was to feel welcomed by some warm lights at the entry and some home made brownies awaiting us inside. We were a little road weary so the thoughtfulness was even more appreciated! We found her place easily - even in the dark!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe suite is welcoming, clean and nicely appointed. I would stay again any time we are in Seattle again! Had a lovely stay at Amanda\\'s this past weekend. Clean, comfortable, quiet. Location is super walkable to Delancey\\'s for pizza, Fat Hen for breakfast, Honore for French treats and, with a little longer walk, anything in downtown Ballard.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonestly, you can stop searching for your Ballard apartment and go ahead and book Amanda\\'s. Amanda\\'s place is clean, comfortable, inviting, and private.  It is within walking distance to a bus that will take you downtown in about 15-20 minutes depending on traffic.   You can also walk to some shops and a delicious bakery!  This is a wonderful option if you want to stay in a quiet area, take some walks in the neighborhood and get a good night\\'s rest.  There is also a refrigerator and a nice big desk.  The water pressure in the shower is very nice, too.  It\\'s clear to me that Amanda knows what a traveler needs and has thought carefully about the organization of her space, and what to include in her space-- (the alarm clock was very helpful, the shampoo and conditioner, the hair dryer, etc.).  I would stay here again.   Amanda\\'s place was very nice and comfortable, and she was a great host. Since I didn\\'t spend much time there I never actually ran into her, but she left a nice note with instructions and a place of brownies! Very quiet, private, and spacious room.  Amanda was a terrific host and her place is warm and welcoming.  Thanks for that awesome assortment of fruit and the amazing brownies.  Loved staying there! Wonderful neighborhood.  Spring is breathtakingly beautiful in Ballard.  The apartment was so clean, and newly and attractively finished.  Amanda is a warm and gracious host.  We enjoyed wine on her large deck with friends.  Great to have laundry facilities too.  Note to those who need darkness to sleep: the eastern exposure is bright very early in the morning in May.  I hung our coats on hangers on the door and window frames to give us a few extra hours of sleep.  We didn\\'t have a car and there were two bus lines that stopped very nearby - very convenient.  Would definitely return.  Thanks! Amanda\\'s place felt like a fully furnished studio apartment. The location is within walking distance to all of the unique things to see in Ballard. Amanda gives wonderful privacy and the room is very cozy, clean and homey. Parking was never a problem, as the driveway is always available. I would definitely stay here again. This was a very comfortable room in a quiet neighborhood.  The owner was very accommodating.  Yes, there were the brownies and yes I ate them all.  A plus for me was the nice bathroom with a tub. Cozy, charming, welcoming...wonderful! Great house, great neighborhood. Amanda is very sweet! And the heated bathroom floors were incredible too.  Amanda has a very clean and comfortable downstairs bedroom that comfortably aoccommodated my two daughters and myself. The privacy was appreciated and Ballard was a great neighborhood to be in. It was close to a beautiful park where we jogged each morning and the bus to Seattle was close by and convenient. My daughters loved the home made brownied that Amanda left for our arrival at night, so it is a great place to stay. A really good  place to stay with a wonderful host who was extremely helpful and kind. Highly recommended. Amanda is very nice and very accommodating. On top of offering us her comfy, cozy and private studio apartment, she placed a plate of homemade brownies and a welcome note in the room! :)  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis place was a perfect homebase for our 4-day stay in Seattle!  We were able to get to and from all parts of the city quickly.  It is nicely stocked with everything you might need. As parents of a young baby, we especially appreciated having access to a washer and dryer!    We had a wonderful time!  Andy and I were in Seattle for his first visit.  We loved the quiet neighborhood and the hospitality.  It was so great to sleep in, go for a run, have a shower in a super-clean bathroom, and feel like we were a young couple in a cute neighborhood.  A nice place sets such a tone for a trip! A lovely quiet place to stay. We were greeted with a plate of  the now famous Amanda brownies, a bowl of fresh fruit and were able to savor some off the the peas and lettuces growing in the garden during our stay (yummy). It is a nice quiet and friendly neighborhood with the #28 bus to downtown (20/25 minutes) just a few blocks away made getting into the city ideal. It stops near the Seattle Center, Pike Market, Pioneer Square and easy to connect with the light rail system. While we didn\\'t have much of a chance to sit and chat with Amanda she is a vary warm and friendly host and took care of anything we might have needed. It was a great visit to Seattle made even better by our stay at Amanda\\'s place Amanda was a fantastic host! The place was pristine and beautiful, just as described. She had every amenity conveniently located in the room with complete privacy. Amanda shared lots of useful Seattle knowledge and encouraged us to reach out to her if we needed anything. Highly recommend and will definitely stay with her again when I\\'m back in the Seattle area!  My mom and I took a short vacation to Seattle and decided to go with this beautiful studio. I love the neighborhood.  Amanda is a great host!! She pays close attention to  the fine details and was very helpful with any of our needs. I will definitely be visiting someday again and will look to stay with her! Fantastic location - quaint, stylish, coffee shops, bakery, breakfast joints! Amanda was an incredible host and was very accommodating to our two year old. Close enough to Seattle but just far enough away from the hustle and bustle. We enjoyed Green Lake, the Fremont Troll, the Ballard locks and much more, all which were a couple miles away. I would recommend her place in a heartbeat and will definitely think about her place for our next trip to Seattle. You will not be disappointed.  A charming place to stay in Ballard.  Very cozy and nicely decorated.  We had everything we needed Amanda is good and gracious host and the apartment very comfortable. And the location is excellent/quiet neighborhood. It was great staying with Amanda...I felt like I was at my daughter\"s home!  Everything was clean and pleasant with many small amenities that you couln;t get in a hotel..And of couse..there were Brownies  The room was lovely and very private.  We arrived to a plate of home made brownies.  Amanda was a very nice host. Amanda is the most gracious host. We thouroughly enjoyed staying at her beautiful apartment. It\\'s comfy, clean and has everything one might need. The perfect hub from which to explore Seattle. \\r\\nAnd yes, her brownies are to die for.  Amanda\\'s the perfect host!  Our stay at Amanda\\'s beautiful apartment was overwhelming. She is the perfect host, welcoming and helpful with advice on all aspects that travellers might need to find their way around the neighborhood and the city. The description of the apartment is fully accurate, everything is tidy and cozy. And there is even a brand new huge flat screen TV with HD (although you probably won\\'t find much time to use it, since there is so much to discover in the area). A highlight for us was sitting in Amanda\\'s backyard and just watch the day go by in this quiet surroundings. Thank you so much, Amanda! Our stay with Amanda was absolutely perfect. She greeted my girlfriend upon arrival, and offered to move her car in order to make space for ours in front of her house. We were welcomed with a beautiful, cozy room with a new swiveling flat-screen tv, homemade brownies, and all of the amenities a hotel would never provide (toothpaste, advil, tea, kettle, microwave, fridge). We also asked for a wine/bottle opener and Amanda provided us with one almost immediately. She was an amazing host with a beautifully-located house. Our first Airbnb experience was wonderful and I would recommend Amanda\\'s place to anyone visiting the Seattle area. Hopefully we\\'ll be back! The location of Amanda\\'s place is great and the place itself is very cute, quiet and private... She left peaches from her neighbour\\'s yard and slices \\r\\nof fresh zucchini bread out for us (a nice touch!!) and the best part was that she was able to accommodate us even though if was fairly last minute. \\r\\nThe bed was very comfortable and there\\'s wi-fi and a tv with lots of channels. ... my husband and I were on an overnight trip to Seattle and we \\r\\nwanted to stay in Ballard... it was our first Air BnB experience and we were very happy. All in all Amanda\\'s place is highly recommended... Thanks Amanda !! Amanda\\'s place is so cute and homey.  There were even fresh homemade zucchini bread and peaches from a neighbor\\'s tree waiting for us when we arrived in the evening!  Amanda kept good communication before and during our trip via airbnb messages.  I felt safe and welcome here and would love to come back.  (All this, despite not even meeting Amanda!  Unfortunately, our timing did not align, and I was busy during the weekend I stayed there with a wedding and related festivities.) This place was in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood of Seattle. Fruit trees and vegetable gardens everywhere. Close to public transportation to get downtown and within walking distance of coffee shops and restaurants. The bedroom was beautiful (nicer than a lot of hotels we stayed in) and we had access to laundry, a refrigerator and Amanda\\'s backyard. Amanda was super nice and helpful. I highly recommend this place to anyone that like low key and city city environments. Nice comfortable room with all the amenities in a quiet neighborhood.  From the moment I walked in, it was clear why Amanda is a Superhost: fresh cut flowers from her garden were in a vase on the desk beside a plate of fresh-baked homemade brownies and a handwritten personal note welcoming me.  Wow!  Add to that a spotless, cozy, welcoming room, a meticulously kept bathroom, fresh towels laid out, a pitcher of filtered water, and instructions on how to make myself at home noting everything from wifi information to instructions on how to adjust the temperature of the heating floor in the bathroom and more... it was clear Amanda had thought of everything.  This turned out to be true with every aspect of my stay: check-in + out couldn\\'t have been easier, the bed was very comfortable, and Amanda was incredibly responsive.  Her place is exactly as described and pictured, and that\\'s a good thing.  What\\'s more, the neighborhood is charming - definitely check out historic Ballard if you get a chance - and a quick walk to a bus stop that\\'ll take you right downtown, making it very accessible.  All in all, a terrific stay, no downsides whatsoever.  I *highly* recommend Amanda and her place!   We had a great stay and really appreciated the fantastic job Amanda has done with this space.  It is exactly as portrayed in the photos and very clean.  Ballard is a great neighbourhood and we were easily able to access public transport.\\r\\nWe really enjoyed the advice Amanda gave us on places to visit and the brownies and plums she gave us during the week.  While Amanda was regularly around to ask for advice we also had complete privacy when we wanted it.\\r\\nAs travellers on a seven week trip we also really appreciated being able to wash and dry our clothes easily. Very comfortable space. Clean and quiet. My Husband and I love Seattle and Amanda’s place was great – everything as we imagined. We arrived to fresh cut flowers in a vase & plumbs from her garden and a plate of homemade brownies. Amanda had also left us a welcome note explaining all the details. There was also fresh towels laid out for us and a pitcher of filtered water. The fridge & microwave sure came in handy as did the use of the washing machine & dryer. Amanda’s place was exactly as described and I would not hesitate in recommending her place and Ballard. It’s a great location.  Amanda\\'s studio was perfect for our nine-day stay. It was easy to get to, was spotless inside, and had everything we needed. When we first walked in, a plate of brownies, fresh-cut flowers, and a sweet note from Amanda greeted us. Amanda opened her lovely backyard for our pleasure, and made some nice recommendations for lunch and dinner. By the way, go to Delancey for artisan pizza and The Fat Hen for a dish of baked eggs (both around the corner)! Overall, if you want a quiet, clean, and easily accessible studio, come here! Wonderful, well appointed room (even got to watch Barça - Real Madrid in HD!) that was quiet and cozy.  Amanda was warm and welcoming, making it the most pleasant experience to spend a few nights away with our little 7 months old along for the ride! Amanda\\'s place is awesome! When we arrived, we were greeted by a fresh plate of delicious brownies and a friendly note from our hostess. The accomodations were clean, quiet and easily accessible with plently of street parking. My wife and I could not have found a better place to stay during our visit to Seattle. This is my favorite place to stay in Ballard.  Amanda\\'s basement apartment has everything I need and she is a gracious host. Sweet little studio, with super comfy bed and towels, fresh flowers, and brownies waiting for us. Amanda was easy-going and made it easy to book and stay there! We could even park in the driveway, what a treat! Loved it. There is nothing that I can write that will say what hasn\\'t been said about Amanda\\'s guest suite by the previous 131 reviews!  Yes, read that again, 131 reviews.  Amanda came to my rescue when I experienced a hiccup in my travel, and in the cold Seattle night, she called me to work out a plan, which made me feel welcomed and supported.  Amanda is absolutely down to earth, mellow, thoughtful of a host - Awesome communication, awesome interaction, awesome outcomes.  131 reviews, ok? We wish we could give Amanda 10 stars!  The apartment was clean, well furnished and had sweet little personal touches that can\\'t be beat!  When we arrived we were greeted with beautiful flowers from her garden and a plate of amazing brownies! There was a little holder that had organic teas and coffees and an electric water heater for a quick cup of warmth.  A mini fridge proved useful as well (do you know how many hotels DON\\'T have a mini fridge these days?!?)  She lives within walking distance (5-10 minute stroll at most) of wonderful little local restaurants and is close to anything else you might need.  Amanda also let us park in her driveway which was wonderful because we learned we aren\\'t good street parkers :) Oh, and the use of her washer and dryer was great so I didn\\'t have to go home with 5 days of dirty clothes!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got to talk to Amanda a few times as well and her hospitality, kindness and knowledge of local places is great! I text her a few times during our stay to find out where something in particular was and she always promptly responded with exactly what we wanted to know.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall I would highly recommend her sweet little apartment to everyone I know!  Great spot, easy to find, and the best brownies were awaiting for us as we came in out of the rain.  We ate \\'em before dinner.  Amanda was prompt in responding to the reservation request, I spoke with her directly over the phone, she was very accommodating to any of my requests.\\r\\nThanks, Amanda. Yep, it\\'s great! Read the other reviews, add them up and it equals awesome. \\r\\nEverything is as advertised - even the cleanliness! I am perhaps a bit OCD about cleanliness (clutter -not so much) but the place was immaculate, even the bathroom. (Side note: the heated floors in the bathroom are such a wonderful addition. Didn\\'t know I was missing them until Amanda\\'s place).\\r\\nUnfortunately it was such a busy weekend that I didn\\'t get to meet Amanda or Luisa but they made it so easy and wonderful.\\r\\nWe also loved walking to the Fat Hen for breakfast one morning: the egg bakes are simple and delicious.\\r\\nAnd of course the brownies are amazing, particularly after a long day of travel. :) We loved our stay at Amanda\\'s!  The room was comfortable and had everything we could possibly have needed.  VERY comfy bed.  We were there for only a very short time, but it was the perfect place to stop to catch our breath and relax a bit.  Looking forward to staying again sometime soon when we return to Seattle for a longer visit. :)   All was as expected. \\r\\nGreat neighbourhood. \\r\\nDelicious brownies awaiting us in the room.\\r\\nClean bathroom and comfortable bed. \\r\\nGood value for the money.\\r\\nThank-you  Amanda\\r\\n\\r\\nVictoria BC We had a lovely time at Amanda\\'s. She was very warm and welcoming. There were even fresh brownies (yummy) and a New York Times waiting for us! We appreciated all the little amenities -- like toothpaste, shampoo, and conditioner in the bathroom. And fresh coffee in the morning. The studio is very cozy, clean, quiet, and private in a charming neighborhood. We hope to stay there again soon! We had a great weeklong stay at Amanda\\'s place. We came and went as we pleased and had access to just about anything we could need. She\\'s really got a great downstairs suite going on...and I\\'m loving the heated bathroom floor:) Amanda is obviously a very experienced and talented hostess. Just returned from a 3 day stay at Amanda\\'s in Ballard and I think the delicious brownies we\\'re solely responsible for averting the Mayan\\'s predicted apocalypse.  The space is warm,private and cozy and she\\'s a very thoughtful host.  I hope her place is available the next time I come to seattle. My wife and I chose this location because of its closeness to our daughter\\'s house. We loved the heated floor in the bathroom.  We were there for a week. It was convenient to have a mini fridge, a microwave, an electric water pot for making tea and coffee. The location was nice and made it easy to get around. Nice neighborhood, lots of restaurants, Walgreens and Safeway close by. We will definitely stay again at Amanda\\'s when we visit Seattle next time. We highly recommend her place.\\r\\nLew and Marie\\r\\nJanuary 2013 Amanda\\'s place in Ballard is great.  The location was easy to find and her space is just as you see pictured.  We only spent one night, but we enjoyed our brief stay and had all the amenities we needed.  Amanda was prompt with all communications.   Amanda\\'s place in Ballard is incredibly charming!! We were greeted with a warm, welcome note and delicious treats upon arrival :-).  Amanda was very hospitable and checked-in to see if her guests were well!  We definitely enjoyed the soft, mint decor of the studio space and great amenities such as the microwave & kettle, a lovely selection of teas, mini fridge, wifi access, and widescreen cable television.  Other perks included a great desk & lounging area, a lovely double bed, and a charming bathroom with laminate floor heating :-).  We highly recommend booking Amanda\\'s place for your next trip to Seattle!! We found our \"apartment\" to as advertised. It was far more then just renting a place to stay.  Clean, roomy, comfortable, and convenient to everything.  We will stay again. Cute little apartment, comfy bed.  Amanda was very communicative and everything was well organized.\\r\\nAlso the brownies were delicious!!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'ll be back Amanda\\'s comfy nest was a perfect home away from home in Ballard. The room was spotless, warm & cozy, and well-equipped. She makes delicious brownies, and the shower is stocked with the most amazing smelling shower gel.  This is a really lovely, cozy, quiet space next to a wonderful Seattle neighborhood. Amanda was a great host, very accommodating to our check in/check out schedule, and even made us brownies (which were delicious)! The bed is really comfortable and the room has all the conveniences of a hotel. Parking was easy (there\\'s a driveway) and the main drag of Ballard is only a 5-10 minute drive away or a nice 20-30 minute walk. We would definitely stay here again! We had a delightful stay in this location.  Amanda was a gracious host, calling to ensure we knew where to get the key because she wasn\\'t home.  She left us a plate of delicious brownies upon our arrival.  It is a very walkable and delightful neighborhood.  The room was exactly as the pictures, and the heated floor in the bathroom was great.  We rode the train up so we didn\\'t have a car, but the bus transportation gets you downtown in about 15 minutes.  Overall great stay. Amanda\\'s place was awesome! The room was very nice and the bed was super comfortable! She responds quickly and is very accomodating. The brownies are just the cherry on top! We definitely recommend this place! Amanda\\'s place was awesome. It was super cozy, quiet and had all the conveniences of home. I would for sure stay there again! We absolutely loved our time in Ballard at Amanda\\'s place! We arrived at the apartment in the middle of the night and were met by a beautiful apartment and a much-welcome plate of brownies! We met Amanda in person the next day and she was very helpful in recommending local restaurants, markets and the best bits of Seattle to see. Ballard is a lovely area and Amanda is a lovely host, we would definitely recommend her place to visitors to Seattle! This place was exactly as advertised. Amanda was an excellent host. My family had an excellent stay. Comfortable, clean and neat place. Liked  the decoration, with just the right touch of the cozy american style. Appreciated a lot the home made brownies and note as welcome. And everything was here for any hot beverages.\\r\\nCould be a bit far from dowtown if no means of transport, but not a problem with our rental car. And very well localized for a family visit to the near beautiful zoo of seattle.\\r\\nWe had rented for one night only and arrived much later than expected (sorry for that). But I think Amanda nicely waited for us, and even if we could have discussed only a few minutes (our son was falling asleep). We like this \"couch\" spirit..\\r\\nThanks a lot. To be recommended ! Amanda\\'s place was fantastic. It was very comfortable for two people and felt like we were staying in an apartment rather than a hotel room. It is very private and the amenities are excellent. I would definitely stay there again next time I\\'m in Seattle. Amanda\\'s place was perfect! Super cute and in the perfect location. Several little restaurants that were in walking distance ended up being our favorite in Seattle! Amanda is so sweet and had brownies for us... twice. Can\\'t recommend her highly enough! I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to Seattle many thanks to the wonderful accommodations at Amanda\\'s Ballard home.  I was getting around mostly by public transport and getting to downtown, UW and elsewhere was easy and straightforward.  Wonderful cafe, restaurant and shopping options within Ballard as well.  Amanda is a wonderful host and I highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Seattle. Amanda was a gracious host, leaving brownies for us on arrival and quick to respond to our text messages. The room was very comfortable, spacious and so clean! I took a nice bath to relax. The neighborhood was nice and safe. Would highly recommend this space to friends. It\\'s a gem. Amanda was a wonderful, friendly host and the room is huge, bright, and with everything you could possibly need. Spotless, quiet and great neighborhood.  Thanks Amanda for hosting us.  We loved the quiet neighborhood lined with the blossoming cherry trees!  It is very conveniently located to Ballard and to downtown. Amanda\\'s polace was great. We are super private and that is just what we got. Amanda poked her head out to say hello and I am sure we could have gotten tons of info from her. This neighborhood is great and there are so many great places to eat, Hoinore, Fat Hen, El Camio, Delancy. If you did not want to leave this neighborhood, you would not have to. Everything was super clean and there were brownies when we got there! This place will definetley be on our Seattle list of places to stay! Amanda\\'s place was lovely.  It was the perfect for us.  She is a wonderful host and even though we didn\\'t have a chance to meet her, we felt welcomed by her personal note and brownies!  It has a cozy feel, she provided fresh towels, hair dryer, coffee, cable TV and wifi. \\r\\nI would recommend Amanda\\'s home.  I will definately plan to stay again.  Thanks Amanda!! Amanda was a great host!  The room was exactly as listed, clean and comfortable. We were also given great advice on the type of restaurant we were looking for. Ballard IS beautiful, quiet, and friendly - and staying at Amanda\\'s is a great way to see it. We would definitely stay again. We had an awesome 3 night stay in Ballard last weekend.  Couldn\\'t have asked for a better neighborhood location!  Amanda was a wonderful host, even though we never actually met her during our stay.  She made check in & out easy and left us a sweet welcome treat.  We had all the privacy we needed, but having Amanda right upstairs made us feel well taken care of if we were to need anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room is just as it appears in pictures.  We had all the amenities we cold have needed on a 4 day vacation - mini fridge, coffe & tea supplies, water filter.  There is plenty of closet space and the room is quite spacious with a nice couch/sitting area.  While the room itself was great, I think our favorite part was the bathroom - heated floors were quite a luxury for us!\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the neighborhood - it\\'s absolutely lovely. We could have stayed in Ballard the whole time and never been bored!  On our list of placed we explored (and loved): Sunday morning farmer\\'s market, Ballard Locks, Golden Gardens Park (great beach for a walk, nice park for kids), downtown restaurants and shops.  Plus, right down the street is a cute little collection of fabulous restaurants/bakeries mentioned by Amanda in her description - Honore, Fat Hen, and Delancey.  Be sure to check these out.\\r\\n\\r\\nA final note - We used Car2Go for transportation and were always able to find one relatively close.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would definitely recommend staying with Amanda and plan to stay there again if we ever are able to make another trip to Seattle. Amanda\\'s place is as lovely as everyone says. It is conveniently located and very comfortable, and she provided the usual - very delicious! - brownies. Amanda was a very charming host and was very willing to provide advice and recommendations. I would thoroughly recommend Honore for coffee and pastries and Delancey for fabulous pizzas and very good service (we loved our dinner here so much, we returned the next night too). This place is lovely! Amanda welcomed us with a personal note and brownies and was very accommodating. We had everything we needed to be comfortable. Highly recommended! Amanda\\'s place was just wonderful.  The neighborhood was so lovely and quiet and her apartment was very clean and sweetly decorated.  The bed was so comfy that I slept like an angel.  There were restaurants and local shops very close to browse and have a nice mean.  I would look forward to staying at Amanda\\'s again in the future.  Thanks, Amanda.  Margo A perfect place to stay for a couple of days!\\r\\nYes, Amanda makes brownies, and yes, they are delicious! Go ahead and ask her about where to go and what to eat - she knows everything!\\r\\nBallard is a beautiful neighborhood, quiet and peaceful, with some awesome cafes and boutiques right round the corner; the accommodation is perfectly clean and sunny, with a lovely comfy bed, and even a TV.\\r\\nLoads of parking available outside.  \\r\\nNothing else to wish for! Would stay here again anytime! We had a great time at Amanda\\'s.  The bed is comfortable, the space is well thought out, and we had everything we needed.\\r\\nShe is a thoughtful hostess -- we loved the fresh flowers and brownies!

Amanda was a friendly and accommodating host. The room was excellent and the location was perfect. I would absolutely stay here again. Amanda was so sweet and gave us great recommendations for local places to eat and visit.  We will definitely be staying in her lovely apartment next time we come to the Seattle area.  Ballard is a great and fun neighborhood.  Thank you, Amanda!! Amanda was a great host and even left brownies! The room and bathroom are clean and comfortable, and it\\'s a great location. Definitely a value! We were visiting Seattle for graduation and this was the perfect place to stay! The room is beautiful and well-kept with lots of room, and very comfortable, There was room inside and out to have our whole family hang out, not to mention the free wifi, outdoor space, free parking, and a great neighborhood. The distance to other neighborhoods is also perfect. We could not have gotten a hotel to match this room! very nice, clean and comfortable place. Very private. Parking space. Welcome letter, yummy brownies and fruit basket. excellent value.\\r\\nGreat place to stay. Will be back Amanda\\'s place was awesome and was one of our favorite places to stay during our roadtrip. Her place felt like a home but with the amenities of a hotel. (the bathroom floor was heated!) \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were three of us and we were all very comfortable. It was in a great neighborhood with many popular restaurants nearby. As other reviews had mentioned, she made some delicious brownies for us. I would not hesitate to stay at her place if we visited Seattle again.  Amanda\\'s Place is great. Amanda is a very nice and helpful host. On arrival a plate with self made very delicious brownies was waiting for us. she even drove us to downtown Ballard and to the Skytrain station when we left.\\r\\nThe apartment is as described. There are no eal cooking facilities but there is a fridge and a microwave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bed is very comfortable. The apartment is not that close to downtown but there is a bus station close by (5 minute walking distance) that goes straight to downtown in roughly 35 minutes. downtown Ballard is in walking distance (20 minutes). Thank you Amanda for being such an excellent host! My mother loved your space and she has already told me she wants to come back. She enjoyed your delicious brownies and felt very safe and comfortable there. I will definitely tell my friends from out of town about your wonderful place. xoxo Thank you, Amanda, for a relaxing place to stay during our visit to Seattle.  Your quiet hospitality was evident in all the little things you provide, especially the fruit and brownies! Super pleasant! The space was quiet and serene; the bed was incredibly comfortable; Amanda was really nice to meet and talk to; and the brownies and organic cherries were such a welcoming touch. The neighborhood is lovely, with lots of gardens and birds, and a little strip with a fantastic bakery (Honore), pizzeria (Delancey), and bar (Essex) within a few blocks. This place is a gem. \\r\\n\\r\\n We loved staying with Amanda while we were studying in Ballard for 3 weeks. Her place is comfortable and Amanda was very helpful and friendly. If you\\'re there in summer you\\'ll see her beautiful dahlias too. She\\'s an easy walk from the centre of Ballard and you can get to the centre of Seattle easily with the express bus from only a few blocks away. Highly recommended - thank you Amanda.  We loved staying at Amanda\\'s place. It was clean, quiet and had everything we needed.  The brownies were fantastic, the bouquet of flowers was lovely, the beds were comfy, and the location was perfect!  Amanda was a great host. I give this place five stars!!!!!!!! We had a blast staying here! The location was great. The neighborhood is so cute, and it was very quiet (mostly families with young kids). There were great restaurants only a few blocks from her house, some of the best in Seattle. There was easy access to bus lines, especially if you are looking for Fremont, U District, and downtown. Amanda was also delightful and offered advice about what to see and do along with coupons when we told her what we wanted to do. The brownies when we arrived were an added bonus! This was our first Airbnb experience, and now we are true believers! Amanda was communicative, welcoming, and generous.  The pictures accurately reflected the rooms we inhabited.  They were clean, cute, and well-stocked with little extras for use and guides for navigation.  We felt as though we had a comfortable home base while exploring a new environment.  It was particularly wonderful to have access to her compost bin in addition to the standard trash and recycling receptacles.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bouquets of homegrown flowers were stunning, and her brownies were fudge-i-licious!  She should not be limited by people\\'s expectations for these brownies, as we also learned she makes a killer zucchini bread!  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe recommend Amanda\\'s accommodations without hesitation, and we will be sure to see if she has any availability should we visit Seattle in the future - providing she will have us, of course! Their place is super warm and cozy. The even had brownies laid out for us on the table upon arrival. They have a beautiful Dahlia garden which they use to decorate the house in pots. I loved their cozy home and would definitely stay there again! Amanda was a great host! Seattle was a bit warm when I visited and all I had to do was ask for a fan and there she was with it! :)  The brownies were delicious and her dahlias were just brilliant!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room is a garage conversion but doesn\\'t feel like it at all. It\\'s very sunny in the room,there\\'s a fridge, tv and microwave. The bathroom is across the hall and has a heated floor!\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything was clean and in top shape. I\\'ll certainly try to stay here again on a future visit.\\r\\n Great little place.  The photos don\\'t even show half of how cosy it was.  A nice sofa to sit in the evenings, a REALLY comfy bed (just what you need after 24 hours of travelling) and awesome shower.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda had baked us brownies and left us a note. She\\'s super friendly and helpful, she even let us do a load of washing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place is fully kitted out, shampoo, razors, toothpaste and hair dryer in the bathroom. Tea, coffee and milk in the fridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheres a place to park on the drive or plenty of street parking. It\\'s also a short walk from shops, cafes and gas. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would 100% recommend this place. Amanda space is exactly what she shows! The heated floor in the bathroom & brownies were an extra touch. Her place is great access to everything; interstate, shopping, grocery stores, and restaurants. Amanda\\'s space in Ballard was the perfect place for my Seattle get-away!  The room was comfortable, spacious, and fresh.  Amanda\\'s welcome note and brownies were such a nice touch.  Her front yard was filled with colorful flowers, and her home was just a short walk to shopping and dining.  I\\'d definitely recommend. Lovely stay at Amanda\\'s. We arrived a little late, after dark, but she had lights around the doorway which made it easy to identify her home.  Her place was as described and the beds were comfortable. \\r\\nMy husband loved the fresh baked brownies! Thanks Amanda.\\r\\n We only stayed one night, but we couldn\\'t have been more pleased.  The apartment is very cute and clean, the bed very comfortable, and our 19 year old son slept well on the sofabed.  Amanda was very friendly and directed us to a good Mexican restaurant in the neighbourhood. She had also put beautiful fresh flowers from the garden in a vase and when we arrived there were delicious brownies on a plate waiting for us. We wouldn\\'t have minded staying longer. Amanda\\'s accomodations for guests are perfect.  She offers a private space that\\'s roomy and comfortable and private.  She has lovely dahlias blooming out front and cut dahlias in vases inside.  Brownies tasted wonderful!  She dropped in shortly after we arrived and told us about herself and her daughter and about Seattle.  Her suggestions for sights to see and restaurants were very helpful.  I cannot think of one thing my husband or I needed that she didn\\'t provide.  A wonderful place and a wonderful host.  What more could anyone ask?I   We had such a great stay here! Amanda was very helpful and her place was very comfortable! We hope to stay here  with every trip up to Seattle.  Amanda was a gracious host. The room and bathroom were super clean and comfortable. Lovely amenities. Many  small little things that were a lovely touch for travelers who have been on the road for a while. Check in and out process really easy. Good access to public transport - takes 1/2 hour to get to downtown on D line bus. Lovely quiet suburb. Can\\'t say enough good things about this place. Highest recommendation if you are planning to visit Seattle and want to stay in a nice suburb away from the hustle and bustle. We had a car and could park it in the driveway which was very convenient. Very contented sun baking cats looked at us every morning from inside the house as we exited our room. Would love to stay here if we visit Seattle again. We loved our stay! Fresh brownies in the room upon arrival, relaxed and cute little room, really nice neighborhood. We didn\\'t get a chance to meet Amanda but she was very accommodating nonetheless, calling to make sure we got in okay and leaving clear instructions. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks! Lovely, quiet, clean room. Ample street parking. Delicious brownies. We plan on staying here with our next visit. We had such a great time staying with Amanda! The unit was quite comfortable and spacious, and the location was awesome. We were able to walk to some really yummy and fun places like Delancey\\'s (great drinks and pizza!), and it was just a short drive into downtown Seattle. Amanda provided us with some wonderful suggestions for places to eat and things to do including the Ballard Farmer\\'s Market, which was voted best in the state. It definitely lived up to the title! I think the market was one of our favorite things about Seattle, next to Pike Place Market of course. Amanda even left us some brownies as treats upon our arrival, and there was a well-stocked area with coffee and tea. The fridge and microwave also came in handy. She was available for us when we needed anything and was a wonderful host. We would definitely stay here again! This was my first airbnb stay, and it was a great one!  Very easy to coordinate with Amanda.  Her place was truly beautiful and quiet.  Very comfortable, with a welcoming and cozy feel.  Within walking distance to more places than you would think, given that it is in a residential area.   I stayed at Amanda\\'s place for one night with three other friends and we loved it! The whole space was very clean with lots of privacy. The beds were comfy, even the pull-out! I especially loved that there were organic teas, coffee and SOY MILK(being vegan and all)! It really warms my heart when a host goes the extra mile to accommodate all needs. I would love to stay with Amanda again for my next visit. It was just as all the others have said...\"All the comforts of home\"!  The bed was very comfortable, nice desk/table for computer work, etc.. (wifi worked perfectly), comfortable couch for watching TV (HD picture a bonus of a rain-soaked day) or for eating (on TV tables no less). Made good use of the microwave and refrigerator, and Amanda has provided a more than adequate supply of dishes, glasses, and silverware, along with a good selection of teas, and even some soy milk in the frig.  There are lots of lights in the room, so you can read/work wherever you\\'d want, and you have control of the temperature with a nice space heater.  The bathroom is only 2 steps outside your room, and it was well-stocked and spotless. The shower had plenty of hot water (and water power), and Amanda provides soap, shampoo, conditioner, towels (I haven\\'t had a bad experience at any previous Airbnb stay, but Amanda definitely goes above and beyond expectations to make your stay comfortable.)\\r\\nParking was convenient (driveway, or right in front on the street), and it was an easy 4-block walk to catch a bus straight to downtown (much easier than trying to park in downtown Seattle).\\r\\nThere is no traffic noise, and the house was also very quiet.\\r\\nI\\'d definitely look forward to another stay in \"Friendly Ballard\"...Thanks, Amanda ! AMAZING!!!  Our stay was perfect.  It was easy to check in, comfortable bed (with incredible pillows!), everything we could possibly need, yummy brownies waiting for us, quiet neighborhood near public transportation and amazing food.  The room was clean and great!  \\r\\nAmanda was a great host and extremely friendly. \\r\\np.s. the picture shows a small tv but they upgraded to a larger flat screen that can be viewed from the couch or the bed- it was a nice touch! Amanda\\'s house was quiet and comfortable. I love the radiant heat in the bathroom. It is like staying with friends. Recommended. Very large and comfortable space in nice neighborhood.  Well equiped with frig, coffee maker, hot water, plates/cutlery, tea and coffee.  Amanda was very communicative when we were making arrangement. Beautiful flower garden too.   We had a wonderful stay in Ballard at Amanda\\'s! Bill and I enjoy exploring neighborhoods in Seattle.  Ballard has the fascinating Ballard Locks, fine restaurants, neighborhood bakeries and eateries, beautiful dahlias, museums nearby, and an accessible city bus system. Everything in easy reach!  We will definitely return.\\r\\nAmanda and her apartment were each as comfortable as we had hoped.  We met Amanda only once, and \"clicked\" and the place seemed to be ours--  becoming our home for four days.  Loved the warm bathroom floors--what an added luxury! We would recommend this location with the highest marks! Amy Great place, good location, priced right, pleasant host.  I can recommend this place without reservation.  Heated floor in bathroom a nice amenity.\\r\\n On all three: Beautiful, Quiet, Friendly - Amanda gets an \"A\"!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our week-long stay. The place was comfy and clean with everything we needed. The welcome brownies were a nice surprise. We will stay again should the opportunity arise. Thank you Amanda. The best thing about this place was that I was greeted with homemade brownies. This place was clean, cozy, quiet, and had a comfortable bed and a great internet connection. I\\'ll definitely be staying here again.  We LOVED staying with Amanda in Ballard during our recent visit to Seattle! Her home was unbelievably comfortable and clean. We were welcomed with homemade vegan brownies and given excellent recommendations for vegetarian eats in the area. My partner and I make a trip to Seattle every year, and I look forward to staying here again next time! Amanda\\'s place was comfortable and conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood. Amanda was easy to communicate with and I would definitely stay here again! Great location, beautiful little spot. Hope to come back again! Great location for our stay in Seattle!  Comfortable bed...all the amenities.  Definitely would recommend!!!  We had the opportunity to meet Amanda on the last night of our stay- super friendly and accommodating.  Thanks Amanda!   Amanda\\'s converted garage apartment was clean and fresh. Best part was, although the bathroom was in another part of the garage (a few steps away) the floor was heated! I\\'d recommend it! Amanda\\'s was just what we needed when visiting Seattle for the birth of my grandson. My daughter and son in law live in the same area and was very easy coming and going. The room was large, clean and comfortable and it was nice to be able to buy some groceries and eat some simple meals there. If you get a chance go to the Fat Hen for breakfast...Delicious and a 5 minute walk! Honore is right across the street from the Fat Hen and has fabulous croissants. Both make an excellent latte. We will return! Quiet, comfortable, and convenient. Our go to place in Seattle. Amanda\\'s place was clean and comfortable.  On a cold night, the room was warm, and we appreciated the electric kettle and tea. The location was perfect for our overnight stay in Ballard.  Amanda\\'s communication with me was very good. Although we never met her in person, we felt welcome in her downstairs room.    My parents stayed with Amanda during the Chirstmas holiday. Her home apartment is very close to our home so it was convenient for their stay. Her place is large clean and very cozy. They were very happy with the bed and the spacious room.  Also the bathroom is well appointed.  Amanda was a a terrific host. We will definitely return for our out of town guests!\\r\\n Adorable.  Cozy.  Friendly.  Amanda was such a nice host and so giving in so many ways.   She found out we\\'re vegan and left vegan cookies, and also soy milk in the fridge.  I love little details like that because it makes a difference in helping us to feel welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoved the organics throughout, including the shampoo and conditioner!  \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks, Amanda.  You are fab.  We WILL be back.  :) I\\'ve stayed here 3 times and have loved it. Any issues were dealt with immediately, the place is sparkling clean, and there\\'s a really good, \"homey\" vibe. I\\'ll definitely stay again and would highly recommend it! Amanda was a wonderful host--courteous, welcoming, helpful, and a great storyteller! Her home was even more cozy and lovely than the pictures (if that\\'s possible!). You\\'ll find her neighborhood perfect for walks, near quaint restaurants, and a perfect area to explore. I will definitely get in touch with Amanda the next time I\\'m in Seattle.  Amanda\\'s place was just lovely and cozy! The neighborhood was very clean and quiet. My friend and I loved it! Her place was well stocked and having a hair blow dryer in her bathroom was definitely a great perk! That\\'s one less item for us girls to carry in our luggage. haha. Her place is very close to downtown and everything that Seattle is known for. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda is a great host! She made sure we were comfortable and was very accommodating. I would definitely stay here again when I come back!  We stayed at Amanda\\'s for a week and loved it. It is a bright and cheery room with all the little amenities to make it feel like home. Bed was comfortable and neighborhood quiet so we slept well. Amanda is so accommodating and offered to let us use the washer and dryer which was great since we were there a week. The only negative was that her cats didn\\'t come down to visit us It was pleasure staying at Amanda\\'s.  There were 3 of us who just needed a place to stay for the night.  It was very accommodating. Amanda and her place were great!  Her house is on a really nice and quiet street in a fantastic area of Seattle (lots of great restaurants, coffee/tea shops, movie theater, etc close by).  Amanda was super nice and helpful explaining how we could catch the bus (very convenient and easy) to downtown Seattle.  We would definitely stay there again.       Amanda was such a welcoming, responsive host!  She thinks through all the details to make your stay pleasant.  Her place is such a great deal. We had such a wonderful time staying at Amanda\\'s. Sadly we never met because of our crazy schedule, but I\\'m sure we would have been fast friends. Her place is located in a quiet neighborhood, close to several bus lines and some great restaurants. The Fat Hen, Delanceys, and Essex were amazing... and it only takes 15 min to get to downtown Seattle. The room is very cozy with everything you need, fridge, tea kettle, a very comfy and warm bed, and homemade brownies:), thanks Amanda! The bathroom is amazing with radiant floor heating and plenty of hot water. Amanda answered all of my crazy questions and was very helpful! I hope we can stay with her again the next time we visit.  We had a great time at Amanda\\'s place in Ballard. We felt immensely welcome, we had a couple nice chats with Amanda and we were greeted with delicious brownies upon arrival. The room was comfortable, with lots of different surfaces to sit, lounge, and lay about on. It was also easy to feel ourselves at home there because there was a ton of storage to unpack into since the room\\'s a dedicated guest room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heated floor in the bathroom is sooo good. Note that the bathroom is not in the room, but is just outside the door leading into the basement. It was really nice to have a private entrance and driveway. We were even lucky enough to get a short visit from her friendly cat!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is good, there\\'s grocery stores and restaurants about a ten minute walk away. It is a bit of a hike from the core of downtown Ballard, but it\\'s certainly walkable, and there\\'s an easy bus for the less adventurous. Ballard is a hip Seattle neighborhood with many interesting businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again! Our 5 night stay worked well for us as it was close to the family we were visiting. I loved taking a neighborhood walk each morning in this great and quiet location. I was happy to see many items provided, such as a plastic one-cup coffee filter & paper filters, a filtered water pitcher and use of the washer/dryer. Lighting in the room is excellent, both natural light and artificial lighting. We were surprised to find the private bathroom separate from the apartment, across a small walkway in the basement, though it posed no real problem for us. It did mean we had to take dishes to be washed either to the bath or basement laundry area to be cleaned. The apartment is definitely good value for the cost. This is a very cozy place in a great neighborhood.  We could walk to the Fat Hen for one of the best breakfasts I\\'ve ever had.\\r\\nShe left a basket of great toys for my kids.  The place was spotless, warm and she was very communicative.  I highly recommend staying here and hope to again next time we\\'re in Seattle. First time staying in Ballard area. Stayed one night en route back to Vancouver.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda\\'s place is a lovely space. No kitchen, but has microwave, fridge, kettle, and fixings for coffee & tea, even milk & soy milk! Great living space & comfortable bed. Washroom is in a different area of the basement.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeighbourhood seems nice, enjoyed breakfast at a recommended place (The Fat Hen). We would love to stay longer next time & explore the neighbourhood. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn\\'t get a chance to meet Amanda, but she seems very sweet. There\\'s some construction work in the basement, she was considerate in getting the workers to come after we left. Thanks for the brownies & fruit, hope to meet you next time! :) Highly recommend & would love to stay there again. Beautiful place! Nice quiet location with free street parking and lots of great restaurants nearby. Had everything we needed and more! Loved everything about it! All the the previous reviews are spot on! Amanda was really nice and personable! The apt was perfect-cozy, relaxing, clean! I would love to stay here again my next time in Seattle! Thanks Amanda!  Amanda\\'s place was so cozy and inviting. I wished that my stay would have been longer but the one night I was there was restful and comfortable. I appreciated Amanda\\'s warm welcome and the thought she put into making the space comfortable. Thanks for opening up your home to travelers.  Amanda is a really brilliant host - we loved her! We had nice little conversations with her about we wanted to do in Seattle and she gave us great tips and helped plan our days. We even had freshly baked brownies when we arrived after a hard day of rainy driving! We felt completely comfortable in the quite large room, which is very private. The bed is really comfortable too! There are some great places to eat and drink nearby - check out the guidebook. We\\'d love to stay again if we come back to Seattle. Met with brownies and fresh fruit, the most comfortable bed and linens.  A close walk to so many things.  I would stay here again anytime.  Thank you Amanda. This was an *ideal* place from which to base our Seattle adventures! It was spacious, comfortable, and attractive, and we loved the neighborhood - close proximity to lots of shops, restaurants, etc. but still quiet and residential. Amanda was easy to work with and a very welcoming person. I\\'d come back anytime. Great stay! Amanda was really great about communicating with us before we arrived, and while we were there. She also had excellent brownies for us when we got in. Also gave some suggestions for what to do during our stay, which ended up being great (the Ballard Farmer\\'s market) Would definitely stay here again! We loved this place, it was very new, clean, well decorated and comfy. We had everything we needed from organic fruits to homemade brownies, filtered water and real coffee. Definitely our kind of place. No doubt, we will come back. Thanks Amanda. To reiterate what many others have said, the place was exactly as advertised, and Amanda was great about checking in with us before our arrival and during our stay.  The location is a few blocks away from the bus stop, and the ride to downtown Seattle takes about 20-30 minutes.  I would highly recommend Amanda\\'s place to anyone visiting Seattle! Amanda is SO lovely and interesting; I had a great stay and would highly recommend her home to anybody traveling to Seattle. The room is exactly as pictured-- clean and comfortable-- and provided everything you could need during your stay: minifridge, space heater, guidebooks, coffee, tea, fresh fruit, brownies, and more. The location is also excellent; a short bus ride or walk away from Fremont and Ballard. Amanda even offered us a ride one day it was raining. The surrounding neighborhood is neat too. The best part is that she\\'s just so easy-going and laid back; I never felt rushed or stressed being there. Next time I\\'m in Seattle, I know where I\\'m staying. Amanda was very friendly and the room very clean and well maintained. Amanda\\'s Ballard space is just as described, and a great location for visiting Seattle.  We stayed two nights and loved exploring the neighborhood with it\\'s charming bungalows and restaurants and shops.\\r\\nWe used the bed and the pull out sofa and both were comfortable and the bathroom was very nice.  \\r\\nAmanda was very friendly and communicative and we even had a chance to chat a bit our second evening, which was lovely.  She left homemade brownies for us upon our arrival, a very welcome!\\r\\nI would very much recommend Amanda\\'s Ballard space to anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan\\r\\nMinneapolis, MN What a perfect place!  The room is bigger than it looks in the pictures; Essentially, it a small (well-equipped, well-appointed) apartment.  The bed is extremely comfy - I would have stayed there all day but Seattle is right outside! \\r\\n \\r\\nAmanda is fab!  I was lucky enough to spend some time with her as I had many questions about teaching in the area, which is what she does and I am hoping to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also got to spend some time with Manzo and Tuti :))) My husband and I stayed at Amanda\\'s cozy studio for three nights in April, 2014.  Amanda was a wonderful host and the space was perfect for us.  Everything we needed was provided for in the studio, and Amanda was kind enough to leave us some home-baked brownies!  We appreciated the thoughtfulness with which the space is laid out, providing for a place to watch tv, a desk/table, and a cozy bed with fluffy pillows.  There\\'s also plenty of storage to stow what you\\'re not using.  The bathroom has luxe heated floors, too, and it\\'s nice being able to do laundry.   Charming, spacious, well-equipped and welcoming. Easy access and parking, and amenities like electric kettle, microwave, heated bathroom floor make the place homey and relaxing. Amanda is very easy going and responsive. So lovely, would definitely recommend.  Great host & apartment! Spacious, clean, safe & lovely neighborhood, close to public transit. A+! This place was beautiful! The bed was so comfy and it was in an awesome neighborhood. I suggest the Barking Dog Alehouse nearby. The room had everything and it was so welcoming and cozy. The hostess welcomed us with fantastic brownies and fruit. Also, the room had an amazing tea assortment. :) thank you again! This was a wonderful place to stay on our way to Vancouver and home. We loved the room and the neighborhood. Amanda was really great and left fruit and brownies for us in the room. She also made some really great recommendations for restaurants in the area. Overall, we had a great experience and hope to stay there again the next time we\\'re in Seattle. A warm welcome and comfortable stay. The steady wifi and table/desk set up was handy for being online. Will be back for sure!\\n We had a lovely time at Amanda\\'s. She was very communicative before and during our stay so we felt right at home. We were lucky with weather and enjoyed relaxing in the backyard.  You can\\'t beat the restaurants on 70th either. Amanda was very nice and the room is very comfortable. Nice quiet neighborhood but close to a lot of great locations. I would stay here again! Also her brownies are delicious! Thanks! The listing was as described. It is a very nicely decorated and comfortable studio with a nice sitting area and mini-kitchen in a very nice neighborhood. Kitchen included micro-wave, refrigerator, and supplies for making coffee or tea. Also the hosts were kind enough to leave milk in the refrigerator, fresh fruit, and a couple of home made brownies. The bed was very comfortable and the towels and bathroom were very nice and the host provided shampoo and cream rinse. Amanda is very thoughtful and friendly. She made us brownies and there was fruit, milk and all kinds of tea inside the room. It was such a beautiful house and area to stay. We stayed there for 2 nights and we enjoyed it a lot! The bus station is close to our house and also the restaurant nearby is very delicious! We will definitely stay in Amanda\\'s house again when we visit Seattle. Amanda was very friendly, generous, and accommodating. We arrived after camping and not having laundry service. She arranged her schedule so that we could use the laundry as soon as we arrived. The place was clean and cozy in the perfect neighborhood of Ballard. In addition to the food she provided (fruits, milk, oatmeal), we LOVED the The Fat Hen (breakfast/lunch) and Delancey (dinner), both around the corner. Delancey has some of the best pizza we have ever had! Ballard has a wonderful downtown and there is a bike path that goes right to downtown Seattle from the Ballard Locks. We look forward to our next stay, and would definitely recommend Amanda\\'s place :)     Even nicer the second time. Quiet neighborhood. Enjoyed the welcome note with brownies. The heater was on which made the place cozy on a very rainy day when I arrived. Great place to stay. Loved the neighborhood and Amanda was very friendly.  I would definitely stay here again! Great experience!  This was our first airbnb stay and we really enjoyed the space and our host.   Amanda\\'s cute apartment was perfect for our one night stay.  She supplied us with delicious brownies, a comfortable bed, and coffee for the next morning.  The neighborhood is a quiet and convenient area, with plenty of restaurants nearby, but is also a quick drive to historic Ballard Avenue if other options are needed.  Overall, the apartment was cozy and affordable, and we would stay there again! This was a great apartment to stay at. It was comfortable and very private. It has a large bathroom and bedroom. The neighborhood is quiet, but it does offer several very good restaurants within walking distance. We enjoyed our stay! The residence was a perfect fit for our needs, and the price was right. The neighborhood is quiet and near a few fine eateries and coffee shops. It is quite a walk or a bus ride to the heart of the Ballard District, but this is not a drawback. The moderate distance is very manageable and lends to the peaceful setting of Amanda\\'s home. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accommodations were clean, well-stocked, very pleasant and just the right fit for two travelers. Amanda was a gracious and generous hostess. She didn\\'t interfere with our stay, but she was available and helpful anytime we needed assistance. We found her to be genuinely friendly and considerate. We would definitely consider staying at her place again. Comfortable, private and spotless accommodation, ideally located in a leafy residential area well served with some superb local restaurants.  We spent 3 days in her apartment with our two daughters and Amanda couldn\\'t have been more helpful and welcoming and was full of advice regarding places to go etc. This was precisely the kind of experience which makes  us choose AirBnB for our holiday accommodation. We loved staying at Amanda\\'s airbnb! Check in was simple, time was flexible, very nice. The space is exactly what it looks like in the photos-- very comfortable, clean, updated. Private entrance. It is in a residential neighborhood that seems  very friendly and inviting. We did not have our own car while we were in town and did just fine between walking and taking the bus. We were in town seeing friends who did have a car so that was helpful at times. If I was here alone, I probably would have rented a car. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! This was our first stay at an airbnb and Amanda has set the bar very high!  Super clean and in a quiet residential location, I strongly recommend Amanda\\'s place. Amanda is incredibly nice and helpful, too. Would definitely stay here again.  We were greater by Amanda when we pulled up.  She gave us an introduction to her rental unit.  She also left a plate of brownies for us.  After being on the road for 4 days it was nice to have a place where we could unpack and relax.  The unit is well thought out, quite roomy,  and had everything we needed, including a boiling pot for water and some organic coffee which was delicious.  There was lots of storage and the bathroom even had a heated floor.  Included was a TV with the  Direct TV system.  We felt right at home and would definitely stay again.   This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was excellent -- very clean, tidy, comfortable, quiet, and friendly.  I would highly recommend this location, especially if you want to be in Ballard! Amanda was a great host. There were home baked brownies when we arrived and the place was spotless.  We enjoyed eating breakfast on her back deck.  The neighborhood is quiet and friendly.  Parking was always easy.  There were three of us and it was a bit tight, but it worked.  The queen bed was very comfortable. There\\'s a small refridgerater and a microwave.  Any dishes you use need to be washed in the bathroom sink, so eating anything other than breakfast or finger food isn\\'t the best.  But Seattle has so many great restaurants, who wants to eat in, anyway?  I would definitely recommend! Amanda was so welcoming and she seems to have gone out of her way to make sure her guests are comfortable- fruit, coffee, brownies(!), a water filtration pitcher, fresh-cut flowers, etc.. The room was not an \"after thought\"- loved the quality mattress and renovated bathroom. This was a great deal on a quiet street and we would definitely return.  Thanks, Amanda! This is an excellent place to stay.The  spacious apartment is nicely decorated with  loads of storage space, renovated bathroom, desk,and coffee/tea set- up and microwave.  The  fridge was equipped with milk, butter, margarine, and jam in it!!! As others have said...homemade brownies...fresh fruit and flowers help you feel that you are welcome. Very private,quiet and nice neighborhood near busses and restaurants. A definite recommendation.  Can\\'t say enough great things about this adorable room walking distance to some great spots in Ballard like the Fat Hen and Delancey.  Room and bathroom were moden and spacious and had everything we needed for a great stay, our host even left delcious brownies as a welcoming treat :) Transportation to and from downtown on the Rapid Transit was easy and affordable.   Amanda\\'s space was very welcoming, convenient and clean. She and her daughter let us have our space while making sure everything in the apartment was ready for us. I would definitely recommend staying here. If you rent a car, there is plenty of parking and if you care to walk, the location is optimal.  Very cozy & private stay here. Thank you so much for the brownies:)!!! Amanda was there to greet my cousin as she arrived, and made her feel right at home. There was fruit and brownies that Amanda had made, and a personal note from her.  I didn\\'t arrive until much later with my son, but Amanda had come downstairs the next day, and we finally met. \\r\\nShe has a nice set-up in the room we were in, and both her front and backyards had beautiful flowers.\\r\\n She graciously allowed my son to use a bike and helmet for some \\'exploring\\', and we were also able to use the backyard for \\'private time\\'. \\r\\nThe beds were quite comfortable, plus we had access to more linens, bed sheets, and a nice washer/dryer were also available. \\r\\nThe bathroom was very roomy, with nice lighting.\\r\\nAll in all, it was a very comfy stay, Amanda is a super host, and we were very happy with our accommodations.   Amanda was super nice! She greatest my wife and I with brownies upon arrival. The place was just as advertised. The apartment was easy to find, clean as a whistle, and parking was not a problem at all.   My boyfriend and I traveled to Portland and Seattle over labor day weekend and we sure did pick the best places to stay! We were greeted with brownies in the fridge, a variety of teas, and a nice welcome note. We did not have a lot of time in Seattle but we made the most of it, and the location of Amanda\\'s place was great. We would definitely stay there again! Fantastic! Amanda was really friendly and easy to coordinate and communicate with.  Thanks for the wonderful stay!  The place looks exactly like the picture. This was our first airbnb experience and our first stop on a road trip. Amanda\\'s place was lovely and very private. Amanda had left some delicious brownies and we felt very welcome. We would happily stay here again. Thanks! Comfortable stay for one night. Amanda devoted a lot of thought to making our stay comfortable which was evident from check in to check out.  Easy stay, nice quiet neighborhood but very close to Ballard restaurant area which we loved! We parked right in the driveway which was appreciated. Easy to communicate with host, great stay!  We absolutely loved our stay in Seattle. Totally fell in love with the city and Amanda\\'s unit could not have been more perfect. Clean, comfy, and close enough to shops and restaurants ... But also tucked away in a nice residential area that made us feel like we were getting a taste of real Seattle. Ballard and Phinney Ridge are super charming. \\n\\nThe unit itself is well stocked with toiletries and towels, coffee, a mini-fridge, books and magazines ... Everything you need. And the brownies that were waiting on us were delicious! Would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it highly. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda was awesome. My girlfriend & I arrived very late our first night due to flight delays, but sure enough, brownies and a warmly lit front door/driveway beckoned us into our own quarters in her Amanda\\'s home. She included a welcome letter as well. We had everything we needed throughout our 4-night stay, and the location is prime for getting easily to/from many of Seattle\\'s famous tourist attractions and its thriving Downtown area. Ballard was extremely charming and turned out to be our favorite neighborhood of those we experienced during our stay. Thank you so much, Amanda!  We booked the wrong date but Amanda was really kind about it and offered us to stay the following weekend if she had not already booked guests.  Amanda was awesome. My girlfriend & I arrived very late our first night due to flight delays, but sure enough, brownies and a warmly lit front door/driveway beckoned us into our own quarters in her Amanda\\'s home.

Ballard was extremely charming and turned out to be our favorite neighborhood of those we experienced during our stay. Thank you so much, Amanda! I couldn\\'t have been more happy with my stay. The unit was quiet, clean and very welcoming. The brownies were the cherry on top. Although my schedule kept me from meeting Amanda, she was so helpful and checked in on me via email to make sure my trip was going well. I would recommend her and this spot to anyone.  Dahlias and brownies!  Quaint, comfortable & clean space for us, and we were greeted with freshly cut dahlias and brownies to snack on. We loved our stay at Amanda\\'s unit and fell in love with Ballard. The unit itself was perfect. It was clean and very comfy. We couldn\\'t have asked for anything more. Green Lake area was georgeous and only a quick jog from the unit. We look forward to our return to Seattle and would definitely stay with Amanda again.  Absolutely perfect. Price was great. Spot was super cute with good amount of amenities. Amanda was a very accommodating host but gave us privacy as well. Great neighborhood that\\'s walkable and short ride into downtown. Clean, comfy, we\\'re making this our go to Seattle spot.  Amanda was so accommodating ! Let us come early and shower after camping so I could meet my family. She made awesome brownies and the place was in a great location. Super cute!  Amanda was very responsive, flexible, and made herself available (although we were out and about, she seemed interested in saying hello which was very nice). We had complete independence and privacy, and the neighborhood was lovely, quiet. We arrived to a plate of the most delicious brownies I\\'ve had in my life, and a warm welcome note. The room would have comfortably slept 4, was very clean, and was cozy as well. Great vibes :) Great spot :) Amanda greeted us as we arrived, and my wife and I immediately felt at home. The spacious basement apartment had easy access to the street and a beautiful gardened backyard, and freshly baked brownies were ready for us when we unlocked our door. Everything was very tidy.  Amanda was well prepared for our overnight stay. She greeted my wife and I with homemade brownies and a smile. The accommodations were even better than described. The free WiFi was very handy. Her advice as a local resident spared us a good hour\\'s worth of local traffic and we enjoyed a delicious breakfast  at a placed she recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur overall experience was a great one. The privacy, comfortable bed, and convenient location were a great value. Thanks Amanda! Clean, comfortable, and the delicious brownies are such a nice welcome. Wish I needed to stay longer. The room was very nice - quiet and clean and comfortable. Amanda welcomed us with brownies and fresh flowers, which was really a nice touch. It was a perfect place to stay for a quick trip to Seattle. We spent two nights and were very happy with our stay. The location was perfect for driving into the city. Everything seemed to be under 20 mins away.\\n\\nThe studio itself was very clean and comfortable. The check in process was painless. Amanda is very friendly and even had fruits and a brownie waiting for us when we arrived.\\n\\nWould completely recommend to anyone. We felt right at home in Amanda\\'s downstairs mini apartment. It was cozy, pleasant and clean. We also fell in love with Ballard and all it\\'s little houses and wonderful places to eat. Will be looking forward to our next visit! The room was fantastic and Amanda was very responsive and friendly. Although we weren\\'t able to meet her until the last day of our trip (we were out and about!), she welcomed us with a lovely note and plate of delicious brownies upon our check-in. The room itself was very cozy and had all we needed for our 4-day trip. The Ballard neighborhood was charming and allowed us to have an authentic Seattle experience.  Great, cozy, central place to stay in the Ballard area! We were welcomed to the suite with a welcome letter and delicious brownies. The room felt like home and had all the required amenities. Amanda helped direct us to the areas to check out as well as transit options. There were lots of great restaurants, bars and easy access to downtown Seattle from here. Would definitely recommend Amanda\\'s place to anyone wanting to explore Ballard and surrounding areas!  Great location in Ballard. Amanda\\' s room was very cosy and clean. Amanda was very nice. We highly recommend this place.  Amanda communicates great, left brownies for us, very responsive and friendly.  Love the private entrance and quiet neighborhood: great for walking and garden viewing. Warm, cozy, spacious! It was a lovely place to stay. Very warm and welcoming. Amanda was an awesome host and we felt very comfortable.  We had a pleasant stay at Amanda\\'s unit. The electric heater in the room kept us cozy throughout the nights. The size of the place was big enough for us, and street parking was abundant. Amanda herself was welcoming and helpful when we asked for suggestions to getting around the city. We would definitely stay here again!  Very comfortable space- clean and bright, spacious, excellent location, accommodating and flexible host, quiet and restful. Excellent value, too. What more can we wish for? This apartment, in a word, ideal.  Very easy to find, the location is great.  Nice private room, clean and private bathroom.  Everything fully operable, really no issues at all.  Bed had clean sheets, the mattress was very comfortable.  Pillow choices were good.  Brownies on arrival were great after a long trip.  The fruit basket was helpful for a quick morning snack as well.  We traveled to and from the apartment both by bus and using Uber.  Bus stops are nearby, and Uber easily found the apartment.  If I were to return to Seattle, this would be my first choice. Great. Easy stay, comfortable place, all the amenities we wanted. I had a late arrival but found the house and keys without any problems. The tray of cookies was a nice welcome.\\r\\n One of the coziest places I\\'ve stayed at in Seattle!  Clean, comfy bed, and treats that greeted us with a cute note.  Very close to several delicious restaurants in the Ballard neighborhood.  Amanda was very easy to communicate with.  I will definitely try to stay here on my next trip to Seattle!  Thanks Amanda! We had a wonderful stay at Amanda\\'s--she was pleasant, responsive, and wholly helpful and available for both general and specific space-related questions. The room is as advertised, with two closets and copious storage space, and the chocolate, fruit, milk, coffee and tea available  began our mornings wonderfully! The bathroom was well ventilated (the heated floor perfect for our December stay!), and included plentiful toiletries. We look forward to staying again! It was a really nice place with convenient transportation. Made me feel like home! Amanda was incredibly welcoming and gave us some great tips as far as where to go for hiking, nightlife, etc. The room was beyond comfortable, and was located in close proximity to some nice restaurants and cafes. Would certainly stay here again in the future.  Amanda was an excellent host! We had a late flight in and got to Ballard close to 10pm. The room was warmed up and there were brownies waiting for us. It was such a sweet touch. She even left out a basket of toys for my 18 month old. The neighborhood is beautiful and the public transportation is really easy. My wife, son, and I stayed for 5 days and had no problem getting all over Ballard and into downtown Seattle just by bus. The room was the perfect size for us and having access to a washer and drier made a big difference, especially when we had been out in the rain. This was our first time using Arirbnb and we\\'ll definitely be doing it again. Amanda\\'s place is on the top of our list for places to stay next time we come to Seattle and I\\'d highly recommend it to anybody else.  The place was clean, bright, and cozy, and the host was friendly and wonderful. I would definitely stay here again. Our stay with Amanda couldn’t have been any better.  The unit was clean, cozy, and very well-appointed—they’ve thought of everything.  There was food to greet us when we arrived, and we were tickled to find that everything we needed, and more, was there.  Amanda had everything a hotel would—soap, shampoo, hairdryer, etc., but also a number of other toiletries you might need, from toothpaste to hair gel.  In addition to the fridge and microwave, a Brita pitcher was waiting with water, and a selection of teas was available.  The place was warm, even in the middle of winter, and it sits in the middle of a fantastic Seattle neighborhood.  Amanda was friendly, easy-going, and available with plenty of suggestions for exploring the area.  We hope to be able to visit again! great host cool location Amanda\\'s communication prior to our arrival was fantastic.  When we arrived we found a charming, perfectly clean room with a plate of brownies for us!  The room had every amenity we could want and the location was quiet and there was parking!  Staying there was a great experience and I would stay there again.   Amazing place to stay! Amanda was the best host. She was very helpful with any questions we had. I loved the brownies she had made for us and even had milk in the fridge to go with it. The space was spacious and it was everything you needed for a weekend getaway. I would definitely be staying here if I make another trip out to Seattle.  I saw reviews that said \"stop looking, book now.\" That\\'s solid advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda is a dream to communicate with -- helpful, and gives great clear instructions. Because of our arrival and departure times we weren\\'t able to meet, but it definitely felt like we had our autonomy while also being warmly welcomed. Pretty incredible. Superhost indeed!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was spotlessly clean and so cozy and nice. Parking was so easy. The neighborhood has nice places in walking distance but is quiet and peaceful at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, I highly suggest that you book this place! Our stay at Amanda\\'s was great! Everything was clean and cozy. The space was large and comfortable enough for our family of 4 adults and 1 baby. Amanda was gracious to let us make a last minute reservation.  Our stay was perfect! The apartment was very beautiful and we had everything we need. Amanda was a wonderful host and we are definitely coming back!  Amanda was a wonderful host and we absolutely adored our room. The neighborhood is very nice and it\\'s easy to get to food and entertainment on foot. We will definitely come back here! My girlfriend fell in love with the bathroom. Radiant Heat is a game changer! This was our first airbnb experience and we loved it. Amanda was warm, welcoming, and helpful. The delicious brownies and fruit were much appreciated. The room was clean, comfortable, and tranquil. \\r\\nWe loved exploring the neighborhood restaurants. The new reataurant, Brunswick and Hunt, was a great find.\\r\\nWe would stay here again and highly recommend it.  Amanda\\'s place was really great! She was able to book us for a fairly last minute stay, and everything was clean. She left us with anything we could have possibly needed for our stay, including a plate of brownies. Amanda\\'s place was great! Roomy, comfortable, clean, and in a fun part of Seattle. And Amanda was so friendly and helpful. It was definitely one of my favorite Airbnb stays. I would stay here again in a heartbeat the next time I\\'m in Seattle.  Amanda\\'s space is very cozy in a quiet neighborhood not too far from downtown. I loved that there was coffee and tea that could easily be prepared, and organic milk provided in the mini fridge. Amanda was very accommodating of our last minute plans and got back to me quickly. The room is a converted garage under the main house, so we were a little hesitant of our noise level. It wasn\\'t anything that disrupted our stay though. I would recommend it! This host was very nice and quick to respond, locations was very convenient for everything and you don\\'t have to worry about parking! The room was very clean and accommodating.  This is our third visit to Amanda\\'s place in Ballard. It feels almost as\\r\\ncomfortable as home being convenient and quiet. It\\'s better than\\r\\nadvertised. Upon arriving at Amanda\\'s space, we were greeted with pistachios and organic strawberries.  Both snacks were appreciated following a long drive to Seattle.\\n\\nThe hospitality didn\\'t end there!  The space was warm and welcoming (so was the bathroom floor - which was heated!!!!).  The pictures accurately reflect the coziness of the room.\\n\\nAlthough we didn\\'t meet Amanda directly, she made sure that we knew she was available if needed.\\n\\nI would highly recommend a stay with Amanda.  Thank you!!! This place was perfect and felt very private. The neighborhood is beautiful and great for taking a stroll. Little homemade snacks were a welcome touch after being on the road. Thanks for making us feel so welcome! A wonderful, clean, safe, friendly spot. Amanda was very welcoming. The brownies in the refrigerator were a nice touch. Great neighborhood with a few good restaurants within walking distance. The Fat Hen about 4 blocks away is a great breakfast spot. We would definitely stay here again.   Amanda\\'s place in Ballard was exactly as described—lovely, quiet, and peaceful. There were brownies and fresh fruit waiting for me when I arrived, and I especially enjoyed being able to make a cup of tea with the electric kettle.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is perfect for a run to the Ballard Locks and a walk to Market Street. As a former Seattleite, I have to say that this location felt like being back at home! Staying here will give you a good sense of what it\\'s like to live in an iconic Seattle neighborhood. There are beautiful gardens (including Amanda\\'s), and it\\'s walking/running distance to the Ballard Locks and Market Street. I highly recommend staying at Amanda\\'s home!  Everything was perfect and exactly as described.  Amanda welcomed me the day of my arrival and made sure I was all set.  The neighborhood is great - lot\\'s of cafes, restaurants shops - yet quiet and peaceful, and perfect for walks.   Very nice and quiet place.  Clean and cozy :) private suite and had a set of keys fr us.  definitely recommend.   Perfect stay in Ballard. Space was comfy and convenient. Amanda was a great host. Definitely recommend. Amanda was very friendly and a joy to talk to. Weather great! Bed nice and cozy and all the essentials needed for our overnight stay. Wonderful apartment to stay in in Ballard. Quite more than comfortable, as Amanda has taken great care to provide even more amenities than a hotel! She had tea, water, and fresh fruit waiting for us, as well as brownies and wifi. The room and the bathroom are neat and very clean. There were towels and soap there too. The bed and the sofa were very comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet at night and filled with people walking their dogs and kids going to school in the day. Just a 10-15 minute walk from some amazing restaurants such as Delancy and Essex and The Fat Hen. I would 100% recommend staying here. What a gem! Amanda was very responsive to all of our inquiries and responded very quickly to our initial request to book. She\\'s a great host.  Although we didn\\'t get the opportunity to meet Amanda, she was incredibly inviting!  She left a personal note and some brownies greeting us at the door. Getting into the space was no problem at all and there was plenty of parking (which is sometimes difficult to find in Seattle). She also made some restaurant recommendations for us since we\\'d be getting into town for a late dinner. The space is super cute and completely private from the upstairs where she lives. It had everything we needed. Our only regret was we were not able to spend more than a single night there.  Amanda was friendly and available if I needed anything. The apartment included some nice touches upon my arrival, such as a full water pitcher and a bowl of fruit. The bed was very cozy, and the apartment was quiet and conducive to sleep. I\\'d recommend the apartment to those visiting Seattle who want to get a feel for life in one of the city\\'s great neighborhoods.  Very pleased with the room.  Amanda was a great host - communication was great and the place was easy to find.  Clean and she even had brownies and fruit waiting.  Highly recommend. A beautiful apartment in a cool part of Seattle. We arrived late and were able to get in without any problems and were welcomed with delicious brownies! The neighbourhood is quiet, has great food nearby and only a 15 minute drive to downtown Seattle. Highly recommend if you\\'ll have access to a car and want to be a little further from the hustle and bustle. Our stay in Ballard with Amanda was a fantastic experience. Everything was as shown, and Amanda was more than willing to help with any questions we had. The neighborhood was better than we could have hoped. We would definitely stay again! Amanda was a tremendous, extremely hospitable host -- she was easy to communicate with, and very graciously let me drop off my luggage before my official check-in. The apartment was clean and well-outfitted and it\\'s located on a lovely, quiet street in Ballard, but it\\'s a short walk to several bars/restaurants (definitely check out Essex!) and only a 20-minute walk to everything on Market Street. I\\'d highly recommend it.  We had a great stay at Amanda\\'s home in Ballard. The apartment was just as described in the listing.  Amanda was so kind, friendly and hospitable. We stayed for 2, non-consecutive nights and check-in was easy both times.  Delicious brownies and fruit were waiting for us upon arrival. Amanda gave us a great recommendation for dinner, which was easily the best meal we ate throughout our entire 10 day trip. I loved the Ballard neighborhood and hope that I\\'ll be able to return, explore a bit more, and stay at Amanda\\'s again. Very comfortable place to stay! Lovely brownies and coffee!!! Thanks for the last minute accommodations!  Amanda\\'s Ballard apartment was super cute and comfy! The neighborhood was quiet, safe, and convenient to everything. She even left us yummy organic snacks that were greatly appreciated. We had a great stay and would definitely stay again next time we are in Seattle. We very much enjoyed our stay in Seattle and at Amanda\\'s place in particular. The neighborhood is beautiful, green and quiet, and Amanda\\'s place clean, well equipped and very comfortable. Amanda had some delicious welcome brownies for us, and some great insider tips about how to get the most out of our time in Seattle. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you so very much!  Lovely lovely home in a great neighborhood.  Amanda was a wonderful host, and really thought of all the details.  We definitely stay again! The apartment was easy to find, clean, and perfect our trip. Amanda was very helpful and friendly and we enjoyed our stay. Amanda\\'s room was perfect. Clean and in a great location. Cafes and transportation into Seattle nearby. She provided entry for me even though she was not home. I would stay there again! Amanda is an amazing host. This was our first AirBnB experience and it was perfect. The room was immaculate, modern, great design, and very comfortable. She went out of her way to provide the amenities that made it way better than any hotel stay. Amanda was very helpful in providing info about the sights and all there is to see in the area. We wanted to experience the local vibe and Ballard was perfect for that!  Amanda is a very gracious host and provides a very comfortable room with everything we needed for our stay.  And the brownies and cherries were a special treat.  We hope to stay there again. This was our first time staying at an Airbnb, and we absolutely loved it.  The place was exactly as described - quiet, lovely, perfect for walking to cool restaurants, and for exploring the area.  It was a very clean, cheerful, restful apartment in a great neighborhood. The host, Amanda, was so friendly and made us feel very welcome . We asked her for recommendations for restaurants/cafes we could walk to from her place and she gave us the greatest tips - excellent choices! We would definitely return to Amanda\\'s place and highly recommend it to all interested travelers.\\r\\n We stayed for 3 nights in June and had a wonderful experience. Amanda is a very thoughtful and generous host who understands the unique needs of travelers with kids (we have a 5-yr-old); she has thought of everything! We spent most of our time each day visiting with family (and thus could not make full use of all the facilities she offered), but it was a relief having this apartment as a base. We are thankful for Amanda\\'s hospitality and would love to stay at the apartment whenever we visit Seattle next. We had a great time staying with Amanda. Her place is very cute and comfy and she has extra amenities if you forget some. We would definitely recommend this place. Thanks Amanda! We had a great visit! The place was exactly as described, and even exceeded our expectations with coffee and breakfast bars provided.  Amanda was very welcoming, allowing us access early and giving us great tips for things to do in Seattle. The brownie was also much appreciated! Great little place with everything you could need and in a fantastic location. Amanda\\'s place was a very nice and cozy room. Some of the accommodations included quick breakfast snacks, milk/soy milk in the fridge, and brownies she made herself! Amanda greeted us during our stay and even recommended a local bakery called Honore which was absolutely delicious. Overall it was a very pleasant stay. This is a clean cute little apartment. It is only 5-6 miles away from the City of Seattle! It is very quiet and comfortable! Amanda is a great host, very accommodating and makes yummy brownies.  Her apartment  has everything you could possibly need, it\\'s in a nice neighborhood and walking distance to stores and restaurants.  We would definitely stay there again!   Amanda was very hospitable and gave great tips about places to eat nearby!  The space was clean and comfortable.  It was a great place to relax after walking around and exploring Fremont / Ballard during a hot afternoon. We stayed at Amanda\\'s for one night. Everything was as described - clean and comfortable in a quiet neighborhood. Amanda was a great host and left us instructions, brownies and fruit. Access to Seattle was easy. We enjoyed staying here! What a wonderful place to stay on our visit of Seattle!  Amanda\\'s place was extremely clean & comfortable!  The neighborhood was quiet & an easy walk to some nearby great restaurants!  Staying in Ballard proved to be a great choice while exploring other parts of Seattle - very convenient!  Amanda was super helpful & a gracious host who gave us many recommendations during our stay.  She made us feel at home & even left us a delicious brownie treat when we arrived!  We would highly recommend her place to friends & hope to return on a future trip!   Great little spot! Super comfortable bed, nice linens and provided amenities. Cute neighborhood with awesome restaurants nearby.  We cannot begin to describe how amazing our stay at Amanda\\'s place was. The apartment is very cozy, clean and has a great bed (and the best hand soap ever). It\\'s located in a very peaceful neighbourhood in close proximity of downtown Ballard, which has a lot of nice restaurants, cute shops and a wonderful movie theatre.\\nThe absolute best thing about our trip were our hosts Amanda, her daughter Luisa and the two cats. Their door was always open, they had some great advice on where to go and what to see and Amanda was so kind to show us a few things herself.  We left with a very warm feeling and two friends richer.\\nWe highly recommend Amanda\\'s to everybody and hope to see them again one day! I, my wife, and two kids stayed at Amanda\\'s guest house for 2nights. The room was big enough to stay for my family. The sofa bed was just like a normal double bed. Although the bathroom was separated from the room, we could use it as our private bathroom because it was just across the corridor and we were the only one who use it. In the second evening of our stay, we met the host, Amanda and we had a talk about Seattle and my country, South Korea. It was so fun and she was very nice. We could make a good memory in Seattle thanks to Amanda. :) Sweet little room in a nice community. Great restaurants nearby.  The host was communicative and helpful.  What a treat! We felt right at home the whole time. It\\'s the little things that make all the difference and Amanda got em all right, from the brownies to the bathroom amenities. The studio was warm and cozy and Ballard (neighborhood) offered plenty of \\'off the beaten path\\' options if you\\'re looking to get away from the downtown area. We\\'d be lucky to stay here again if we\\'re back in Seattle. Great experience with Amanda! She was very warm and welcoming and helped us plan our trip. She even gave us an old cooler! The room was very clean and came with yummy brownies and some fruit. Thanks again! Amanda was so great!\\r\\nShe was super available and helpful.\\r\\nWe had a famous day in Seattle, thanks to her :)\\r\\nHighly recommend this rental to all visitors.\\r\\nLoved the neighborhood as well. We really enjoyed our time at Amanda\\'s! Nice amenities and very welcoming. Great neighborhood and close to everything. We also loved that the room stayed cool during a very warm week in Seattle. We highly recommend Amanda\\'s place and have already suggested it to another friend that may need future accommodations in Ballard. Amanda was a very considerate host.  She was easy to communicate with, and kindly gave us a heads up a Block Party happening on her block, which would have impacted our parking.  But, with her information we were able to arrive early enough to even enjoy the party.  Amanda was fabulous with our twin toddlers, bringing out toys for them to play with and entertaining them a bit while we unpacked the car.  The apartment was lovely, pretty colors, and nice things.  We look forward to returning some day.  Thanks for the hospitality, beautiful home, and sweet neighborhood.  The neighborhood rocked!! Great little shops, parks, restaurants all within walking distance. The stay was wonderful! The bed was comfy, and the set up was awesome. It was nice to be able to stay in a neighborhood instead of a hotel. Amanda was amazing! She was there if I had any questions about Seattle and checked in to make sure the stay was going well. She left yummy brownies for when we arrived! I would definitely stay here again!  Finding an affordable place to stay in Seattle is tough. This really fit the bill. Very quiet at night and nice Private space. Amanda was very helpful, even baked brownies for us. We took the Rapid Ride bus right into downtown. Took about 40 minutes, but was an easy trip. Room and bathroom were very clean. Found good places to run and eat in Ballard. Amanda was in holidays but left us indications and excellent brownies and plums from the backyard! The room is set in a formerly garage but there is space, no moisture and it is well equiped. Just some dust here and there. \\nTwo near bus lines can reach downtown Seattle in 30 minutes. Good location.  Everything was described. Amanda was awesome! Even though she was on a trip herself, she managed to get everything set up and ready for our arrival, including welcome brownies! She also has great suggestions for anything you would want to eat or see. Parking was pretty easy to find on the street, if not, there\\'s a parking spot in from of the house that we could use. I would definitely stay at her home again. We had a great time at Amanda\\'s Studio in Seattle, comfortable with nice , up and coming neighborhoods. There is some cool cafes and restaurants not so far from her place, Amanda gave us some cool addresses in the area. Everything went smoothly , she\\'s been so helpful.\\nI absolutely recommend her place.\\n\\nLe studio est tout à fait confortable, bien situé dans un quartier bien sympathique  Amanda est une personne super gentille et accueillante, \\nNous avons ainsi passé un agréable, court séjour à Seattle. \\n\\nシンプルで、快適なAmandaさんのワンルームアパートは、シアトルの静かな住宅街にあり、周辺にはトレンディーなカフェやレストランが幾つか点在してして、沢山の発見がありました。ホストのアマンダさんは、外国人に英語を教えている先生なので、英語圏以外の方以外でもすぐに打ち解けることができます。滞在中には大変親切にしていただきました！オススメの貸しアパートです。 We all loved staying with Amanda! The apartment is clean, spacious and includes all amenities you could ever need - tea, coffee, cutlery, laundry.\\n\\nAmanda was incredibly knowledgable about her area and even gave us a little tour around the Ballard neighbourhood which was incredibly sweet of her.\\n\\nFinally, the freshly baked brownies on arrival were a lovely little treat :)! Logement spacieux, propre, amanda vous accueille chaleureusement avec des gâteaux maison délicieux. Accessibilité du centre de seattle rapide, il faut prendre un bus a 5 minutes.     Amanda replied to my emails promptly and concisely. She gave excellent directions on how to reach her apartment via the light rail from the airport, taking the Rapid D bus to 70th Street, then walking the short distance to her house, finding the key as she had described. We were greeted with a plate of brownies and a bowl of apples upon our arrival.\\r\\n   The apartment could not have been more comfy and welcoming, making us feel right at home. The bed was a comfortable queen, and the small sofa with lots of pillows faced a flat screen TV with Directv. There was a microwave with teas and instant cereals. Amanda had thought of everything from ace bandages for sore feet to hair mouse for those who hate to pay the airline baggage fee and travel light. Lamps were on each side of the bed-most welcome for those of us who like to read at night. The linens, towels, and bath products were luxurious. Everything was neat and clean. We did not use the backyard, but she had a nice space with lots of flowers, some of which she had placed in small vases within the apartment.\\r\\n   Walking a couple blocks down the street was Delaney\\'s Pizza. The pizza was good, but the salads looked really good. Wish I had had the salad! Breakfast the next morning atThe French Hen (across the  street from Delaney\\'s) was a treat. Make sure to arrive early!\\r\\n   But what makes this apartment special is Amanda herself. She has such an outgoing, friendly manner that makes you feel like a long, lost friend. After inquiring about her ragdoll cat, Monzo, she brought him downstairs to visit. When she found we were going to the locks, she offered to drive us, taking us on a roundabout tour of Ballard including Golden Gardens Park north of the locks.\\r\\n   Without a doubt, I would return in a minute and recommend her apartment to others. Ballard has an old-town feel, it is quieter than downtown Seattle, there are many restaurants and interesting shops, and it is a quick bus ride to downtown Seattle. Thank you, Amanda, for such a wonderful experience! Amanda is a very very nice host, we all like her, her house also very comfertable, we enjoy our days in Seattle.\\nIt\\'s a good choice to stay in Amanda\\'s\\nhouse. Amanda was so hospitable from first communication! The room was lovely. Very comfortable and clean. This was our first time using Airbnb and Amanda made it a wonderful stay!  Amanda\\'s place was really lovely, comfortable.\\nAlso quite convenient place,not so far from dawn town Seattle. If I have a chance to go there, I\\'ll be stay there again 100%. Amanda\\'s unit was very cute and comfortable, and in a great location! Amanda was really helpful, and she left some amazing brownies for us, as well as fresh fruit on arrival. She provided all the toiletries etc you would need if you\\'d forgotten anything - very thoughtful. Thanks heaps Amanda ! Amanda\\'s place was great! The neighborhood was lovely and so well situated. We were very comfortable here and wished we could stay longer. She recommended some great restaurants and had a very friendly cat to boot.\\r\\n I\\'ve stayed at AirBnB\\'s across the country and Amanda\\'s place in Seattle\\'s Ballard neighborhood has been my favorite by far. Great, quiet neighborhood walkable to some awesome restaurants. Nice room and bathroom (which also has heated floors!), comfortable couch, and clean furnishings throughout. Amanda left us brownies and fruit, too, which was the cherry on top. Highly recommended. We have just stayed at Amanda\\'s flat for 10 days. Amanda was wonderful host who provided lots of extra special touches like fresh fruit/flowers and a lovely welcome gift of home made brownies. The flat was just perfect and felt like \\'home from home \\'. I would highly recommend staying at this lovely flat if your are planning a trip to wonderful Ballard. We certainly will be!  Perfect apartment- comfortable furnishings and well laid out. \\nAmanda made the whole process very simple & had lots of Seattle information available to make decisions on what to see & do during my visit very simple. \\nThe welcome Chocolate Brownies were fabulous- should have asked for the recipe. \\nWould definitely recommend this Airbnb to others.  Amanda was a great host. Her room provides all the necessary amenities and comfort. She is a warm and welcoming person and provided a great environment to rest after checking out the sitting Amanda was a wonderful host and the room was great with lots of nice little touches like fresh, homemade brownies on arrival. Easy to get the rapid ride bus to downtown Seattle for only $2.50. Would definitely recommend and would stay there again :) Amanda was a great host! She was very accommodating of my desire to check in a little early and do some laundry. The room is clean and cozy and has lots of nice touches from all the toiletries I needed in the bathroom to a variety of teas and brownies when I arrived! The house is also well located, walking distance to lots of good coffee and food, and a short drive or bus to other great Seattle spots.  Amanda was a wonderful host! A delicious plate of brownies greeted us upon arrival and the space was very comfortable, perfect for my husband, 6 month old son and myself. \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate entrance, plenty of closet space for our things, fruit, granola bars, oatmeal,  coffee & tea were all available and very much appreciated. We had a lovely stay! Amanda\\'s place was perfectly situated and had everything we needed and more. She even baked us some brownies! There is a fridge, hot water for tea, and felt like a bonafide hotel but with the comfort of a home. A great and comfortable space, I highly recommend her place for any trip you have in Seattle! The PERFECT place to rest your head when visiting Ballard and beyond. Steps away from the bus, and so cozy and private. Amanda was the best host, going way above and beyond expectations even allowing us to stay an extra night in her daughter\\'s room because of a travel snafu. We LOVED it! \\r\\n\\r\\n Amanda is an amazing host! Her home was perfect for our stay in the Ballard area. Hospitality is definitely one of Amanda\\'s gifts as we arrived to wonderful brownies as well as breakfast food being provided! She even made bath toys available for our 10 month old son! Thank you so much! We would recommend you and your place to anyone!  Staying in this apartment was ideal. Amanda provides an incredibly comfortable, clean, warm, and inviting space. This place has lots of privacy, no hassle getting in and out, and is in a great neighborhood. She thinks of all the little details so you\\'re taken care of. \\r\\n\\r\\nBallard is awesome, and still has a mix of trendy places you have to wait in line for -and- unassuming local favorites that have been around forever. This apartment is a little outside of all that, nestled amongst cute old houses. There\\'s a cluster of great places just a few blocks away, and then even more to the North and South. An easy 30-minute walk gets you to heart of Ballard, or you can drive and park with relative ease.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeriously, this is absolutely my new home base for any Seattle visits in the future! The place is awesome, really comfortable and greatly equipped. Amanda left brownies, fruits and things in the fridge, so it was also very welcoming the moment we got in. The neighborhood is also super nice. I can only say it is the place to stay when visiting Seattle, close to a lot of places for eating and for walking. Amanda was also approachable and always friendly. Would deffinitely recommend this place to anyone. Also, that bed is magical, you can sleep for fourteen hours or more and still not want to get up. This was my first time using Airbnb and it was amazing! The place is clean, comfortable and easily accessible. There is a separate entrance and bathroom, so you do not have to worry about disturbing anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis place is very spacious. There is a mini fridge and various snacks that Amanda provides (including some homemade brownies!). There is also a microwave and water heater available for use as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bed is very comfortable and warm (which is good because it got a bit chilly due to the fall weather). There is also a pull out sofa bed and a desk that can seat two people. If you need, there is a washer/dryer that Amanda lets you use, which I found very convenient because I was traveling from another city and I only brought enough clothes to fit in my carry-on. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the best things about this place was that it was easy to find. There are lights that outline the doorway, so that it is easy to figure out which house to pull up to in the neighborhood. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother great thing about this place was there was a lot of places that were within walking distance (~20 minute walks, which isn\\'t too far in my opinion). I didn\\'t rent a car while I was out there, so being able to walk around the neighborhood and find a good coffee shop was great. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda was a fantastic host! She was friendly and flexible with my schedule (I had a late flight coming in to Seattle and my cousin decided to join me last minute). Plus, she had some great recommendations for me as this was my first time in Seattle. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis will be my go-to place whenever I visit Seattle!!  Amanda was able to accommodate us (and our bikes!) for a one-night stay on fairly short notice. The house and guest entrance were easy to find, and the space was as expected/listed. Really appreciated all the little touches (lots of backup toiletries in the bathroom, snacks in the suite, etc) that made our brief stay easier. Had a short and pleasant chat with Amanda shortly after we got in, and I think we would have enjoyed settling into the suite/exploring more of the neighbourhood had our trip been longer. Thanks again, Amanda! Staying at your place was great! Very clean and cozy and welcoming. Thank you so much!  Amanda was a great host and her place was great. My parents stayed here, and they loved the brownies, fresh fruit, and heated tile floors in the bathroom! They said it was quiet and comfortable.  This is a lovely, comfortable room with everything you could want for a wonderful stay including a heated bathroom floor - it felt so elegantly decadent!  You can make freshly ground coffee at your leisure in the morning and chill your wine in the little fridge for the evening.  The delicious warm brownies waiting when we arrived late in the evening and the Sunday New York Times awaiting our return from breakfast later in our visit made us feel very cared for.  So many little kind details but the best was our warm friendly hostess Amanda.  We definitely hope to have an occasion to visit again. Our stay at Amanda\\'s was exactly what we wanted. Cozy, warm, comfortable, and safe feeling away from home. We came in late due to unforeseen events, and Amanda made it easy to just come on in and settle in after a long drive. The room is in the middle of a cute neighborhood, easy walking distance to Delancey pizza-which was sooo good :) and other little neighborhood stores. Easy drive to downtown. There are heated floors in the restroom, made such a difference in the cold weather. Thanks for everything, it was great! We had a lovely stay at Amanda\\'s home. It was easy to find the location, and she greeted us after we arrived. And when Is say \"greeted\" I mean \"said hello and provided yummy brownies\"! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was quite comfortable, and I appreciated the provided tea and coffee. The bedroom and bathroom we quite clean. We experienced no noise issues, and the bed was quite comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe home is in a great location —\\xa0walking distance from wonderful places to eat and we enjoyed three of those locations! I only wish we had stayed longer so we could visit a few more. \\r\\n\\r\\nMany thanks to Amanda for making our stay so very pleasant. I just returned home from 4 days in Seattle.  We had a wonderful stay at Amanda\\'s!  It is a quiet neighborhood, easy to find, and Amanda left us with directions of what to do if she wasn\\'t home when we arrived.  Also, correspondence with Amanda was always quick and responsive.  The room has a small fridge, microwave, and is stocked with  assorted teas and light breakfast offerings of fresh fruit and granola bars.  Such a nice touch.  Best of all we were welcomed with fresh brownies when we arrived!  I\\'m looking forward to our next stay,  that is already booked, at Amanda\\'s in February! This place was a true gem! Amanda made us feel so welcome by leaving us a nice note wishing me a happy birthday and a plate with 2 tasty brownies! She greeted us upon arrival, made sure we had everything we needed, and told us to enjoy ourselves. The bed was comfy and the heated tiles in the bathroom were amazing! The Ballard area was very quaint and the short drive to downtown was easy. We will absolutely stay with Amanda again on our next trip to Seattle! Amanda was a great host! Her apartment was centrally located to many area shops. The description of her apartment was right on. My husband and I enjoyed our trip. We would definitely recommend her to anyone. Thank you for being so accommodating.  Carol and her husband are friendly and engaging hosts -- it was a pleasure to meet them and stay in their home.  Both rooms are large and comfortable.  The larger room has a wonderful view of the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound.  The shared bath is large and pleasant.  The house is in a quiet Seattle neighborhood, with quick access to Sunset Park (with its wonderful views) and right above Golden Gardens -- a great place for a swim or a run by the Sound.  Carol and her husband hosted my father while he was in town to meet his granddaughter. They could not have been lovelier to him!  The house is very nice with beautiful views and the room is great.  My father really enjoyed the neighborhood where he could walk to  coffee and lunch everyday. He raved about how gracious the hosts were and how much he enjoyed the accommodations. We would recommend this place to anyone!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n carol and her husband were wonderful hosts! sweet, informative, and hospitable. especially loved the all-organic food and the tempurpedic shower mat!!!!  Carol and Bruce were so accommodating and lovely. We loved the view of the sound, the mountains and the sound of seals below the house. The location was perfect for us and very close the the bus line. Meeting Quasar was an extra bonus. Carol responded immediately when an unfortunate situation left us without a place to stay upon arriving in Seattle. The house is large and beautiful and pretty close to the key bus stations. The room is quaint and comfortable. We really appreciated having breakfast and coffee available in the mornings and our own bathroom to use. The backyard also looks out over Puget Sound and the view is so peaceful and great! Carol and Bruce were very accommodating and willing to answer any questions we had. I especially loved having Quasar the Wonder Dog around! We loved our stay with Carol and Bruce.  The home was lovely and the view from our room magnificent.  Carol and Bruce created a very inviting environment with a continental breakfast each morning.  Having use of the mini kitchen items (small fridge, toaster, etc) made it convenient to store some food and enjoy breakfast.  The home is quiet and comfortable and we loved the vibe.  The home is located around the corner from a lovely park with one of the best views of Puget Sound.  We spent our visit walking around the neighborhood and down the hill into the town of Ballard.  Having a separate bathroom for our personal use was also very nice.  They have a very sweet golden doodle named Quasar the Wonderdog who will happily greet you when you arrive.  If driving, there is plenty of parking and the bus stop is right around the corner.  Easy communication with Carol, a lovely view and home, they even gave us some veggies from the garden! Carol and Bruce are excellent hosts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have a lovely home, with a beautiful view of the Puget Sound. The beach is a short walk / drive away.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir home is about a hour\\'s drive from the airport in commute-time traffic, and about 35 mins otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarol got in touch with me before my trip and was kind enough to arrange a breakfast of my preference for the one day I was staying with them. The room was cozy, and the bed was comfortable. They also have a very friendly dog, who I wish I had more time to play with. The room is indeed cozy as well as blissfully quiet. Carol took great pains to make me feel welcome, and to explain everything about the neighborhood, my room and breakfast options. The house motto should be \"If we don\\'t have it, you don\\'t need it.\" Because there was everything imaginable, from soaps and shampoos to powdered cinnamon for my oatmeal. Plus Quasar the Wonder Dog, whose only fault is that he won\\'t play fetch. I would highly recommend staying with Carol. Very comfortable room, great location, nice breakfast with fresh fruit, cereal etc. Carol is a gracious host and I would stay here again. It\\'s a good location if you have a car, close to Ballard restaurants, Golden Gardens and Shilshole.  I found it to be a real pleasure to stay there - the hospitality and\\r\\nbreakfast delightful!  Very friendly reception. Great location. I enjoyed the discussions. I had a wonderful stay at Carol\\'s B&B in Ballard, Seattle. She is very friendly, nice and open and made me feel welcome from the start with all important information ready upon my arrival. I was also greeted by the family\\'s very friendly and goof natured dog.\\r\\n Because there were no other guests expected I got a free upgrade to the more spacious room with a gorgeous see view I enjoyed very much during breakfast. \\r\\nAll facilities were in good shape an clean. The breakfast was very good too with fresh fruits, cereals, toast, milk etc.\\r\\nThe neighborhood is a very calm one, with the sea near by, nice little shops and also a very good organic supermarket (Sunsethill Green market).\\r\\nI can definitely recommend this place! Thank you very much again, Carol!! James is a wonderful host with a genuine generous spirit.  Before we arrived and during our stay, James was reliably available and often addressed our questions/needs before we even asked.  \\r\\nThe room and bathroom were as described - clean, simple, and comfortable.  On a suburban street, the neighborhood is both quiet and calm and a brief walk from all the action that Ballard has to offer.\\r\\nAirbnb works when hosts are kind, reliable, honest, and caring.  James is one of them! James was a wonderful host. He made us feel right at home with WiFi, a kitchen to use and the friendly, occasional company of Patty, the dog. He was always willing to give us some tips on getting around, suggestions for places to visit, and restaurants to check out. Would  A great place to stay, recent renovation and well equipped. Nice neighborhood, co-guests delightful. Fantastic Host. Knowledgable about the locality and Seattle interests. A compelling traveler himself. Wow we were welcomed in person by James, really relaxed guy, with great tips on foot, shops and indeed the walk nearby to the Locks was great! House clean and nice, beds very nice matras. James was very friendly! Gave us the rundown and let us be. It was a perfect location to see a part of city for a night.  Awesome experience with Aaron while Jason was away on business. Thank you for being so easy going and available.  We didn\\'t get to meet James but his friend Aaron took good care of the stay. The home was clean and you share a bathroom with guests from another room. Refrigertor and stove were very clean too. The only thing to keep in mind is that they don\\'t provide hairdryer yet (but have been working on it). Sometimes at night you would hear the train, but it didn\\'t bother our sleep much tho. Overall it\\'s a nice place to stay at. Wonderful place with a great location and friendly hosts.  Nice place and convenient location! James was able to accommodate us on a last-minute booking and was friendly, super responsive, and helpful throughout. The room was comfortable and the house was clean. James also gave us some great tips on things to check out in Ballard. James was a very generous and resourceful host. The apartment/rooms that he rents is/are spotless, welcoming and warm. And we spent a great evening in Ballard, fantastic restaurants (we followed james\\' advices and his recommendations were impecable), fun beer \"rooms\" and great coffee. Both james and its house location made our seattle stay a    More than pleasant experience.  Had a great weekend getaway in Ballard. This place is close to lots of cute coffee shops, in a great walkable neighbourhood— and there\\'s an awesome farmers\\' market on Sunday morning. Thanks for making us feel  welcome, James! Definitely be back another weekend. I contacted James at the last minute to book a room in Seattle. He was extremely responsive and flexible with my late pick up of the keys. A 5 minute walk away from the cafes and restaurants.  3 minute walk away from the Ballard locks.  Extremely convenient location and the room was very clean.   This was our first air bnb experience and it was great. James was a wonderful host and our room was perfect for what we wanted. It was within walking distance to the heart of Ballard, so we didn\\'t even have to drive to enjoy a variety of great restaurants and nightlife. The room itself was spotless, the bed comfy and the special touches (plush towels, coffee, bottled water) made us feel at home. Overall, we would recommend James\\' place to anyone!  My boyfriend and I had a great experience staying at James\\' place. We stayed for 9 days and got a good feel for Ballard. This is an awesome location- super walkable to Ballard\\'s downtown area, bus stops, and the Ballard Locks. Very convenient. Easy parking if you have a car, if not you can easily bus/walk/uber. James was great, very friendly, while also giving us our space and kept the apartment clean. We had the unit to ourselves for most of our stay and did share for a few days (it\\'s a 2 bedroom- 1 bathroom). We had great roommates and sharing the place was easy. I would highly recommend booking a stay, you\\'ll love it! Perfect location for easy access to Old Town Ballard (with super-easy access to buses headed to downtown Seattle), great little place in a quiet neighborhood. James was a fantastic host and made sure we felt comfortable whilst giving us plenty of space and privacy to do our own thing. If you want to see Seattle and stay somewhere that is affordable but offers an authentic experience (awesome coffee shops, restaurants, boutiques), James\\'s place in Ballard is perfect. Thanks again, James! James has a great place within walking distance to Old Ballard restaurants, nightlife, and shopping. Very close to bus transit as well. I only had the pleasure of staying with James for one night, but he was flexible with my late arrival time and very welcoming. The room was very clean and as advertised - I would definitely recommend a stay here if you\\'re looking for a home base to explore Seattle from. Thanks! James was awesome.  Met us at a convenient time, welcomed us and gave us a tour.  The house was great and the room was clean and comfortable. The location is quiet and safe, and only a few minutes walk away from lots of bars and restaurants, as well as the locks. Street/driveway parking was free and accessible. Transit to downtown Seattle was easy and only took around 45 minutes.  Staying here was a great decision.  Thanks, James! Bright cozy room. Nice condo in a nice area. 10 minute walk down to restaurants. James was very pleasant and accommodating. Great communication. Shared bathroom if other room is rented out. This was our second time staying at James\\'s place in Ballard (this time for three nights before flying home) and it was perfect again! Everything was just perfect! Quiet neighbourhood, really nice bars and restaurants 10 minutes away, bus connections to downtown, and a beautiful double room in a house that has two bed rooms in total. Thank you, James!  James accommodated my grandma with very little notice, very nice room and bed, clean, crisp, nice attention to detail, bathroom was clean and fresh, nice kitchen. Overall 10/10. Only sad part is we could only get it for one day.      We highly recommend you stay at James\\'s place when visiting the Ballard area. James\\'s house is perfectly located short walking distance to the amazing restaurants & shops in the area. \\r\\n    The listing was exactly as described, very clean & quiet. All the amenities were perfect for our stay. The bed was super comfortable n cozy. James was there to greet us & suggest some great restaurants to try in the area (which we did). \\r\\n   Next time we come to the Seattle area, we will be looking up Jame\\'s listing again. The Ballard area has so much to offer, I wish we were there for longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael & Erica\\r\\nNorth Vancouver, BC James was waiting for us in person when we arrived and gave us a quick welcome and overview of the place, the neighborhood. The place is small, two-floor, two-bedroom 1-bath - basic but clean and comfortable and it was nice to have access to kitchen with fridge. Both bedrooms are for airbnb guests - we had company first night and alone the second night. We were in the Queen room and the bed was comfy. The best part is the location - right in Ballard close to the bike/running trail, locks, all the neighborhood spots. You can follow the trail about 1.5 miles to Golden Gardens Park which has a nice beach. Very clean, comfortable bed, very pleasant host. Would definitely stay there again. This rental is very clean and has recently updated paint and carpet. The location is excellent- residential and still very walkable to downtown Ballard. \\r\\nIt is located close to train tracks. The trains start running early in the morning. Also, this is a rental for ONE of TWO bedrooms that are very close together and share a bathroom. The bedroom doors do not have seperate locks. None of this was a problem for me and the people I shared the house with were very pleasant.  Easy, last minute rental in great location and clean, comfortable place. Plenty of parking on the street. We enjoyed being able to walk to several breweries but did take a bus back. Thanks for a great stay.  James answered any questions we had quickly and seemed genuinely happy to answer them. James was a great host and took time to show us around the place before we settled in. He was welcoming and energetic! The place was clean, cute and comfy. We would definitely stay there again. The place was a quick walk to our favourite dessert place and other bars and social spots.  Nice comfortable bed and room was quiet.  One block away from Fish Locks and restaurants.  I was only in the room to sleep, but it suited my purposes. Really enjoy staying at James\\' b-n-b. It\\'s comfortable and James is so conscientious. Terrific location and an easy trip from the airport. I\\'ll be returning again. James was a lovely host and the house was very, very clean and comfortable. We will definitely try to stay there again should we need to spend the night in the area again! Marcia was awesome!  Very gracious host. She went out of her way to make us feel at home. We cooked a big dinner in her big kitchen and she had everything we needed to do it. This was my first Airbnb experience and I will never forget it. I will definitely stay there again. Thanks :) Marcia was incredibly helpful and gracious!  The bedroom and bathroom are very neat and clean.  Marcia took the time to help me get acquainted with the neighborhood and public transportation.  A great place to stay! Marcia welcomed us to her charming Ballard home and had everything ready for us, even a walking map of the community. We had evening plans and did not get much of a chance to visit with her, but would like to. The room was comfortable and quiet and we enjoyed breakfast out on her patio and a stroll through the pleasant neighborhood, which is close to the Chittenden Locks, an interesting sight if you are in Seattle. Marcia Cote was a tremendous host.  When I mislaid my mobile phone, she assisted me with contacting the parties needed to replace it.  She also did my laundry along with hers and gave me suggestions about what to see in Seattle.  When I come back to Seattle, I will stay at 1914 Craftsman in Sunset Hills.  I felt very welcomed by Marcia, her home, and the neighborhood (set back from busier Ballard a little bit, and near the beautiful Golden Gardens beach). Marcia was very kind and communicative (even considering our busy schedules during my visit!). I would suggest it as a great stay for anyone visiting the Seattle area! The room and bed were comfy, the neighborhood is very quiet.  Marcia was helpful - printed out maps so we could walk to local restaurants.  The 17 bus takes you to Ballard\\'s main drag and to Westlake in downtown Seattle.  I found a great bike rental, Dutch Bikes on Ballard Avenue, so I could have more mobility.  Marcia will let you cook in her kitchen , but don\\'t.  There are terrific restaurants around Market and Ballard, and just north of Marcia\\'s house is an awesome bakery for breakfast that also does lunch and dinner in their cafe next to the bakery.  I think I gained 5 lbs in Seattle. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Dutch Bikes you can follow the river trails around or go into the city.  We went to the arboretum and all around it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThat 17 bus also takes you to Lake Union if you want to kayak around and see the seaplanes come and go and look at the famous houseboats. The location is fantastic, if you enjoy walking.  Great Italian restaurant a few blocks away.  Easy access to downtown Ballard.  Quiet neighborhood which makes sleeping in the front, upstairs bedroom quite wonderful.  The bedroom is large, clean and guest friendly.  Marcia had cookies and chocolates, along with Ballard maps in the room.  The bathroom is sparkling clean. The host is friendly, accommodating and welcoming.  I highly recommend this host/room to anyone visiting the Ballard area.  Marcia was our first hostess on Airbnb.  She was a very gracious & accommodating to our needs  Marcia truly made our first experience worthwhile.  We were only there for one night but she opened up her home to us as if we were family.  Her home is very clean and cozy and full of character.  She had maps of the area and the neighborhood is fantastic!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will stay again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Marcia was a great host! She went out of her way to make me feel at home and even baked cookies and made breakfast for me while I was there! The bed and room was very comfortable. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay there. It was like having a mom away from home. Very clean home in a nice quite neighborhood. Marcia was a wonderful host!  My daughter and I enjoyed staying in her charming home while visiting UW.  Although Marcia was unable to be at the home the day we arrived she checked on us, and made sure we had everything we needed.  When we did meet, she felt like a friend after a short time.  Home, room, and bathroom all very clean.  Comfortable bed. Nice, quiet, safe-feeling neighborhood, yet close to downtown Ballard, the university, and the city.  Several little \"gifts\" were a bonus, such as cookies and tea one afternoon and breakfast (made to order) another morning.  I wholeheartedly recommend staying with Marcia; she was a delight!! It is a privilege to stay at Marcia\\'s.  Genuine care. Went out of the way help us.  Felt very welcome and at home.  Loved the turn of last century house.  Great communication and well organized.   Highly recommended. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Marcia. She is warm and hospitable and we felt at home the moment we arrived. She recommended us some great restaurants which are within walking from her place. Her place was well located for us so getting around was no problem. Enjoyed her company immensely and wished we had more time with her. Definitely recommend. Marcia is a super host! The accomodations were clean, airy, and spacious. The charm of the 1914 Craftsman and incredible hospitality made us feel like we stayed with a favorite family member! Marcia was a wonderful host! We loved staying in her charming, eclectic home and would do it all over again! She went out of her way to make she we had everything we needed and more.The house and neighborhood were both lovely, as were the fresh baked scones! Marcia went out her way in helping me with the logistics of my short stay and I am very appreciative of her help. She is also a great host-she really tries to make guests feel at home. The bedroom I stayed in was extremely quiet  and comfortable..Her house is easily accessed by public transportation. Marcia was a great host.  She greated us with a warm smile and made us feel  at home upon arrival.  The front room where we stayed was clean and very comfortable.  Although it was in the front of the house it was very very quiet.  Ballard is a beautiful community and  close to centertown Seattle. \\r\\n\\r\\nShe recommend beautiful restaurants, also had coupons for us to use.  She also had maps and different visitor\\'s information that was very useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly recommend Marcia and we had a wonderful stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatricia & Alain   Everything was fresh and clean.  I didn\\'t see Marcia all that much, but when I did she was very nice and helpful.  There are many personal touches to this place.  It\\'s a great home base if you are visiting Seattle. Marcia could have been more accommodating and helpful. As someone who does not travel well (I am a stress case) it was very comforting to not only stay in an area like Ballard, which had everything I wanted within walking distance, but also to have a host who knew the area so well and made us feel totally at ease.  Marcia was a kind and gracious host. Her organization and ability to predict our needs such as making available  maps of Seattle helped us to make the most of our time in Seattle. The room was was very clean, well designed, comfortable and warm during our winter stay. On another note, Marcia happens to live in a great find of a district called the Ballard, there is a wonderful restaurant and bar scene just a 5 minute drive from Marcia\\'s house. Blake and I would definitely urge you to stay with Marcia if you are lucky to visit Seattle! Marcia was a great host.  She was thoughtful and very helpful.  The bus line was easy to get to downtown.  The home is very comfortable and we enjoyed our stay with her. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t meet Marcia in person as I got \"home\" too late but my girl-friend met her and said that she was super nice. Also, she clearly puts a lot of attention to details and everything was very well prepared with cute welcome notes and everything. To be recommended! Marcia is an amazing airbnb hostess!  Her instructions were easily followed and her home was tidy and absolutely lovely.  The bedroom I enjoyed for the night was quiet and the bed was fabulously comfy!  Thank you Marcia! Very comfy bed and well equipped accommodation\\r\\nThe neighborhood was as quiet as a prairie grassland campsite,,\\r\\nFriendly welcoming host. \\r\\nI would definitely book again next time I am in Seattle\\r\\n\\r\\n Marcia\\'s place is very nice, very comfortable and it\\'s located in a great neighborhood. Marcia was fantastic..I\\'d definitely stay there again.\\r\\n This place was perfect for us. Marcia is an amazing host, so sweet and considerate and really went out of her way to make our experience great. We have a little 1 year old and so she pulled out old toys and books and was extremely accommodating. We love to cook and so the big kitchen was an awesome bonus! The place is beautifully located - quiet and peaceful, but seconds away from a bus that goes all the way to town and just 8 blocks from a 24 hour supermarket. Marcia\\'s roommate is awesome too - she entertained our little one and helped us out a few times when we needed it! We\\'d definitely stay here again. Marcia\\'s warmth floods her house, it really is a home away from home.  Marcia really went out of her way to make me feel welcome & comfortable.  The area is very pretty, it would suit anyone who wants somewhere quiet to stay, and is just 20mins walk from the thriving bars and restaurants of Ballard.  The bus to downtown stops right at the end of the street, but note that buses run infrequently at night.  For those who want to cook, Marcia\\'s kitchen has any kitchen appliance you might need. Marcia was a GREAT hostess from start to finish. She made me feel welcome long before I got to her home. Her house is really nice, and clean. Marcia works a lot so I did not see her much or her roommate, I felt like I had the place to myself. There is a nice porch out back with a place to sit for coffee in the A.M. My bed was SO comfortable, the room bright and airy. The location is great as well, I had a car and recommend one but public transit it pretty good on Seattle. She took me to a nice breakfast at a local eatery, Patty\\'s Eggnest, a real treat. Marcia had many little \"things\" around the house to make an Airbnb\\'er feel welcome & at home. I am a host myself and I will be \"borrowing\" some of her ideas to add to Jane\\'s Place in Montana. Thanks for a wonderful stay!! My visit  was perfect for what I needed right now in my life. Marcia was a great host, she was very calm, respectful and curtious. She opened her home to a complete stranger. I felt safe and comfortable. We had open and wonderful conversations. Marcia is a real Gem and a really cool person. I would easily stay again at her home and great location the next time I visit Seattle. So Thank You Marcia  Our stay with Marcia was perfect. She\\'s a very kind and thoughtful host. Her place is really welcoming in a lovely neighborhood in Ballard, our room was quiet and clean and we could easily come and go. We brought our bikes and she let us keep them on the enclosed porch for safety. Parking on the street was not an issue. It\\'s a great location for exploring Ballard and Fremont, but a bit further from downtown than we anticipated. A great couple days! Marcia is a gracious hostess, and her home is comfortable and lovely. I hope to stay with her again. Marcia was an ideal host for our first Airbnb experience!  Her home is absolutely charming and in a lovely neighborhood of Seattle.  The second floor room had a beautiful territorial view and an amazingly comfortable bed.  Marcia made us feel instantly welcome, and we cannot recommend staying with her highly enough!   Wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay again or fully recommend to others.  Marcia was happy to chat if we wanted to but was unintrusive otherwise.  Wonderful balance that not all hosts would naturally have. Marcia\\'s hospitality was superb, making us feel at home, as if with new housemates...a home away from home I hope to visit again. She sets a high bar for bnb\\'s. Marcia was flexible with us when our plans changed & we were running late.  She went out of way to accomodate us and get the keys to us since we would be coming back to the house late.  She had everything set up for us and made our stay comfortable.  We would highly recommend her.   Very friendly ! We would recommend Marcia anytime !  I never got to meet Marcia, but she was very helpful and informative by email. Her home was lovely and in a great neighborhood. I definitely hope to stay there again. Great stay, for a 2nd time. Expect to return again when we are in the area.  Marcia is a lovely host.  Love her little room and her lovely home.  She is a wonderful host, her communication is excellent.  Highly recommend. Marcia made it possible for my friend and I to easily locate her house and traverse the surrounding area with ease. Her home is in a great location about 30 min bus ride from downtown, and a few minutes walk from a cool little each hangout. I will be looking forward to stay with Marcia again :) We had such a wonderful time staying at Marcia\\'s home. She was completely welcoming and made us feel comfortable. We loved being so close to everything in Ballard and spent a lot of time there. \\r\\nShe was very thoughtful and had a shelf in the kitchen and space in the fridge for us to store food if we needed to. \\r\\nI completely recommend her and would definitely stay with Marcia again if we are in the area.  Although our encounter with Marcia was brief, she was a very kind and thoughtful host.  Her home and the surrounding area are gorgeous and relaxing.  I highly recommend spending time here if you\\'re in the Seattle area.   Marcia was super nice and welcoming. Our room was comfortable, the house had a lot of character, and it was on a nice quiet leafy-green street. Marcia was extremely helpful during our stay. I would highly recommend.  My stay at Marcia\\'s was absolutely perfect.  It was clean and darling and Marcia was warm and friendly but very unobtrusive.  I would recommend her and her home to anyone.  My husband and I enjoyed our brief stay at Marcia\\'s charming home. We did rent a car and the house was easy to locate. For walkers the house is  about a 15 minute walk east to a street bustling with restaurants and shops. We walked eight minutes west to have a traditional seafood style dinner on the water! As for the house we felt that the value was great. Large windows poured in natural light and detailed instructions left us feeling confidant about important things like bathrooms and coffee. We spoke with Marcia briefly but our time was pleasantly private. There is one full bath located upstairs where the airbnb room, Marcia\\'s room, and Marcia\\'s roomate\\'s room are all located, and a half bath on the main level. We recommend Marcia\\'s home! Also the bed provided a GREAT night\\'s sleep after a long day of travel. All I can say is \"WOW!\" I was in Seattle for 3 weeks and Marcia opened her home to me completely! It was wonderful to experience Seattle from a resident\\'s perspective. Marcia ensured I had everything I needed and added some special welcoming touches as well. I would highly recommend Marcia\\'s for anyone looking for a place to stay for a night, a week, or longer. The bed was great, the room was great, and the hostess is one of those special people with a big heart. A pure pleasure staying here! My boyfriend and I spent 5 fabulous nights at Marcia\\'s beautiful craftsman home. She was a wonderful host. Rene and I instantly felt at home which is such a hard thing to find when travelling. I would recommend Marcia to anyone travelling to the Seattle area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location was perfect! Only a 5-10 minute drive to the heart of Seattle. Marcia was a wonderful host, eager to give recommendations of her favorite coffee spots in the area. Although our passing was only brief, Marcia made me feel at home in a city I had no clue about. Her house is beautiful and very clean. When I come back for another visit to Seattle I hope I can stay with Marcia again! Marcia is an incredibly warm and helpful host. In her beautiful house I felt immediately at home. I was there for three weeks and I was simply very sorry to leave. The location is perfect to enjoy the best of Seattle, in Ballard there are so many exciting things to do, even at a walking distance. Marcia was a wonderful host! She was warm and friendly and very helpful, made us feel right at home. The house is beautiful and clean and cozy, we wished we were staying longer and would certainly come back!  Marcia and I never met, but I saw another renter at the house. The bed was very comfortable and the house is very close to the Ballard Locks where the salmon run museum is. The rent is very reasonable. I would come again and recommend it to others. My boyfriend and I came up to Seattle for a night, and stayed with Marcia. Her home is lovely, and she was so helpful and kind. Ballard was a great neighborhood to walk around, and Marcia made it easy for us to come and go throughout the day. Would definitely recommend to others and would definitely come back to stay next time we\\'re in Seattle!  Marcia was an awesome host and her home is beautiful. Though we didn\\'t get to spend much time with her, she was so gracious and thoughtful. I wish we were able to take advantage of the kitchen and garden a bit more but we weren\\'t there enough. I highly recommend staying with marcia and I would personally come back over and over when I am in the area.  Meeting Marcia in person was like visiting an old and dear friend. I arrived at night, having never been in Seattle and traveling alone I felt very comfortable staying at Marcia\\'s.  I love older homes and Marcia has done an amazing job preserving the character of her home.  The new rain gardens are beautiful and during the day looking out the big windows from the room with the gardens below is so charming. Great meals and great conversations. Highly recommend.  Thank you Marcia!\\r\\nI arrived after Marcia left for work and met Mirna and had a little chat with her. As I was so tired after my flight from Europe I just took a shower and went to bed - very cosy and comfortable room. The next morning I drove to Golden Garden and had a long morning walk! Perfect for my first day in the Seattle area - after buying fresh salmon at Pike Place at 8.30am I continued my journey to Idaho.\\r\\nMarcias place was fantastic for all my needs. I recommend staying in Ballard!g What a great stay we had at this charming home by the sound.  Everything is walking distance.  Best of all is the sweet hostess Marcia. She is a wonderful gracious host.  Her home is inviting and warm.  We came as strangers and left as friends.  We were able to get around town easily and traveled into Seattle to see all the tourist stuff but found ourselfs drawn back to the wonderful area of Ballard.  It\\'s a can\\'t miss spot with tons to do.  We walked to dinner, saw a great show at the Sunset Tavern and during the day explored the Locks and Botanical Gardens.Ray\\'s Cafe was a great meal and perfect spot to give you the feel of a true meal by the sea.  All good here and recommend this to anyone. What a wonderful place to stay. The house is a lovely old craftsman, the room is spacious and clean and the neighbourhood is delightful.  As others have said Marcia ia a warm and welcoming host.  I hopec o use this room as a base for future visits to Seattle.  I would recoomend this place to anyone. Marcia\\'s home is lovely and she is so welcoming. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We return to Seattle regularly to visit family and Marcia\\'s home will be our first choice! Marcia was a gracious host. Has a great home in the highly desirable Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, within walking distance of fantastic restaurants, and beautiful views of the Puget Sound.  The was clean, quiet room, with a very comfortable bed.  Marcia eagerly shared her wealth of knowledge and enthusiasm for Seattle.  It was fun talking with her.  I felt welcomed. Marcia was an amazing hostess. She welcomed us into her house and make us feel right at home. My daughter and I spent two nights in her home and loved it. Her home is in a great location to walk downtown and to get around to all of the sights that we wanted to see on our visit. Marcia was very friendly and helpful and being able to use the kitchen was a bonus! Second time here and that says it all for me!  I knew the lay of the land and it was like going home, my second home.  Marcia had time to help me get to Trader Joe\\'s for food.  We were able to share a great morning walk that included the most important stops; coffee, scones, yarn, picking up friends.  My short walk to the Ballard Senior Center where the Ling Gui Qi Gong seminar is held is so close.  Again, comfortable bed, warm shower, very welcoming host, why stay any where else.  Thanks again Marcia, until next.  Marcia was an excellent host and her house is awesome. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bedroom was big and clean.\\r\\nThe bed was amazingly comfortable.\\r\\nThe neighborhood was very cool and close to plenty of fun things to do.\\r\\nMarcia is super sweet and willing to help you out in any way possible.\\r\\nIf you\\'re staying in Seattle, this is definitely the house to stay at. Our stay at Marcia\\'s house was nothing less than amazing. My friend and I stayed with Marcia for over 25 days and every single one was better than the last. She didn\\'t treat us like guests... she treated us like members of the family. We were even given the opportunity to have Thanksgiving with her which was a blast! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire time Marcia went out of her way to help us with anything we needed from time to time. During this time she was always super friendly and willing to do anything in her power to make us feel more comfortable. On some days where it seemed the rain would never subside (I know right Seattle!) she even gave us a ride if she wasn\\'t busy! \\r\\n\\r\\nHer house was always super clean and extremely well kept. My friend is very OCD and even he thought Marcia did a fantastic job of keeping everything up to an extremely high level of quality. We honestly couldn\\'t have choosen a better place to stay for our 25 days... not including the fact it was extremely easy to get to downtown Seattle from her house. A quick 5 minute walk and you would have access to the 40 which brings you right into the heart of Seattle or really anywhere else you would want to go!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend and I were originally from Ohio and we moved to Seattle to \"set up shop\" and begin a new and far more exciting life. It wasn\\'t easy moving 2,500 miles away from our parents but Marcia made the feeling of being \"homesick\" irrelevant. Not only did we meet a wonderful and caring woman we made a great new friend during our time with Marcia. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone who wants to travel to Seattle or at least get to learn about Ballard (which is amazing) should stay with Marcia. I can guarantee you will not be disappointed with your decision! Our stay with Marcia was wonderful. We needed a place to stay after my husband\\'s surgery and wanted to be in Ballard (we used to live in the area). Marcia\\'s house worked out great. We had everything we needed to live (not vacation) for our 2 weeks and it was very comfortable for my husband to recoup. We were able to cook most of our meals since Marcia has a nice, large kitchen and lent us any tool we needed including a cart to roll groceries to the house from the store just a few blocks away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also had plenty of privacy since Marcia has such a busy lifestyle and was rarely home. It was like having the large house to ourselves. Friends and family were able to visit us without any problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe love the Ballard area and needed to get my husband walking to help in his recovery. The location was great to be able to walk to the locks, grocer, bank, movie theatre, coffee shops and historic Ballard. We even did the second Saturday Art Walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarcia was very accommodating and helpful. It also helped that she is a nurse and offered to assist if we needed help with changing dressings or administering shots.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would definitely stay again. Thanks Marcia!! Marcia appoints the room and her kitchen with tremendous care and forethought.  She was very helpful and willing to chat, a very warm and welcoming host.  The room is very warm, comfortable, spacious.  I would definitely book with her again.  She will be top of list of return trips to Seattle.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll plumbing, windows, heaters, locks functioned well.  Really no complaints.  The neighborhood is beautiful.  Near the locks so great in Summer.  A bus stop is literally around the corner, but I opt for catching the #40 to downtown off of 24th since it gets me a nice brusk 5 block walk and some local coffee shops to walk by.  A seamless experience.  Marcia was very graceful and accommodating during my mom\\'s stay at her place. The room was clean, quiet and warm - and Marcia was an amazing host, opening her beautiful home to my mom over the holidays. Marcia was also incredibly flexible and understanding about our checking in and checking out times. Looking forward to staying with her again!   We truly enjoyed staying at Marcia\\'s.  We had a great room with a view of Mt. Rainier (when it wasn\\'t cloudy), the house was very nice and comfortable, and we really appreciated the kitchen privileges. We also enjoyed getting to know Marcia. We highly recommend a Ballard location for getting to know Seattle. Our special treat was a snowy owl roosting several blocks north of Marcia\\'s.  We absolutely loved our stay with Marcia. We were relocating out to Seattle from the east coast and we stayed with Marcia during our first week and a half in Seattle as we looked for an apartment. Her house is in a beautiful location, a short drive to anything you could want in Ballard, which offers lots of great shops and amazing restaurants. Her house itself is a beautifully maintained, decorated, and super clean craftsman with so much character. Marcia let us use her kitchen as much as we wanted and was really flexible when we needed to stay a few extra days. One awesome unexpected perk was the beautiful view of Mount Rainier from the cozy bedroom window on a clear day.  Marcia was such a sweet hostess and we couldn\\'t have asked for a better introduction to our new life in Seattle. Great place to stay in Ballard in a nice craftsman house, nice neighborhood, with a comfy bed, great hospitality and a warm welcome!  Marcia provided an incredibly warm, welcoming stay in her cozy home in Ballard. My partner and I really appreciated little touches such as notes welcoming us, her flexibility, reliability, coffee, cinnamon buns, and genuine friendliness. It was truly a pleasure staying with her; it felt like staying with family. When she asked us if there was anything else we needed, I couldn\\'t think of anything she hadn\\'t already provided. Thank you Marcia! I love this place.  Marcia was a great Host and the space was\\r\\nuber convenient places of interest in Ballard.\\r\\nThanks Marcia .   Sincerely Eva My boyfriend and I really enjoyed staying with Marcia in her beautiful home in a wonderful neighborhood. Her house was warm and full of light, and our room was so comfortable; we felt very much at home. Marcia was such a thoughtful and helpful host and she really makes sure that you have all that you need. We really appreciated all of her helpful notes around the house, and the many city brochures she kept in our room. Marcia is such a warm person and was a delight to talk to; we wish we could have stayed longer and spoken more! We would definitely love to stay with her again when we are back in Seattle. Thoroughly lovely long weekend w/my girls at Marcia\\'s.  We all enjoyed, again, Marcia\\'s lovely home in this Ballard neighborhood.  It was very relaxing, cozy, homey.  We enjoyed visiting the Ballard farmer\\'s market, nearby Greenlake, and even south Whidbey Island.  Marcia\\'s place has become a great \"2nd home\" for us when visiting our daughter at UW.  Marcia is a considerate and thoughtful host and I look forward to our next stay.  Highly recommend!! Lovely home and hostess.  Very convenient loacation.  Will return, happily. Close to the salty water in a upscale neighbourhood a comfortable room with a view.\\r\\nMarcia is a very welcoming host, easygoing, social with a super interesting job in the icu.\\r\\nThanks Marcia! I don\\'t believe we could have had a better host than Marcia. A beer waiting for us upon arrival, not to mention a last minute stay that she bent over backwards to accommodate!\\r\\n\\r\\nExtremely clean home, terrific location in Ballard near buses/beach/parks, enormous amount of information available for the tourist type. I was only there for a quick business trip, but if you had more time Marcia seems to be a wealth of information.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarcia also was a great host in that she saw my brother and I were both exhausted from the day and allowed us our privacy and an early bed time. \\r\\n\\r\\nCouldn\\'t be happier, STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!! My girlfriend and I only stayed at Marcia\\'s for one night, but we had an awesome time there. Marcia was a very attentive and kind host and her house is a gem.  The bed is very comfortable and the no-tech, oldie-worldyness of her home makes for a very pleasant retreat - even for one night. it\\'s so much nicer to wake up in the residential streets of Ballard than a I-5 Motel 6 or a crummy downtown hotel. I would definitely come back here! Thanks so much Marcia!   Marcia was a wonderful host and her house was lovely! We would definitely stay with her again if we come back to Seattle. She was knowledgable, friendly, and flexible regarding check-in. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks a ton for hosting us,  \\r\\n\\r\\n-Mari & Stephen Marcia is a very out-going, friendly and helpful. Her room was tidy and cozy and the house was in a great area. Ballard is a little jewel of a neighborhood North of Seattle, just 20 minutes from downtown. The neighborhood has so much to offer as far as hip nightspots and great eats that we only ended up going to Seattle once during the 4 day stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe highly recommend staying with Marcia in this great area. Marcia is the best host you could possibly ask for! She is one of the sweetest people you\\'ll ever meet and she definitely knows how to make you feel at home. She was unavailable during our check-in time, so she left detailed notes for us when we got there so there was no confusion. Her home is beautiful and the bedroom was very cute and clean. The bed is also very comfortable! She provides clean towels, toiletries, extra blankets, and just about anything else you might need. She also put a label maker to great use to clarify any confusion with switches, door knobs, or faucets. She encourages guests to take advantage of whatever they may need, including the kitchen and living room. She also helped us with directions around the city and told us we could call and ask for help at any time. I can\\'t imagine that you could find any host more accommodating than Marcia. Overall, our experience was fantastic and I would love to go back to Seattle just to stay here! Once again, a fantastic home to relax in.  Marcia is an amazing woman who welcomed myself and my husband Leo.  I believe this is my third or fourth stay with Marcia and really is like going home.  For what ever reason I need to be in Seattle staying with Marcia is the icing on the cake.  Highly recommend.  We only spent one night at Marcia\\'s place but it was an overall good experience.Even if Marcia wasn\\'t able to welcome us,she had left us the keys and all the instructions to feel comfortable in her (website hidden) feels like a BnB with a lot of things labeled, a cupboard and shelves in the fridge dedicated to guests and a closet full of brochures and maps to get around (email hidden)e house is quite old and I\\'ve been sometimes bothered,being allergic to dust.The house is in a really nice and residential neighborhood,a 10 to 20-minute walk from Market St and Ballard Avenue where you can find a lot of trendy shops and restaurants.Going downtown via public transportation is a little bit trickier and often requires transfer (it can easily take 45 minutes,if not an hour).We only met Marcia for a quick chat and she seemed like a very sweet and open-minded person. I never got to meet Marcia, but she leaves her guests such wonderful and clear instructions that I didn\\'t feel I was getting the short end of the stick. Everything is labeled and explained thoroughly and she makes herself very accessible to reach out to, which was definitely appreciated! Her home is quaint and charming, and Ballard is a wonderful neighborhood to live in, if only even for a few days\\' vacation. I loved Marcia\\'s space and wished I could have stayed longer. Great neighborhood. Marcia was very flexible. I had a lovely stay in Seattle at Marcia\\'s home in Sunset Hill, Seattle. Everything was comfortable and clean.  Marcia is gracious and helpful.  The neighborhood is great, and it is easy to get there on public transportation from the airport.  I would definitely stay there again. Being with Marcia felt like coming home. She exudes warmth and kindness and what a better place the world would be with more people like Marcia in it. Just thinking about her puts a smile on our faces. Her house and garden reflect the person she is: creative, comforting, welcoming. We had a great time sharing stories and laughter. Her house is in a quiet residential area with great walking opportunities. She was extremely helpful explaining the bus system and suggesting funky places to visit. We hope somehow, somewhere we\\'ll see Marcia again. Truly a very special person with a heart that will always have room for yet another human being. Thank you Marcia for being you. My stay in Ballard was really special due to my circumstances. And I have to also say that choosing to stay at Marcia\\'s house was truly a great decision. She really goes above and beyond to make sure you have what you need to enjoy your stay at her home while visiting Seattle. Her home is so centrally located to restaurants, shops, the ocean. It\\'s lovely and walking around the neighborhood is truly lovely. Coming from Texas I was in amazement how Seattle has its own arboretum. LOVELY and Marcia is so sweet. We really enjoyed the time we spent with her.  Had a fabulous stay with Marcia! I am moving back to Seattle this summer and her home and her great company are perfect for me while I get through this transition. I have already booked my return visit while I wait for my Van Lines truck to arrive at my new place.  Beautiful home, easy-going host. We came to Seattle for a friend\\'s wedding, and Marcia was helpful and welcoming even as we were in and out at all hours. A+ My stay with Marcia was wonderful.  She made me feel right at home, the room/house is comfortable and clean, and the neighborhood is fun for walking, with nearby views and great food.\\r\\nMarcia has lots of information available about the neighborhood and Seattle in general available in pamphlets, a nice touch. I hope to get back when next I am in Seattle!\\r\\n Marcia was wonderful!  Our bedroom was very clean and the tourist info pamphlets she had prepared were extremely helpful.  Thanks Marcia, will definitely come back again. My wife and I were very happy to stay at Marcia\\'s large house in a quiet and charming section of Ballard overlooking the Sound. Marcia is completely organized for AirBnB customers with small notices posted in the large kitchen indicating storage areas, etc for us. We had an upstairs bedroom with large walk-in closet and comfortable bed, plus excellent and clean bathroom to ourselves.  And did I mention the house was large!  While we were staying in her house Marcia was on night shift so for much of our stay we actually had the house to ourselves, although we did manage to have some short conversations with our host who is very friendly and accommodating.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor people who are concerned, there is ample street parking in the neighborhood, and the house is within walking distance of public transport and a little bit more of a walk from a number of restaurants. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn short we had an extremely pleasant and relaxing stay at this AirBnB. Highly recommended. Marcia is a delightful, thoughtful host. She stayed in touch with us and made sure we had easy access to her home when we arrived at an unspecified hour in the late afternoon. Marcia was out visiting her family in Ballard when we arrived but we had clear instructions that enabled us to find our comfortable bedroom and get refreshing showers. We departed again before Marcia returned so we met her for the first time when we got back around 10 pm.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarcia\\'s charming older home is located at the top of Sunset Hill with a rain-friendly flower garden graced with garden art and a views of the bay. We had a comfortable bed and restful night in a quiet setting. We had instructions and everything we needed to make our own coffee and tea in the morning in a well appointed kitchen. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe definitely hope to return to Marcia\\'s AirBnB when we again visit Ballard to see our daughter. We enjoyed chatting with Marcia and shared our common garden interests and ideas for good food sources in the Seattle area.\\r\\n\\r\\nJudy Davis and Jack Kysar Marcia is a gem. This was our first Airbnb stay, and we LOVED it, mostly thanks to Marcia. She\\'s unflaggingly friendly and hospitable -- I felt as though I\\'d known her for years! She\\'s generous in a way that many people aren\\'t, inviting us to pick her raspberries, making us sun tea, driving us to the bus station when we missed the bus. I\\'m sending everyone I know to Ballard to stay with her. Her home is gorgeous and the bedroom comfortable. Plus, the area is charming, good public transportation makes getting around a breeze, and the restaurants in downtown Ballard are to die for. Bottom line: we love Marcia! Stay with her! This was my second time staying with Marcia, this time for a week, and once again she was a wonderful host, and her house was the perfect place to stay and rest after many long, busy days out. Marcia is the most kind, accommodating host you could ever have, and will make sure you have everything you need and has lots of helpful advice about Seattle. This time I had a chance to relax in her rocking bench in her beautiful and peaceful garden, and it was the best way to unwind after getting back home. Marcia is great. We had a friendly visit in the morning. The bed was very comfortable. Classic craftsman house. Clean, well kept, a blend of history, art pieces and at least one sewing machine. Quiet neighborhood close to Shilshole Marina, the  Ballard Locks and Rays Boathouse where there\\'s a dynamite happy hour. Marcia is warm and engaging. She was helpful and flexible. The house is in a wonderfully quiet neighborhood with views of the water. A great place to stay. I would definitely return! Had a very comfortable week in Marcia\\'s home. She was very attentive, warm and friendly and most of the time we had the entire house to ourselves. The location was perfect for us and i was able to meet up with my daughter, a friend, and later that week my husband and son joined me. It was a quiet neighborhood and i really enjoyed the mile walk down to Golden gardens. The use of the kitchen allowed us to eat breakfast in. We will be staying here again i hope when we are in Seattle again.   Marcia was an AMAZING host. Her house is absolutely beautiful, clean, and close to all the fun places to go in Seattle. My husband and I felt very comfortable, and Marcia gave us our space but was always available if we needed something. My only regret was not being able to stay longer than 2 days and get to know her better! Although I never got to meet Marcia, I would say she is an amazing host! Her warmth and hospitality is evident throughout her warm and welcoming home.  Marcia has a lovely house in a great neighborhood. I really enjoyed my stay there. Marcia is very flexible, and accommodates whatever you need to do, from leaving you alone to do your thing, to helping in any way with whatever problems you have. I highly recommend her and her house. Marcia\\'s home was lovely and inviting, and my sister and I enjoyed our stay! Even though we unfortunately barely saw Marcia, her warm presence was felt through little personalized touches that made us feel welcome. The neighborhood was beautiful, and getting to downtown Seattle was easy both by car and bus (we did both). Also, there is a very organized and thorough display of brochures including transit schedules. I highly recommend staying at Marcia\\'s-- I would again! Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t meet Marcia because of my schedule, but I can say surely she is an awesome host! The room was so clean and nice, and I could see that she took great care of the room for people who stay there. She was very nice and kind giving me information which I needed, and she cared about not only the room but also my time and experience during my stay there. I strongly recommend this wonderful room and host.  This place is a wonderful!!  The host is warm and kind and helped whenever she could. Her home is a beautiful Victorian house and our room was perfect.  Thank you Marcia -  You made our Seattle trip.  If you are going to stay in Seattle, I definitely recommend this place.  - Mooky. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your stay made our trip more memorable\" - Deirdre  Marcia has been a wonderful host and made us feel at home right from the beginning! She has been most welcoming and her quaint home in quiet and lovely Ballard  is a wonderful starting point for visiting Seattle. She has provided us with loads of information about this place and has been very helpful in every way.\\r\\nWe can absolutely recommend Marcia as an airbnb host, she\\'s open-minded, interesting, fun to be with. Marcia is truly an amazing host! She made our stay very enjoying and fun and we did love time that we have spent talking to her. Our son, Ezra, was very happy to be around Marcia as well, so overall we simply couldn\\'t have a better start to our West Coast trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is located at the beautiful Ballard district and is 10 min walk to the water and a pier where you would have an amazing view at the sunset. Take a 10 min drive the other way to Ballard Ave and you will find lots of awesome restaurants, coffee shops and cute little stores. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe would definitely want to be back to stay at Marcia\\'s place again sometime in future or to just come over to pay her a visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for the wonderful stay, Marcia! This was a great location for everything we were attending for a wedding in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. Taxis were quick and reasonable, plus we were easy to find when friends had the time to pick us up. We were \\'at home\\' so little, but Marcia had everything nicely organized and set-up so there was no getting lost or being uncertain about anything. Our first experience with airbnb was quite positive. Will definitely use again...and stay with Marcia again in Seattle if the circumstances arise! We didn’t get to me our host unfortunately, but the instructions were great to get into her home. The room we had was very nice and comfortable. The living room area was wonderfully decorated and even had a puzzle for my 5 year old granddaughter.  Nice quiet neighborhood.  Thanks!\\r\\n This is a lovely older home with lots of character and beautiful wood floors.  It is near Puget Sound and the neighborhood is quiet.  It was wonderful to have access to the kitchen and entire main floor.  The bed was comfortable.  Thank you, Marcia. Such a lovely stay !\\nVery clean and cute house, with everything you need.\\nMarcia is very welcoming and will do everything to help you. Thanks again for all the chats !\\nÀ bientôt ! :) Marcia\\'s house has a great atmosphere and she is a great host! the room is very lovely and the bed so comfortable. there was nothing we\\'ve missed. BTW: Ballard ist a wonderful place you should not miss! Great host! Great location! This cute Ballard home is in a very quiet residential area and yet close to all amenities and bus stops. The best thing we liked about it: it is within walking distance of Cafe Besalu, where you\\'ll find the best pastries outside Europe (definitely worth a try....and the long queues outside).\\r\\nWe highly recommend Marcia\\'s place, and doubly so for its proximity to Cafe Besalu :)   Marcia\\'s home is located a view miles away from downtown in a really nice neighborhood . The view is stunning... You can get within 20\\' by bus to Downtown Seattle. You should plan at least a view hours to visit Ballard with all the little nice shops and to dine out.  Marcia\\'s home was warm and inviting.  We felt very comfortable and hope to return.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharon and Joe Marcia is a great host, very friendly and helpful and the location is absolutely perfect!\\r\\nThe room was comfortable and nice.\\r\\nIf you come by car, it is easy to find a parking place in the street.\\r\\nHighly recommend :) What a special treat! Marcia\\'s home is extremely comfortable and beautiful. Her many little special touches make you feel right at home. We were fortunate enough to get to meet her in the morning of our brief overnight stay post wedding extravaganza. Just as sweet and kind as I expected after having had such lovely interactions setting up our stay. Thank you, Marcia!  Marcia was a very gracious host; she made us feel like we were her special guests!  Her house is located in a quiet neighborhood with very little traffic, near Puget Sound and Ballard main street.  The room was very clean and spacious, and the shared bathroom was a very easy situation (due to our host).  Marcia was very accommodating to our needs (especially to my wife, who has chemical sensitivities; clean house but no chemicals!). Marsha was a wonderful host, helpful in any way she could, warm, friendly and just a wonderful person. I am so glad to have stayed with her for the first half of my visit. She, her daughter & boyfriend were a big part in making me feel invited, comfortable and my having such a great time! Thanks so much Marsha!  We enjoyed our stay at Marcia\\'s home. She was very welcoming and had a great sense of humor. The room was clean and comfortable and the neighborhood was beautiful. We would highly recommend staying there. Marcia was very sweet and welcoming even though we didn\\'t meet her in person. I would definitely recommend her as a host and her room as a fantastic place to stay in Seattle!  We stayed at Marcia\\'s for a couple of nights and the experience was exemplary. The instructions for getting in were clear, the room was delightful and clean and the house itself located in a quiet neighbourhood with easy access to the tasty restaurants in Ballard as well as the D-line to downtown Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI couldn\\'t fault our stay and would recommend, whole-heartedly, that you stay with Marcia.  Marcia keeps a lovely home and it was a pleasure to stay there! Although Marcia was out of town and I didn\\'t actually get to meet her, she made us feel so comfortable and welcome. We enjoyed full use of the kitchen and felt right at home. Everything was clean, organized, and easy to find. I would definitely recommend staying here! My stay with Marcia was as delightful the second time as the first. I love the Ballard neighborhood and the comfy room.   We were greeted by a very pleasant and witty Marcia in a bathrobe apon arrival.  She had left us a nice trial of notes and keys to get ourselves into her place.  She then continued to welcome us into her beautiful home, with every little detail taken care of.  A perfect AIRBNB host.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarcia also drew us a hand map full of great recommendations for food.  Her map could challenge siri in a duel and win - and she drew it in a blink of an eye! \\r\\n\\r\\nMost of all, we loved her wit. Few people can match the wit of my BF and in a bathrobe no doubt :)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was plenty of parking available on the street.  The bed was super comfy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall a very pleasant experience.  Thanks Marcia!  We made a last-minute reservation and it turned out to be the perfect spot!  The house is in a quiet neighborhood, close to bus lines, and in easy walking distance to the downtown district of Ballard.  I\\'ve already made another reservation for my next visit to the area. This was my second stay with Marcia; the house is quiet and comfy, in a great walking neighborhood. Marcia is very helpful: she lent me her scissors and gave me pipe cleaners to finish the Halloween piggy costume for my granddaughter! I will return next trip! An incredible host in a beautiful city :) I have a lot of airbnb experience, and certainly Marcia is one of the best hosts I\\'ve ever stayed with. Highly recommend staying in this beautiful home!  Marcia\\'s location was just perfect- bus stop at the corner and several good connections for visiting the city by public transportation. Ballard is its own neighborhood with plenty of walking opportunity, A weekly sunday market, even ballroom dancing down the street! 24 hour grocery store in walking distance.\\r\\nMarcia was a perfect hostess. She offered valuable tourist ideas. She also encouraged us to use the house as our own- we enjoyed using the kitchen and sitting in the dining room to read. she has a terrific garden so we were disappointed that it was too wet/cold for us to take advantage of it during our trip. Marcia had a busy work schedule so we did not see much of her. Despite that, she found time to help me mend a personal item as she is very skilled with a sowing machine- thank you Marcia! We highly recommend Marcia .\\r\\n\\r\\n Host was personable, very helpful and clear in house instructions; thoughtful and considerate. Handsome home in great location with clean comfortable room/bath. Highly recommend. This is one of the best deals in the city of Seattle I wonder if I should leave a positive review because I\\'m afraid everybody will end up staying here but I will anyway it\\'s at the very most lovely neighborhood a gracious host a great place to stay This is a great deal for Seattle, especially if the Ballard area is right for your stay.  A gracious host in a lovely home.  What more could you ask for? Marcia\\'s home is completely comfortable and inviting, easy walking distance from all the best of Ballard (I recommend Pestle Rock Thai Restaurant - very fresh, creative yet authentic & delicious).  Marcia is lovely - I\\'m going back! Had a wonderful visit. It\\'s a cozy room, Marcia is sweet, and the neighborhood was so much fun to explore!  Staying with Marcia was warm, cheerful, lovely, welcoming and delightful experience. Marcia is a most friendly person, even though she was not feeling well and were working a lot during our stay, she always had a big smile and nice words to us. Already before our stay she sent me good information about Seattle and search the right bus routes. We were just happy to meet her and enjoy her positive and good humor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room is nice, clean and tide. There is lot of light in the room and space as well. We could use kitchen when we wanted and be in the house like we are in ours. After long trip you really appreciate that! The neighborhood is beautiful and peaceful and the bus to the city leaves right front of the house. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you Marcia, we definite recommend this sweet room in Sunset Hill! I loved staying at Marcia\\'s house - the room was really nice, comfortable, and quiet, it was a short walk to all the cute restaurants and shops in Ballard, and Marcia was a really nice person! I would definitely stay again. Great experience. Comfortable room with a nice view of the Ballard neighborhood. Quiet neighborhood with a 10 minute walk to all the best bars/restaurants in Ballard. A little far from the Capital Hill/Downtown area, the bus kind of takes forever, but a car share service like Car2Go makes it real easy. Marcia is super nice. Clean room, nice bathroom, nice kitchen available. I would definitely stay here again.  I thoroughly enjoyed my 1st experience with Airbnb and with Marcia at Craftsman in Sunset Hill, Ballard. Altho i did not see Marcia for a few days, her notes were totally welcoming and when i did meet her, she was very pleasant and open. My room was spacious, quiet, clean , convenient for the conference I was attending in Seattle. I felt very comfortable in her home. Marcia is the perfect host! She respects her guests\\' privacy, is very thoughtful and always a pleasure to be around. She even mended a button on my jacket for me, which I really appreciated. The house is very cozy and only minutes away from some very good eats & coffee shops, not to mention the Locks!  Thanks for everything, Marcia!  I had a great stay.  Sorry I missed you, but enjoyed the visit with Raleige.  She was very accommodating.  I hope to stay with you again this fall on my next trip to Ballard. We stayed with Marcia for 10 days, it was a very comfortable stay, very convenient for downtown Seattle, Marcia was a good host, we did not see too much of her, as she worked, and we were busy exploring Seattle, but it worked very well. I would recommend Marcia\\'s place, good stay. My friend was in town and I didn\\'t have room for her, so I set her up nearby at Marcia\\'s. Marcia was super responsive prior to the reservation in answering questions. The house was big, and there were cute signs leading up to the clean, neat room. Very beautiful house with artsy decorations. Marcia had left very clear information regarding the amenities, and my friend slept great! The internet was nice and strong for her to do work easily. We never got to meet Marcia unfortunately, but the opportunity worked out great! We stayed at Marcia\\'s for a week and a half while visiting Seattle. The room and house were exactly as described and soooo comfy! Marcia was great about communicating details and suggestions to us during our stay, and everything went smoothly. The house is in a great neighborhood with easy bus access to downtown and a quick walk into the historic district of Ballard. To save some money on our trip, we bought groceries and cooked at home for several of our meals, which was also a breeze and such a nice amenity to have! We would definitely recommend staying here to anyone coming to Seattle, and hope we will be able to come back soon. Marcia, I\\'m only sorry we didn\\'t get to see more of each other during our stay! Marcia lives in a lovely neighborhood very close to Discovery Park and lighthouse, which was on our must-do list and one of the reasons we choose her area. She was a very gracious hostess and even invited us to join their dinner party the first night we were there! Bed was comfy, everything was great! Marcia\\'s home was the most welcome and wonderful place to stay. She even put up an extra cot for us and made the bed. I would certainly return and stay there again.  This is a great house in a great neighborhood. Plenty of street parking, super comfy bed, and nice and quiet. Marcia sent an email a couple of days before our stay with all the information we needed for our stay, and she has plenty of pamphlets and flyers for area attractions. \\r\\n\\r\\nEasy walk to restaurants, and the area was nice for just walking around with no destination in mind. We only stayed one night, but this place would make a great \"home base\" for a longer stay in the Seattle Area.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinitely recommended! Marcia was so gracious and her darling room and home were just right! Our travel plans were chaotic, as we were planning and orchestrating a tea party and juggling a few too many moving parts. She was flexible, understanding and speedy with communication; her house was cheery and the room was welcoming, clean and peaceful; the neighborhood, view and nearby landmarks will make you want to move to Seattle (made me want to move back!). I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants an authentic and joyous Seattle experience.  Beautiful home. Marcia is awesome. Definitely would stay here again. Really close to the Locks and some nice fish and chip places. Comfortable bed. Nice bathroom. Overall a very inviting vibe. Would definitely recommend.  My sister and I had a wonderful stay at Marcia\\'s sweet craftsman home, which was cheery, clean and inviting. We slept like babies and woke up to the sound of songbirds. It was hard to leave such a great spot but as we left we had a stunning view of the Olympics from the front yard. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe were juggling a lot of moving parts during our trip and Marcia\\'s patience, kindness and hospitality made our time in Seattle joyful, comfortable and memorable. Staying in this beautiful part of Ballard will make you want to move (back, in our case!) to Seattle. We hope to stay with Marcia next time we\\'re in town. Marcia was helpful and responded quickly to my questions.Her home is lovely and my upstairs room felt private and was very quiet.There is a bathroom close by my room which was convenient. I had a great nights sleep in the comfy bed.The house is in a nice neighborhood with restaurants and parks within easy walking distance.I was very happy with this choice and hope to return next time I am in Seattle. Marcia is just a lovely host who gave us very detailed directions to find her house. The room is very clean and is located in a very quiet neighborhood, also walking distance to Ballard, our favorite area in Seattle (lots of nice cafés and restaurants). Thanks a lot Marcia. We had a great stay with Marcia.  She made us feel welcomed immediate by offering us something to drink and eat (she just had a party that night) and showed us our room.  We also met her friend Walter and had a lovely conversation getting to know each other before retiring for the night.  The bed was nice and firm which is great for us (with bad backs). The area is safe and quiet and parking very accessible outside.  If you get the chance to stay here we highly recommend you to visit the Ballard farmer\\'s market. It\\'s not to be missed.  We would definitely stay with Marcia in the future.   A great place to stay! Marcia is an excellent host, we feel we\\'ve made a new friend. It was like being at home - but better.  We\\'re talking up her place and AirBnB among friends.\\r\\n  This was our first experience with AirBnB and my first visit to my hometown in over ten years and a chance to show it to my partner. Has it ever changed. We had a great time, but wish the Seattle roads weren\\'t so pot-holey. Perhaps it was the Spring weather or the political climate, but it also seemed to me many Seattleites were more rude and depressed these days. Thankfully we had Marcia\\'s place to hang-out in. \\r\\n  I had a wonderful stay over at Marcia\\'s place.  My first arrival was welcomed with a personal board with my name and a welcome note.  Pleasantly surprise.  Lovely craftsman house in a great neighborhood and minutes drive to the heart of Ballard. Marcia has a very lovely house in a nice and quiet neighborhood in Ballard. The room is very cozy and only a 15 minute walk from the heart of Ballard.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\\'t get to meet Marcia as she was out of town during my stay, but everything was setup for me when I arrived and her daughter stopped by to check in on things. Exactly what I needed!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Marcia! A series of firsts: first Airbnb, first trip to Seattle etc. so we did not know what to expect! Happy to find a comfortable bed at the end of a very long trip from Belgium. We never met Marcia, she was out of town, but we had a very enjoyable stay at her lovely home in Ballard. We followed the instructions left by Marcia, got a little help from her daughter Raleigh who lives in a self contained apartment in Marcia\\'s home, and otherwise made ourselves at home. Thanks!\\n This was my first experience with airbnb and it was definitely exceeded expectations.. The location was great for us.  The Sunset Hills neighborhood is a nice area to go for a walk and getting to the main shopping and dining area in Ballard took only about 15 minutes on foot.  \\r\\nThe bed was very comfortable and the bedding was top quality.  I really like the well organized information about things to do in the immediate and wider area.  The first few days we were there was hot and it was nice to have a fan available in the spacious closet.\\r\\nEach day we started with the coffee that was available to brew in the kitchen.\\r\\nHost Marcia was away during our visit, so her daughter, Raleigh stepped in and was friendly and helpful.\\r\\nI hope if we visit Ballard in the future we will be able to stay with Marcia again.\\r\\n Host and I never had opportunity to actually meet; she was returning from a trip,\\r\\nand was generous enough to permit me to stay in her lovely space. Marcia was the perfect host. The room was ready, bathroom clean and key in the location promised. Her house is an easy walk to many attractions in Ballard including the Government Locks and Dicovery Park. We appreciated the pancakes for breakfast and friendly conversation with ideas for our day. It is a locations that we will use again. Marcia\\'s home is located within walking distance of the heart of Ballard - restaurants, breweries, and more. Her home was clean and exceeded expectations. The bed was very comfortable. We slept well! Marcia was prompt in her communications.  Very comfortable bed,  quiet neighborhood, would stay again!  Marcia makes this accommodation special because of her warm, open hospitality. Ballard is a beautiful part of Seattle with its access to parks and the ocean.  The accommodation is away from nightlife or hustle and bustle which is exactly what I like.  It was quiet and comfortable. I loved my stay at Marcia\\' s. The location is perfect in a quiet, beautiful neighborhood close to downtown Ballard. My room had everything I needed, and the bed was really comfy and cozy. I have a back issue, so that was important to me. The shared bathroom was spotless clean. In the kitchen there was airbnb space for my food, and everything was labeled and easy to find. Coffee was provided and the best I\\'ve tasted!!! I did not connect with Marcia while I was there as she works at the hospital. But she communicated how I could get in touch with her if needed. I would love to return when I am back in Seattle. Marcia knows how to put a guest at ease to make you feel at home. I was able to use the kitchen to prepare dishes that also allowed me to save money. She respected my personal space while being available for advices, informations and practical help. For me, Marcia is a very benevolent person. \\r\\nDuring my stay, some renovations took place in the house, causing dust and sometimes noises (not a big deal) but Marcia was accomondante. She was very warm and inviting. Made us feel right at home. The room was comfortable and we felt at ease using the kitchen and living room downstairs. Would stay there again. Great deal in Seattle! Our host was friendly and provided helpful info for our local travels. The room and bathroom were clean and included everything we needed. Convenient location to downtown Seattle and excellent mountain views from the street. Highly recommended! Great location. Close to Crittenden (Ballard) Locks. Since I had a rental car Pike\\'s Market and the Space Needle were easily accessible. Quiet residential neighborhood.  Picolino\\'s, a fantastic Italian restaurant, is within easy walking distance. Room is on the 2d floor with shared bath just across the hall. Due to owner\\'s work schedule we met only once as I was checking out. A vertical fan in the room really helped to keep the air flowing. I stayed at Marcia\\'s place for one night. The neighborhood is very safe and quiet and the room was very clean. I didn\\'t have too many conversations with Marcia but she was very polite when asking me if I could leave the room by 10am so that she could clean the room before she left. Overall, I would recommend Marcia\\'s place to someone who is looking for good price to stay at a good place.  Great experience for my son and I. Marcia\\'s place is located very close to Ballard Locks, Shilshoe Marina and Rays,half block to public transportation.We really enjoyed time with Marcia, she is so nice that she made us feel at home and very relaxed. We appreciated all the help Marcia offered to us, we have been stayed in Marcia\\'s for 1 month and will sure be back again. Had a wonderful experience @ this airbnb! Marcia was easy to communicate with and very accommodating! I will surely stay again! We never actually met Marcia but she made it very easy to access her home and everything was as advertised. She has a great selection of helpful tourist type materials available in the room if you need some ideas. The area is very handy to the Ballard docks and the vibrant Ballard community. Marcia made us feel so welcome in her home! She was communicative, friendly, and warm, while maintaining a high degree of professionalism. The room was beautiful and clean, and the house\\'s location was very convenient for our Seattle explorations.  Marcia provided a comfortable, clean, restful accommodation, with clear and organized information. My mother and I felt as if we had been welcomed into a friend\\'s home during our brief stay. Nice welcome to the Ballard section of Seattle.  A very comfortable room and lovely home in a great neighborhood.  Marcia was a great host and very helpful with directions and recommendations around town. A clean and tidy home - walking distance to one of the most interesting parts of Seattle - nightlife, shopping and watersports.  Marcia was very professional and made me feel welcome.\\n Marcia\\'s room is in an excellent location for someone visiting without a vehicle.  It\\'s close to bus stops and is within walking distance of the Chittenden Locks, restaurants and shopping.  The room was very comfortable and although I never actually met Marcia, she made me feel at home.  The bed was super comfortable and the house was quiet.  I slept like a baby.  I\\'ll be back. Marcia is an excellent host. She is really knowledgable about the city and really helped us out. She takes an interest in her guests and genuinely cares about their needs and them as a person. My husband and I moved here from Ohio and needed a place to stay while we looked for apartments and jobs. Marcia let us do laundry, store food in her fridge, and offered us help on great things to see and do. I would absolutely recommend staying with her to anyone. She is really awesome.  Great neighborhood, walkable to the restaurants in Ballard and close to the water. Marica was great about leaving me instructions on how to get in if she wasn\\'t there and insuring that I received the instructions.  In the end, they weren\\'t needed as she arrived just about the same time as I did.  Marcia did a great job of accomodating our needs in her home.  She sent us a detailed message about where to find the key at the house.  She was there when we got there, and introduced us to the facilities, and made sure we had enough blankets.  \\r\\nShe is a warm and welcoming host, and the information she had printed up for guests made sure we knew how to use the shower and the wifi.\\r\\nMarcia\\'s home is in Balllard, and we loved exploring the shopping close by, and even made it to the Nordic Heritage Museum, a real treat.  \\r\\nAnyone who stays with Marcia will enjoy the area, and a pleasant place from which to explore Seattle. Very calm neighborhood, the room was big and clean. Very comfortable bed, wifi worked well. Great kitchen!  Marcia was a lovely host. Her home was very clean and welcoming and we felt like we were at home. Marcia did whatever she could to enhance our stay in Seattle. Marica makes a loveky cream pie and she was very kind to give us some. We loved our stay in Seattle and we hope to return again! We only stayed one night in Craftsman Home, but we really enjoyed our stay there. It is a lovely house and Marcia is a very nice and kind host. We hope to come back another time and stay longer :) Marcia is a very warm and lovely host! Sadly we only had the chance to talk to her in the morning, but she gave us helpful information about free visiting spots in Seattle. The room and the bathroom were very nice and clean, and the kitchen had everything we needed. We would stay again!! Marcia made me feel at home from the start. She was very easy-going and I felt comfortable in her home. Marcia\\'s home was as described and I always felt completely safe in the neighbourhood. I would recommend the local Lockspot Cafe for good food and beer.\\r\\nThank you Marcia. Our needs of a good overnight stay with just a comfortable bed in a quiet neighborhood without frills or fuss where completely met.  Although we did not meet Marcia in person because of Marcia\\'s work schedule, she left us with detailed information on gaining entry to her house. We really enjoyed our stay at Marcia\\'s lovely Ballard home in Seattle. We were warmly welcomed and felt very comfortable during our stay. The neighborhood was picturesque and was a nice retreat from the bustle of the city. Enthusiastically recommend!  This was a nice, quiet room in a residential neighborhood not too far from a bunch of restaurants, etc. The bed, room, and bathroom were all quite clean, and the hostess and her family were friendly and helpful.   Beautiful and clean chararctre home in a great Seattle neighborhood.\\r\\nWe had a nice stay at Marcia\\'s home.  She provides everything we needed and beyond, very well organized and clear. Our stay was very short, as planned, so we didn\\'t even cross paths. \\r\\nWe would stay again gladly. This was a lovely first experience for me using airbnb. I\\'ve gotta repeat what many other reviewers have already said -- Marcia was so warm and welcoming, instantly put me at ease.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is gorgeous, has great bones, a treat to get a glimpse of. The neighborhood is so pretty and sedate, with historic houses in every direction -- residential but then too a very short enjoyable walk to old town Ballard with its many restaurants. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis upstairs room is well situated, just across the hall from the bathroom, facing the quiet street, with big windows that give you fresh air for a great sleep. The bed is super comfortable and the linens soft and fresh. Colors are tasteful and soothing, just overall a lovely space.  Overall I had a fantastic experience, and will certainly be a repeat guest with Marcia. Marcia described the accommodations perfectly.  The home is a lovely old craftsman.  The room was very comfortable with a nice bathroom down the hall.  Marcia had left instructions, but she was at home.  Very gracious.  Sunset Hill is a very nice neighborhood in Ballard.  Residential, parking was easy.  I highly recommend Marcia\\'s airbnb and hope to stay there again. Perfectly organised, lovely house and a nice neighbourhood. I had a great time in Seattle and one reason for this was staying in the great AirBnB room of Marcia. Everything was really comford and clean. To stay in Marcia´s wondefull hause is like having an little own private apartmend with an  own bathroom. I can just suggest to everybody who is looking for a calm and nice host to go to Marcia in Ballert. The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting. This is the perfect place! 15min to downtown Seattle and in a cute, comfortable neighborhood. Marcia makes sure you have everything you need to be comfortable & have an easy stay. We are definitely coming back next time we need a place in Seattle.  This was my first Airbnb experience. \\n\\nWay before I arrived Marcia was good about emailing me with details and asking if I needed information on anything like transportation, etc.   She was good with providing me with details on letting myself in since she would not be home.  When I met Marcia she made me feel at ease. She was friendly and helpful in pointing out good places to eat. The room was clean and smelled fresh and clean. Her home and room is as pictured. \\n\\nI was there for two nights and pretty much gone every day until late at night. The price was just right for what I needed - a clean room with a comfortable bed and clean bathroom. \\n\\nI only saw Marcia that one day when I arrived and then it almost seemed like I had the house to myself.  I would definitely come back if I ever had to come thru Ballard which by the way, her home is very close to downtown Ballard.\\n\\nThank you, Marcia, for your hospitality and sharing me your home. \\n\\n Marcia made an extra effort to meet us even though her work schedule is demanding. We felt safe in her home and neighborhood. We loved being able to walk to Ballard for the self-guided walking historic tour (pamphlet provided by Marcia) and the Farmers\\' Market. Marcia\\'s place is great! She is a very friendly, energetic and accommodating host. The room is comfortable + clean and I felt very welcome! Marcia made me feel at home right away. She gave me a cupboard and space in the fridge for a little food I brought with me. I even had the pleasure of joining her and her family for dinner, which was delicious, and a nice surprise. The house is a beautiful Craftsman home with lots of nice sunlight. It is quiet, cozy, spacious and clean. The neighborhood is a pleasant 10 min. walk to several restaurants, coffee and tea shops. Marcia is a great hostess! Warm and friendly and easy to get along with. The room was everything we wanted it to be; clean, quite close to the vibrant NW market street and within walking distance to buses heading downtown. Would definitely recommend Marcias place! Marcia was very warm & welcoming. The room was spacious and comfortable in a very nice neighborhood of NW Seattle. I recommend it highly.  Marcia was a wonderful host and made me and my girlfriend feel welcome in her home. We didn\\'t see her when we first arrived, but she provided us the instructions on how things worked. We met her the next day and she was friendly and helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighbourhood is great - it\\'s a few minutes drive from the locks and Ballard\\'s main street, where the bars and restaurants are. You\\'ll need a car to get into downtown, but better yet, just stay in the neighbourhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was comfortable and cozy. The mattress was a little too soft for my liking - but I have a bad back.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would definitely stay in the area, and with Marcia, again. Marcia takes hosting guests seriously and it shows through the effort and care she puts into making the stay comfortable and her home welcoming. Had a great room and a comfy bed, can\\'t get better than that!  Marcia was very prompt and thorough in her communication- which was greatly appreciated. She has a lovely historic home in the very hip Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. She is close to restaurants and shops, and there was a bus stop just down the street. Her home is clean, comfortable, and very quiet. The heater in the bedroom is fantastic. \\r\\nI also really appreciated that she cleaned the bathroom every day I was there.  The wifi was fast. Two drawbacks- the bathroom was missing a doorknob and entry through the front door was difficult. Didn\\'t have too much interaction with her, but the little I had- she was lovely. Would stay here again. Thank you!  I stayed here with my mom for a night on our way back from Vancouver. Communication with Marcia was very easy: she responded promptly and sent detailed instructions ahead of time for our late-night arrival. A nice little list of helpful info about the house was on our bed, and the room was even labeled with a crafty sign. The stairs were fine, and you could sense the character of this historic home from the \"old house\" smell. The bed was comfortable enough for weary travelers, although a bit uneven/soft. There were plenty of blankets and clean towels as well as a stockpile of local maps in the closet. We only saw Marcia briefly in the morning, but that worked fine for us. Overall a cute old house in Ballard, only a couple blocks from the water in two directions (and the fish ladder at the locks) and a 10-minute walk to the cafes/boutiques of Market St. I was able to get to and from Marcia\\'s house from the airport.  I took the light rail to downtown where I caught an express bus to her house.  On leaving I took a city bus back to the light rail and then to the airport.   A few blocks to the fish locks and walking along the water.  A few blocks the other way for coffee and rolls every morning.  A comfortable bed and quiet room.  It worked out very well for me! Shawn and I stayed at Marcia\\'s house  a few days ago, and it was a cozy, comfortable experience. It had been snowing and we were freezing. When we got up to our room, it was soo warm and welcoming. We didn\\'t get to meet Marcia, but did meet her daughter who was welcoming, helpful, and sweet. We were thankful for the use of Marcia\\'s clean and extremely organized kitchen where we cooked a little dinner and breakfast. We had a quiet, nice stay. Thanks Marcia! This was my second stay at Marcia\\'s.  I felt very welcome.  She has a lovely home and my room was very comfortable.  The bed was heavenly!  Marcia\\'s home is in a lovely neighborhood.  I hope to stay there again. I\\'ve stayed with Marcia on more than a few occasions. Marcia and I have become friends and I am more than familiar with her house and her neighborhood. Ballard is a great place to be around Seattle! Marcia\\'s airbnb room is comfortable and roomie and a great value! Fabulous!  Marsha\\'s home is beautiful; she is fun and a gracious host.  The bedroom is spacious and the bed is very comfortable.  My son and daughter-in-law just moved to Seattle and I plan to make this my home away from home.   Room exactly as pictured and , even better, super warm and cozy.  The bed was comfortable (I brought my own pillow and ended up liking Marcia\\'s pillow better!)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is plenty of room to hang out if you want to spend a lazy afternoon in. Love the sunroom and the living room. We were welcome to use the kitchen which was a huge plus. The kitchen is well stocked , has coffee tee and all you will ever need.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarcia answered all my questions promptly and worked out key exchange in advance. Things were set up such that we would be able to enter the home even though Marcia was not there and I appreciate that.  There were notes left here and there that covers all bases (how and where to find what we need, etc.) Maps and guidebooks/pamphlets are in the room. The map of Ballard/sunset hill neighborhood was marked by Marcia so we know where her home is and where groceries stores are. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is cool, quiet , but also has plenty to keep you occupied. Plenty of amazing restaurants, microbreweries, bakeries and stores (and record shops if you are into that kind of stuff!). The waterfront is just a few blocks away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Marcia was a perfect host. We got back to her home fairly late and had to leave early, so we didn\\'t get to actually her. However, her notes and general communication were very welcoming and comforting. Her home was lovely and the room was great. One of the best night\\'s sleep my husband and I have had recently. Thank you greatly Marcia!  Ann & I enjoyed our brief stay at Marcia\\'s house -- she responded quickly to our request, the arrangements for our stay were well communicated, and we found the accommodations very much as described: cozy, comfortable, and in a great location.  Marcia herself was a gracious hostess and made us feel very welcome.    Marcia was very nice and friendly. She has patient to answer my question. The house was beautiful, the room was very clean, comfortable ( especially the bed, haha), and warm. My friend and I felt great at seattle.  I hope to stay there again. Thank you Marcia Nice place. Close to downtown. The room was clean and we had no problem. Marcia is the perfect host. She made us feel wonderfully welcome and provided a wealth of information on not only Ballard but also Seattle as a city. The room is just adorable and the bed great. Location is fantastic just a short walk to the Crittenden Locks and easy walk to public transport. I really enjoyed staying at the house. It was very quiet and in a nice neighborhood. Very clean and organized and I loved the little personalized message on the white board when I checked in.  Marcia is always very welcoming and gave me a cup of hot tea with an offer of a snack when I arrived.  She carried my bag upstairs and was, as usual, helpful and friendly.  I enjoyed my stay with her.  The bedroom was cosy and warm, and I was made to feel at home.  I always feel so comfortable in Marcia\\'s home, that it is beginning to feel a bit like home when I return. Though I did not get to meet Marcia, my boyfriend did, and said that she was very kind and friendly. The room we stayed in was clean and inviting--everything was just as described. It was a very pleasant experience and I would definitely stay there again if I had the need to. Highly recommended. Marcia was the perfect host. She let me know about the wonderful and fun neighborhood.  Marcia was an absolutely lovely host. I was in town for work and she was quite flexible about working with us, which we sincerely appreciated. The room was charming and we felt quite welcome. I would highly recommend if you\\'re staying in Ballard anytime soon. Our stay with Marcia was comfortable and easy. Her home is in a lovely neighborhood, and she made us feel very welcomed. We didn\\'t have the pleasure of meeting her in person, but she provided detailed instructions for us, and was kind enough to check in and make sure everything was going smoothly. We loved the bedroom which was quiet and peaceful. I haven\\'t slept so soundly in weeks! Thank you, Marcia, for your hospitality. We had a great stay and would highly recommend it! Everything was just as we had hoped.  The room was lovely, bigger than we had expected from the picture in a fantastic neighborhood.   We felt very at home.  Marcia was very welcoming -- as were her family members.  We\\'d definitely stay again.\\r\\nLisa What a lovely welcome, clean as a whistle, with a very special hostess! The listing was accurate, accommodation excellent. Neighborhood was blooming with spring flowers, safe, easy parking, secure and quiet.  More than happy to leave a review for a place which made my stay most memorable in Seattle. First of all, I\\'d love to thank Marcia for providing a cozy and clean room. I was so lucky to meet her and her family during my stay. She was a wonderful host, genuine and caring. (She even made me some strawberry shortcake that was super delicious:))\\n\\nExcellent location, safe neighbourhood, cozy room, but above all, what I loved most was her wonderful hospitality. \\n\\n Marcia\\'s place was a great spot to explore Seattle from. Ballard is a charming neighbourhood and there are lots of nice places to eat and drink. I\\'d recommend The Walrus and the Carpenter on Ballard Avenue which does great seafood. Even though our stay was short the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. We woke up early the next morning to a beautiful sunrise with Mt. Rainier in the distance. Lovely home, quiet neighborhood very close to Ballard Locks, restaurants and shops. We felt completely at home. marcia was a very welcoming host with whom the communication was easy and pleasant.  i very much felt at home in marcia\\'s house.  the private room itself was spacious and clean.  the bed was very comfortable.  the location is great.  the spectacular view of water and the olympic range in the neighborhood was mesmerizing every single time i drove toward it.  great value overall. We never met Marcia, but she made everything so easy via messages and written communication. The house is  charming and comfortable--although very warm! Definitely recommended. Ballard is a cute area.  Marcia was a wonderful host who cheerfully accommodated my unique schedule. The house was functional and in an interesting part of the city, the room was comfortable and clean, and the whole experience was great.  Marcia was a very warm and hospitable hostess! I would highly recommend her place to others. The room was clean and the bed very comfotrable. The house is very well located to everything in downtown ballard even though the house is located in a very quiet neighborhood.  We had an awesome time staying with Marcia. She made us feel welcome and didn\\'t hesitate to make sure we had everything we needed. She gave us great recommendations (Ray\\'s Cafe in Ballard is delicious) and the room was comfortable, clean, and had a great view. Public transportation is easily accessible from the house and Uber/Lyft are alternatives (FYI -- for some reason when putting in the address, it goes to the road on the back of the house, so we\\'d usually go to the corner). We had an amazing time in Seattle and would definitely recommend staying with Marcia ! Thanks so much for the great stay. Marcia was a gracious host. Very nice and informative. She make my trip to Seattle a pleasant one. Marcia provided the perfect place for me to rest and recover after an intense week and during the time I was taking a course in Ballard. \\n\\nI loved the comfy bed and level of freedom she allows to come and go.

The room and the bathroom are nice and clean and everything is well organized. We really enjoyed staying at her place and highly recommend it to everyone visiting the area.  My girlfriend and I stayed with Marcia for a couple of days and couldn\\'t have asked for a more welcoming host or more comfortable accommodations. Marcia\\'s home is lovely and the Ballard neighborhood is a great place to land during a visit to Seattle.  My girlfriend and I stayed for 2 nights on a weekend. I really liked the house, lots of space to find a place to sit, the room was nice, the bed was comfortable. I like how organized Marcia was with house rules, labelled drawers, brochures for local sights,etc. The house was in a nice neighborhood, easy to get to the water, parks and downtown. What a great place to stay! Marcia\\'s wonderful room was truly comfortable, a home away from home- quiet, relaxing and more spacious than we thought from the picture. It was also the perfect base to explore the really fascinating area of Ballard, with it\\'s incredible restaurants, bars and breweries. We met Marcia briefly and she proved to be truly an welcoming and thoughtful host. Highly recommended! Our week in Ballard was such a wonderful time! We felt welcomed and comfortable at once and loved the house and the neighborhood. Marcia was always helpful and funny, so we had no problems at all finding everything and enjoying our days. Sometimes we went home earlier to have a cup of tea and then go out again to watch the sunset. If we have the chance to come back to Seattle we would definitely try to stay with Marcia again.  Nice old house on a quiet, tree lined street, walking distance to great restaurants and the Locks.  Comfy, quiet room and an excellent, friendly host, Marcia.  Looking forward to coming back soon!  Marcia is a lovely person. Her welcoming personnality rubs off on her home. We recommend Marcia\\'s place anytime! The Ballard neighborhood, in which she resides, is the nicest place we\\'ve seen in Seattle. You are at walking distance from awesome restaurants, coffee shops, arts & crafts stores and bars. We did not get to stay long enough in Marcia\\'s lovely room in her wonderful neighborhood!  We had everything we needed and hope to come back for another visit in the future. Marcia was great! She welcomed me at the door, offered to help carry a heavy suitcase, and made me feel at home. The residential neighborhood was beautiful, with lush front gardens lining the street.

Marcia was very understanding and gave us a great recommendation for dinner and was sensitive about providing a quiet environment for both of us to get to sleep early. \\r\\n \\r\\nMarcia\\'s home is in a quiet, beautiful neighborhood. The location is ideal for a peaceful night sleep. The room was just as described with a very comfortable bed. It was delightful to wake up to lush green and flowers galore in this quaint Ballard neighborhood.  We had a great time at Marcia\\'s.  Her home was lovely, our room was large and comfortable, and in a great neighborhood.  She lives close to very nice places, Ballard is very convenient for us.  We will come again. Marcia\\'s wonderful house lived up to the warm reviews. She made us\\r\\nfeel welcome and comfortable. We loved visiting Seattle--\\r\\nwhat a wonderful city you have--and staying in a home added to our \"feel\" for the city. We enjoyed our conversations with Marcia and her family\\r\\nand highly recommend and rate our experience. We felt that if we lived in Seattle, we would like to include Marcia among our friends. It was a pleasure to stay in a historic Craftsman style home in a beautiful walking neighborhood! Marcia was warm and accommodating, helpful with any questions. I loved the large comfortable bedroom, with brochures for sights! It was an easy walk to bus to Seattle for sights. Dear Marcia,\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks so much for these both nice nights in your lovely room. Unfortunately, we haven\\'t seen to much of eachother but I\\'ll definetly come back to your place once I come back to Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the best,\\r\\nLeonie We never crossed paths with Marcia during our stay since we came in and went to bed before Marcia got back from work and left after Marcia left, but Marcia\\'s instructions were so concise and clear that our stay was very smooth and comfortable, regardless. Very comfortable room and amenities, and had a great sleep for the night. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who\\'s in the Seattle Area! A skip and a jump from places like Ballard Locks and the University area, which was all very convenient. Marcia had a unique and lovely house. She gave us directions to downtown via transit and was very welcoming. We will certainly stay again if we return to Seattle. We had a great time at Marcias home in Ballard. Marcia is a nice and welcoming host and the room was lovely and clean. The neighborhood is quiet and residential and only a short drive from hip Ballard Ave. with bars and restaurants. Don\\'t miss the Sunday\\'s farmers market. We would most definitely stay here again. Very organised airbnb so easy.  Marcia was great.  Helpful re buses into the city.  We enjoyed staying in a relaxed, quiet neighbourhood.  Convenient bus ride to city of Seattle.  Great kitchen and welcome use of space.  I would definitely stay at her place again.

She is also very helpful on planning your stay in this wonderful city.\\nThe place in Ballard is very cosy, nice, quite and well located since it is a short drive or even a walking distance to golden garden park and the lock.\\nWe strongly recommand this place. Our host Marica made us feel welcome to her lovely home by sending us emails and having a cute sign outside our bedroom welcoming us.  She was flexible as we stayed for two days and then left for two days returning then for another day at her home.  She let us keep hanging clothes and a suitcase in a closet while we were gone to have more room in our car.  Her location is fabulous as it is a short walk to restaraunts and even the water that looks out to the Olympic Peninsula.   Lovely vintage Ballard home!\\nWe loved staying with Marcia!  Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and given dinner suggestions. The room was very large and bed extremely comfortable!  We had a bathroom all to ourselves and were given instructions on how to operate the older fixtures. The home is just a few blocks from the Ballard Locks which we were surprised to discover. We had a bonus adventure there our first evening before dinner. I highly recommend staying here and would book it again when we are in Seattle! What a great experience! Our hostess was completely welcoming and very helpful. She provided us with good advice about enjoying our first visit to Seattle. She made us feel comfortable in her home immediately. The room was large and the bed was perfect. The location of the house was very convenient to all of the sights in Seattle, and especially so to the very interesting neighborhoods of Ballard and Fremont. We were within 30 minutes of everything we wanted to see (and we wanted to see everything). It was a very pleasant stay. The bed was very good and it was very quiet. Marcia\\'s place was great.  Very convenient in a nice, quiet residential neighborhood.  Her communication was great too.  We will definitely use Marcia\\'s place again. This was my very first airbnb experience and it was a 5/5 stars! Marcia\\'s home is beautiful and she is a fantastic host. She was very quick to respond to any questions I had and even though I only saw her once while I was there, she was the sweetest most welcoming person! She left little personalized notes for us and she also always left a few lights on at night so we would have no problems getting up to the room. The room is exactly as pictured and both the room and the bathroom were spotless when we arrived. That was a huge plus for me given that filth in general tends to give me anxiety. Ballard is quite a ways away from the airport and the downtown area, but it is a cute little part of town with tons of shops, cafes and restaurants. If you have a car, getting around Seattle won\\'t be an issue. We used the public transportation system and it worked for us. Buses seem to run pretty late and they were never jammed packed with people or anything. All this to say, we didn\\'t mind using the bus to get from Marcia\\'s home to any of the touristy places in downtown Seattle. If I go back to Seattle, I would totally stay with Marcia again, so I totally recommend! Thank you Marcia! This was our first Airbnb adventure so we weren\\'t sure what to expect.  However, we were made welcome as soon as we entered Marcia\\'s home and very much enjoyed our three night stay.  The room was clean and quiet, and the house was charming.  Meeting Marcia was like reconnecting with an \"old\" friend.  When we next visit our Ballard relatives, we will certainly plan to stay here again.   We had a wonderful stay at Marcia\\'s place! She gave great details of how to get to her house from the airport and we had no problem finding it. Her home is very clean, comfortable, and well set-up for airbnb guests. Though we never got to meet Marcia in person, she was very responsive to all messages and made sure we had everything we needed for a good trip to (email hidden)e even accommodated an extra guest in our room by providing a cot for her to sleep on. There are plenty of brochures, maps, and information booklets in the room about what to do and see in Seattle which we really appreciated! Thank you, Marcia! Nice host  Marcia is a great host.   Although she was not home when we arrived, she gave us detailed instructions as to how to get in, and, had left us a welcome note at the entry to our room.  The room was clean and the carpet was newly cleaned.  The house was clean and it was great to have our own bathroom.  Comfortable bed and clean sheets.  When we met her later, Marcia helped us plan our time more efficiently.  Her knowledge of the local area and the amount of time required to go to Mount Rainier was right on the dot.  Although we did not use them, she thoughtfully provides her guests with a slew of maps and brochures for local activities. Marcia was a welcoming and warm host.  She left very clear instructions about staying at her home and took time to make sure I was comfortable and had what I needed.  Her house is amazing and located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood in Ballard.  If you like older homes with a lot of charm, this is the place for you.  The room itself is spacious and very homey, with a great view!  When I come back to Seattle, I\\'d love to stay here again.  Thanks, Marcia! My host was the nicest and sweetest person ever. Always willing to help me with directions, which I always needed. We had a great visit to the Ballard area and staying with Marcia made the stay perfect. Warm and welcoming, Marcia house is charming and in a good location. Our accommodations were clean and It was easy to come and go. Nice visit!  Marcie is friendly and helpful. Great fun talking to her.\\xa0 She is also very accommodating.\\xa0 The room is spacious and clean.\\xa0 Nice neighborhood and quiet, near the Hiram m Chittenden locks.\\xa0 Would stay there again! Marcia is a wonderful host, she made us feel very welcome in her cozy home. It was too bad we had so little time to get to know each other (because of our tight schedule), but we definitely will come back here if we visit the city again. \\nTo Marcia: whenever you are in Belgium, contact us and we will be honored to have you as our guest. The host was very friendly and - caring. Lights were left on in the house for my arrival late at night.\\r\\nThe neighborhood is fascinating, lots to see and do. A daytime bus journey to Seattle.\\r\\nThe house which is a beautiful family home is spacious in a very American style.\\r\\nThe bedroom was very comfortable with plenty of lighting.The kitchen has all the conveniences plus coffee and tea and a beautiful deck out the back.Also, at the front a true American porch. There is a walk in closet off the bedroom.The bathroom is nearby with plenty of hot water and clean towels.\\r\\nThere are plenty of leaflets and maps for local attractions. It was a wonderful place to stay and I  would thoroughly recommend it. Marcia, the host, was wonderful, welcoming and always wanting to make sure I was comfortable and checking if I need anything. She was not there a lot so I had the house to myself most of the time. The house and neighborhood are very quiet and lovely. The listing was accurate. bed was comfortable with ample space and a nice bathroom. \\r\\nIn hot weather the room can be warm, though Marcia has a very nice fan in the room. There is a rug in the bedroom Marcia hosted my husband and me while we were visiting my niece in Seattle. This was our first time using Airbnb. Marcia was welcoming and made us feel at home immediately. We were busy all day and it was so nice to come back to a comfortable bed and the peace and quite of Marcia\\'s home. The neighborhood was perfect for us. We highly recommend Marcia as a host. Nice accommodations and well located. Marcia was easy to work with and provided everything needed to make my stay a good one. Thanks!! Marcia was a wonderful host.  We felt welcome from our first acceptance email, in our correspondence, when we arrived and all during our stay.  It was great.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, Marcia had some wonderful touches to the comfortable, clean, quiet accommodations.  For example, lots of brochures, bus schedules, magazines and guides were available.  In the beside table drawer was a flashlight, scissors and a little sewing kit.  And she also provided a welcome guide with guidelines for our stay,  an invitation to use the kitchen and many other details that made us feel at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood was very quiet and pretty.  As we expected from Marcia\\'s listing, it was about a 10-15 minute walk to downtown Ballard. \\r\\n\\r\\nMarcia also kindly allowed us to drop our luggage off a bit earlier than normal check in and also leave them later then normal check out which was very nice and much appreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would highly recommend Marcia as a host and her home as great, quiet, clean and comfortable accommodations.   Great neighborhood, easy to walk to lots of places.  Marcia made us feel welcome although we rarely saw her.  It felt like we had the house to ourselves.  Very comfortable. Five Star: *****!  Marcia\\'s home is spacious and fragrant.  She is not only gracious but also considerate, such as providing labels so that one need not search around for things.  We felt like honored guests, or even as cousins meeting for the first time.  We liked her friends.  Her neighborhood, Ballard, is also inviting.  Our experience could not have been better. Marcia is seriously the BEST hostess. She has a fantastic and roomy house, and the room was huge with a large walk-in closet, perfect for storing your belongings. She provided us with many amenities and allowed us access to her washer and dryer, along with the kitchen. The location is pretty close to downtown ballard, and walking distance from the locks. Although we didn\\'t see her a whole lot, she did keep excellent communication.  I highly recommend staying with her. She is such a pleasure. We had to extend our stay, and she was very accommodating. We were in Seattle for three nights visiting friends and relatives. Although we did not have much interaction with Marcia (due to conflicting schedules), instructions to her house and for accessing the room and facilities were perfect. Marcia\\'s house is warm and welcoming and the room is amply large, clean, and includes a private bathroom. This is one of the most comfortable beds we\\'ve ever slept in and combined with the super-quiet neighborhood, we had three peaceful and restful nights. Very convenient to all that the wonderful Ballard neighborhood has to offer (including some of Seattles best bakeries). We barely used our car as everything is walking distance. A fantastic experience. Highly recommended. The studio cottage was a cozy and nicely decorated. Doug and Lori were friendly and very pleasant. They cheerfully provided us with an iron and ironing board so we could get ready for a wedding. Helpful tips on where to eat.  The studio was very comfortable, clean, and well decorated. The lodging allows for both privacy and access to friendly and informative hosts. Doug and Lori were extraordinarily accommodating. They have excellent property in an amazing neighborhood - Ballard is just as exciting to explore as downtown Seattle! Highly recommended!  We had a great time at the Studio Cottage!  Doug and Lori were both extremely nice and made great local suggestions for places to visit and eat, etc.  The room was very clean and neat, with a wicked comfy bed and nice bathroom.  We particularly enjoyed experiencing Seattle from a neighborhood OUTSIDE of downtown.  We brought our bikes and explored for miles on the numerous bike paths accessible just a few blocks away.  I definitely recommend! This is a gem!\\r\\nDoug and Lori are fantastic hosts. The room is very spacious with lots of privacy and there is lots to do within the neighbourhood.\\r\\nHopefully we will make it down to Seattle soon and stay here again! I was just in town for one night, but this was a great to place to stay.  I was visiting a friend who lives in the Ballard neighborhood, so the location was perfect. Clean, quiet, private, and close to funky restaurants and shops.  The perfect place to lay our tired heads after a full day on the town.  Doug and Lori were great hosts and they provided some excellent suggestions for dining out. Clean and private space in nice neighborhood close to everything. Doug and Lori made us feel very welcome and gave us good advice to nearby dining etc. I can easily recommend staying here. Doug and Lori\\'s studio cottage was perfect for what we needed.  Located in a wonderful neighborhood within walking distance to the best of Ballard, the cottage is simple and wonderfully kept.  It is small and cozy but perfect for a couple looking to spend the day outdoors exploring.  Quiet neighborhood for nights and easy access to other cool neighborhoods in the area.  And Doug and Lori are incredibly nice and helpful, great suggestions on the area, and wonderful with check in.  If you are looking for a small and affordable Seattle get away, the studio cottage is perfect!\\r\\n  Would stay again in a heartbeat. Thanks for a wonderful experience.\\r\\nBrad and Nicole Staying at Doug and Lori\\'s made our first trip to Seattle just perfect. Their location was ideal. Quiet and private but close to anything we wanted. I highly recommend their studio cottage as a great alternative to impersonal and generic hotels. The Studio Cottage was absolutely charming - so different than staying in a motel.  The french doors made it feel like staying at a friend\\'s house.  We made use of the bench just outside the door for reading in the sun.  The cottage is within walking distance of the public library and the QFC market.  The gardens on the property are extensive and lovely.  My husband really liked the chickens on the property.  Lori and Doug were friendly and available.  We would definitely stay at the Studio Cottage again.  This is the perfect spot for our out of town guests visiting us in Ballard.  The location is awesome and the accommodations/hosts are great.   My fiancee and I felt welcome and the cottage was as described.  The location is amazing i.e., walking distance to Shilshole, Golden Gardens, Ray\\'s Boathouse etc..  We had a good time just walking around the neighborhood looking at the wonderful houses and yards Doug and Lori were fantastic hosts. The room was perfect for us. It was very clean and in the perfect location to enjoy both Ballard and the city. It\\'s in walking distance to all of the great Ballard restaurants and shops as well as an easy commute to the city by bus. Doug and Lori were also so helpful in answering all of our questions about the area and gave some fantastic restaurant recommendations. We would definitely stay here again! A nice private, quit room close to downtown. The perfect hosts for Ballard! Gave us great info on the area and are so friendly. The room is clean, well-decorated, and gives you privacy. Great bed too. Lorie also has an amazing garden which you can admire. A great private suite! Highly recommended. Doug and Lori were great hosts! Sorry the stay was so short!! My mother, little dog - Louie, and I found this cute little studio to be a delightful retreat. Mini-fridge was a nice bonus for leftover dinner pizza. Enjoyed the little bench outside and the garden. And we are thankful that they were able to accommodate us last minute. Good street parking too. \\r\\n Doug and Lori were wonderful!  They are there if you need anything!   Had the pleasure of staying here for a couple of days and I must say that Doug and Lori are some of the kindest and most welcoming hosts I have had the pleasure of meeting. I would rent this place again just to go hang out with them!  The studio is a cozy place to land in the heart of Ballard. It is an easy walk to destination coffee shops, the farmers market and the locks. The hosts are warm and welcoming. This little space in Ballard is super clean, quiet and cozy with fantastic artsy details that made staying there fun. I felt very safe to stay there by myself. In addition,  Doug and Lori went out of their way to make my stay very nice or more ways than one.  Don\\'t hesitate to stay here! It\\'s simply wonderful.  Great location if you want peace and quiet. Easy to book, check in, and check out. Doug and Lori are very nice and helpful from the time of booking and during the stay. I will be back for sure.  Doug and Lori were awesome hosts who provided a lot of great information about local restaurants and attractions. They were very accommodating, friendly, and vibrant. The studio is very cozy and absolutely adorable! It served as an excellent \"home base\" as we adventured around Seattle and it is located within walking distance of everything Ballard has to offer. We would have no hesitation in recommending this place to anyone and would certainly stay here again ourselves. Great neighborhood. If you are not a walker, bring a car, though. Five minute walk to Walter\\'s for morning coffee and conversation, but it\\'s uphill. Ten to 15 minute walk to dinner and drinks. Bus system was not designed for tourists. \\r\\n\\r\\nRoom was cozy for two, but we did not spend lots of time there.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat hosts. Love the yards. Love the fact that Lori had a charge cord for Carol\\'s computer. We rented this place due to its proximity to the Ballard strip. Also a quick 10 minute walk to the Salmon Locks. The room and bathroom were cozy, and I don\\'t mean in the misleading nomenclature kind of way. The room was equipped with large opening windows and an opening skylight for airflow and light. The bed was very comfortable for the two of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou won\\'t spend much time in this room, but it does what it was designed to do and then some; Sleep very comfortably, relax, recover, get out into the city. Quaint neighborhood and only a 15 minute walk to the Ballard nightlife. The garden and chickens is a nice rustic feel. It should be used more, as we were hoping to run into some of the other Bed and Breakfast tourists who were there. But probably most people are on the go. Lori was very helpful, and only a minute away if we had any troubles. Perfect location with easy access to Ballard and Downtown Seattle.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  This was a great home base for exploring Seattle and surrounding areas.  Doug and Lori were very nice and offered a lot of helpful information regarding things to do in the area.  I would definitely stay here again! Simple, bright and sweet.  This was a perfect spot to catch some zzz\\'s between busy activities in Ballard. Lovely room in Ballard in quiet neighborhood in easy walking distance to the wonderful Chittenden Locks.  The studio was conveniently accessed and in a great neighborhood. Perfect set up and clean and nicely decorated. Met both hosts and they each were a delight. Will be heading back there soon.  Great location and great hosts,comfortable space  My husband and I had a great last minute overnight urban vacation staying with Lori and Doug! Close to downtown Ballard, the water and lots of great restaurants and shops. We would definitely stay there for an overnight again!   Had a great time staying in Doug and Lori\\'s bungalow. The hosts were friendly and helpful. There were two of us, and the room was cozy and efficient. The skylight provided nice light and the floor heating kept environs comfortable. The location is not too far from NW Market shops and restaurants. Easy walk to Chittenden locks and park.  Really enjoyed Ballard and surrounding areas much more than downtown touristy stuff. Had some great breakfasts/brunches in the area.  The Studio Suite is as advertised: clean, as inviting as pictured and in a fantastic neighborhood. We had exceptional weather so being able to have the windows and skylight open was a plus. With the curtains drawn for privacy, the space still had plenty of light. Radiant heating kept the whole room comfortable, and there is a large, cushy area rug to land your feet on in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoug and Lori were excellent hosts from the first correspondence. We met Doug as we headed out for a run, and he recommended a fun route. We happened upon Lori in the garden, and she was quick to mention the aptly named Sunset Hill Park; the view is spectacular. They easily accommodated our past-midnight check-in.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are looking for a small, quiet place from which to walk to breakfast, a beach, coffee shops and even a small grocer, the studio is perfect for a single traveler or couple. Great place to stay! Cute studio apartment within walking distance to many different venues. Love the area! We met the host on the last day of our trip. They were very friendly. The neighborhood was wonderful, though a bit far from downtown, but that had more to do with our needs in Seattle than the actual location. I wish we could have spent more time in Ballard. Delightfully close to the locks, a must see. There is a lovely skylight that woke us up on sunny mornings, so if you don\\'t like to rise with the sun bring a sleep mask.  Doug and Lori are awesome host.   The Studio was just what we expected and the neighborhood is amazing.  If you are looking for a quaint, nice place to stay within walking distance to Ballard and may local attractions this is your place.  I highly recommend. What a great little room. We have a small dog that was welcome and gave us  place close to downtown Ballard.  I would have liked a tv but we only stayed a short time, so worked great. Doug & Lori are amazing hosts! Super accommodating and friendly. They even had the courtesy to call us after we forgot a few personal items after checking out. Fantastic location for exploring Ballard. Small, quiet and quaint. Great for one person or a couple - and dog friendly :) Listing was exactly as posted. A great little place right near charming downtown Ballard. Doug and Lori were great hosts. Check-in and check-out couldn\\'t be easier. Lori offered some great places to go and visit and each one that I visited was great. I really enjoyed my stay here. Comfortable, clean, basic accommodations in a very quiet part of a great neighborhood.  We had a busy weekend in Seattle so were not looking for a place in which to hang out and spend a lot of time but a convenient, reasonable place to sleep - it was perfect for our needs.  Studio is light and very cheery and set in a beautiful urban farm. I loved my stay here. It was quiet, comfortable, and private. Lori greeted me with a neighborhood map and great suggestions for things to check out in the neighborhood. Ballard is lovely and charming, and everything you might need or want is within walking distance. Golden Gardens is a gorgeous spot nearby.  I was on a work trip and found that the August hotel prices were very high, and most decent places were sold out, but  I was lucky to find this place.  Doug and Lori\\'s cottage was very nice, within walking distance of all the Ballard attractions. We had a great time in the two days we spent there. The neighborhood was quaint and quiet. The skylight was an extra bonus, giving lots of natural light.  I had an easy and great experience with Doug and Lori. They communicated all the details, and checking in was easy as could be. This little spot was exactly what my girlfriend and I needed, and we had everything we needed. The location was perfect, and located just a short downhill walk to downtown Ballard. We really enjoyed staying at Doug and Lori\\'s studio. The studio is separate from the house, which was great because we did not have to worry about waking anybody up when we came in late after a wedding. They provided bedding, linens, hair dryer, soap, shampoo and conditioner, and even had several soft drinks/mineral waters in the mini fridge; the studio was very clean, too. There is easy street parking nearby, and it is in a good neighborhood. We will definitely request to stay here again for future visits to Seattle! The studio was comfy, cozy and clean.  It was a perfect spot for me in a quiet neighborhood near friends.  Doug and Lori were great hosts and flexible with the arrival time.   Lori made our arrival super easy, even though the little place is a bit hard to locate the first time. Good, quiet neighborhood. Easy walk (downhill) to breakfast; L &D\\'s suggestions for restaurants were accurate and useful. We enjoyed our three night stay here very much. There are nearby (caged) chickens and a vegetable garden on the sidewalk nearby. We liked the country feel in a big city. You might want a car to make best use of this slightly out-of-the-way location, however. Everything was clean and well kept up. Could use more storage space (maybe shelves on a wall?) and better reading lights. As a final positive, Lori happily printed out our return boarding passes for us. The neighborhood of Ballard was lovely and I loved Doug and Lori\\'s suggestions for coffee shops and places to eat.  I could walk to the farmer\\'s market on Sunday and to the Locks very easily.  When I would see Doug or Lori in passing, they were very friendly and interesting to talk to.  Otherwise, the carriage house was quiet, bright and comfortable. Lori was very pleasant hostess, I felt there like at home. There was very cozy and clean, close to bus and shop. I like to go back there sometime. All communication from the initial booking was smooth and accurate.  The room was ready whenever I got into town and settled.  When I got to the room, it was well appointed, clean and comfortable.  All pictures shown from the AirBnB site was exact. I enjoyed my stay at the studio suite. \\r\\nThe description was exactly as described. It was in a very nice and safe location.  I plan to stay there my next visit and would definitely recommend it.\\r\\n I love my stay at Doug and Lori\\'s place! Great location, comfy and cozy! It was perfect for my two day business trip in Seattle - a nice Space to relax at the end of my day.  The space was just as listed. Its very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is fantastic. You\\'re just far enough from Ballard Ave that there\\'s no noise and it\\'s easy to park, but close enough to walk to everything.  And by everything I mean really fantastic restaurants, bars, coffee, shopping and nature :) We only saw Lori for a few brief moments but she was very friendly and helpful, a real joy.  We stayed here for two nights while attending a wedding in Discovery Park.  The place is very comfortable and exactly as described. Check in/out was a breeze, and it is located within walking distance (0.5mi)  to lots of great restaurants, the Ballard locks, and Shilshole Marina.  Just as nice as the B&B was! Doug and Lori go out of their way to make your stay comfortable and ensure you have what you need. They continue to be my home when in the Seattle office.  We had a most comfortable stay in a clean, well organized unit with the added benefit of easy street parking. Extremely smooth process with checking in/out. Great space and represented well on this site. Loved the heated floors! The bed was also very comfortable. Although it\\'s small, it was a great space for 1-2 people.  Another great stay with Doug and Lori! \\r\\nLovely space with everything we need, great neighbourhood, and easy to get around town. I had a great stay in Doug and Lori\\'s Studio. Everything I needed was provided. The place was easy to locate and check in and check out was a breeze. I would stay here again. Great location in Ballard. Double review because I extended my stay. I had a great stay in Doug and Lori\\'s Studio. Everything I needed was provided. The place was easy to locate and check in and check out was a breeze. I would stay here again. Great location in Ballard. This is our second time staying in this room.  It\\'s a nice little cozy space and in a great location in Ballard.   Doug and Lori were great hosts.  They gave us great directions, making it easy to find the place and get into the Studio.  They also gave us lots of great suggestions on where to eat and hang out around the neighborhood.  The Studio was close enough to walk to shops, bars and restaurants in the cute Ballard Blocks neighborhood.  We didn\\'t spend too much time at the Studio but it was everything we needed: a comfy bed, bathroom, clean, and easy.  Overall great stay.  I would definitely recommend staying here.   Our hosts have very thoughtfully appointed this cottage with everything you need and information on visiting Seattle.  It\\'s a compact space without a working or lounging space, but it\\'s very comfortable and a good price.  On-street parking was never a problem.  We missed our chance to meet our hosts, though I plan to check in with them during the summer months to see their extensive vegetable gardens during the growing season. We had a great stay at Doug & Lori\\'s studio cottage. We spent the majority of our time wandering and exploring Seattle and the cottage was a great home base. It was clean, cozy and quiet - pretty much everything we were looking for.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at the map, we were worried it would be tough to get around without a car, but it was actually incredibly easy! There\\'s a bus stop nearby that can take you downtown and plenty of dining options within walking distance. Staying at Doug and Lori\\'s was great. The space is private, cozy, affordable, and in a beautiful neighborhood, just a short walk from the beach, bike rentals, great food and parks. The space is small but it has everything you could need for a stay. Though I never got to meet them in person, Doug and Lori were easy to communicate with (prompt responders) and very friendly and helpful with recommendations. Their space is truly lovely. Thank you guys! Lots of guidebooks on the city. Room was as promised.  The studio suite was very comfortable and in a great location. Our stay was really great and our hosts, Doug & Lori, were very nice and offered helpful info during our stay. The studio suite was just as it was described in the listing and it suited our needs very well. Would definitely consider staying again when traveling to Seattle. Lori and Doug were great and provide an excellent accommodation!  Great location, quiet, lovely neighborhood.  Just walk down the hill to the locks.  1 to 2 minutes to colorful downtown Ballard.  Nice cozy quiet cottage.  I\\'ll be back.  Thank you team Lori and Doug! The studio was lovely, and even nicer than the photos! Lori and Doug sent information about the neighborhood ahead of time that was very useful, and were extremely accommodating about our schedule and requests. Highly recommended as a quiet base to explore the area from. Wonderful and perfect place to stay in Ballard. Will hopefully be back again. Description was accurate and hosts were very responsive to requests.  Beautiful little room in a quiet neighborhood. My boyfriend and I loved staying at Doug and Lori\\'s Studio Suite while visiting Seattle. The place was really cozy and clean, and filled with special details: fun books and guides about Seattle, a selection of herbal teas and coffee, hand made organic soap, and all different kinds of bathroom essentials. We slept really well in the comfy bed and loved the peacefulness of the neighborhood. The suite is perfectly located in the neighborhood of Ballard and we were able to walk to restaurants, cafes, the Ballard Sunday Farmers Market, Stone Gardens Climbing/Bouldering Gym, and the Ballard Locks. We were also in close driving distance to Trader Joe\\'s (there is a little fridge in the studio to store goodies) and to other neighborhoods in Seattle so we never felt that we had to drive a ton to get places. We got a chance to meet Doug and Lori and we got some awesome recommendations on different places to eat (you must try Walrus & the Carpenter!). They are both really nice and friendly and were very respectful of our privacy. They were also flexible in accepting our late arrival. They have a beautiful edible garden, a loving dog, and some chickens. We will be staying here again on our next trip to Seattle.  Doug & Lori were very accommodating to my boyfriend, black lab, and I when we needed 4 nights of housing between leases. Most places turned us down because of the size of our dog but they allowed him in their space. It is small and does not have a kitchen as advertised but they include a fridge with beverages & snacks. It had more than I expected overall and was perfect for us. The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and walking distance to the Locks, and a bit longer walk includes Golden Gardens beach & all the fun shopping & eating Ballard has to offer. I would recommend this to any traveler, and it is super easy to get around from here without a car. If you go in summer, you\\'ll be able to see their urban garden! We were also a big fan of their unique tile work & stained glass in the studio. The guests were there to welcome us.  We had a comfy bed and plenty of choices to provide cooling air into the room as it was in the 80\\'s.  We were able to walk to dinner on the water and walk to a great coffee shop in the morning.  The homemade mint hand soap was a nice touch. Shortly after I arrived, Lori was there to greet me. It was my third stay in the studio suite and will book it again since my daughter lives a few blocks away. It is in a very safe, quiet, and lovely neighborhood. It is convenient  to downtown Ballard and many fine restaurants. \\r\\nThe suite is cozy with everything you need.\\r\\nI highly recommend it. This studio was a perfect little space to stay for a couple night! Clean, quiet and of course, in a fun part of the city. The hosts were great and provided a welcoming atmosphere when I arrived. I would highly recommend staying here This was my first airbnb. Lori was very nice and gave great advice on where to go. Our new favorite place was one she suggested at the Ballard Locks. She was very accommodating when I realized that I needed to schedule another night. I loved waking up to the sounds of the chickens and the horns of the boats on the Puget Sound. As I am a new airbnb user I didn\\'t realize that the owners would check us in and then leave for a few days. So that is just a learning curve thing for me. Not altogether unpleasant but just unexpected. On her end she had to deal with a new airbnb user who didn\\'t schedule the right number of nights. I miss Seattle already. New favorite place.  Lovely spot right along the 58th bike route.\\r\\nThe setting was very welcoming and we enjoyed sitting outside on the yard swing.\\r\\nNo bike rack but the tree worked great.\\r\\n Lori and Doug are friendly. The room is spacious for one, cozy for two, and they had cold beverages waiting for us in the mini fridge, which was lovely given that there was a heat wave in Seattle when we were there! Neighborhood is very walkable and very residential, with commercial district that has a wide range of shops and restaurants within walking distance. Views of Puget Sound and Ocean are also within walking distance, which is also a big bonus. Room was tidy upon our arrival, and Lori and Doug have thought of a lot of details that you would find in a traditional hotel room, like extra shampoo and soap, an electric kettle and supply of tea. Loved the chicken coop and listening to them coo and talk when people were around. Everything was just as described: comfortable private studio in a nice and safe neighborhood. Doug and Lori provided a recommended list of places to eat, easy directions to the studio and were always prompt in their correspondences. This was my first time using airbnb and after this experience I will be using it more. I was a little concerned because I was traveling alone, but the neighborhood (Ballard) is very safe. I was in Seattle on a weekend and there was a street festival in Ballard which re-routed the buses and made commuting via public transportation difficult and lengthy – so I would recommend using taxi/uber. I also arrived late in the evening and was concerned about calling due to the time, but Lori was not bothered at all and was very pleasant to talk to. This was our first experience with Airbnb and we were very pleased with the outcome. Doug and Lori were great hosts! Every little detail you could imagine was included- lots of maps and info about the city were provided as well as complimentary treats. The neighborhood was  peaceful and full of places to eat and drink. I would recommend this location to everyone.  Lovely studio, good atmosphere and great help when in need from lovely hosts. Cozy location, easy access to all Seattle. Highly recommended  Doug and Lori\\'s pad is just great! It is a perfect little comfort zone, and so well located. Doug and Lori provided lots of helpful information and I found my now favourite new breakfast place globally :-) We had a great time, can only recommend it and will definitely be back :-) My husband and I had the perfect little weekend getaway at Doug and Lori\\'s studio. The location was great, super quick drive to the Ballard ave. and probably a pretty quick walk as well. The studio itself was very comfortable and was stocked with all the necessary amenities. They really thought of everything! Very much a home away from home. We never crossed paths with Doug and Lori during our stay, but kept in contact through messaging. Lori was super helpful in the weeks leading up to our stay with so many recommendations that made it super helpful and easy to venture out in a new area in Seattle. Would definitely love to come back sometime in the future!  A charming little studio, the sheets were soft, the water pressure was great, and the air flow from the sky light and window was so good that even with the record highs I didn\\'t need to turn on the air. Doug and Lori had great food and travel suggestions, even dropping off a beach towel when the weather was unexpectedly hot. With the private entry they felt like friendly neighbors. Parking was effortless; with parks, coffee shops, and downtown Ballard an easy walk away (according to my FitBit their are a lot of hills). The wifi was great for planning the day ahead, and they helpfully included some maps of Ballard, Seattle, and some of the other neighborhoods. The studio suite at Doug and Lori\\'s was perfect for our trip.  As described in the listing, clean efficient and had everything we needed.  We spent the weekend checking out Ballard and downtown, parking was easy and the studio is very conveniently located.  We easily walked to the waterfront in Ballard.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would definitely stay again! Perfect place for us... this trip to Seattle was all about Ballard, Fremont & Magnolia, so if that\\'s where you\\'re going this is a great spot.\\r\\nClose to everything, and enjoyed three walks to the beach.\\r\\nBest:\\r\\nR/S The host provided detailed information before our arrival, had more detailed information in a binder (anticipating any possible questions with info about neighborhood, etc.) and greeted us shortly after our arrival.  This was our first airbnb experience and because it was such a positive one, we will be sure to continue with airbnb when we travel again. Lori and Doug are very fine hosts and we enjoyed our stay in their studio!  We\\'re Airbnb hosts too, and needed a place to stay while we rented out our own house.  The Sunset Hill neighbrhood is a great place to be: close to neighborhood greenways, Ballard, and the ocean, so we just were so happy to be in a nicely appointed studio so conveniently located!   Doug and Lori are great hosts! Their information and resources made it very easy to get down town and explore seattle. The studio its self is a very clean and a lovely place to stay. Doug and Lori were great hosts, unfortunately we never got to meet them face to face but that was never a problem. The room was comfy and clean, well located and just what we were looking for. Had a great time. We had very minimal contact with Lori and Doug, but they were very sweet and the room was lovely. We stayed in several airbnb\\'s while on vacation last week, and their bed was by far the most comfortable! It was totally private and we felt comfortable coming and going as needed. They had a very nice set up with anything you may have forgotten or didn\\'t have room to pack (hair dryer, shampoo, soap, etc).  The room is detached from the house and has a full bathroom and mini fridge, but no kitchen. This wasn\\'t a problem for us since seattle\\'s amazing restaurants were part of the draw for our visit, but something to be aware of. They do however have an electric tea kettle, tea and instant coffee, which i thought was very convenient. I would definitely recommend staying with Doug and Lori, and would stay with them again!  This was the perfect location for a girls get away. Had easy access to all the great activities Seattle\\'s has to offer.  The stay with Lori and Doug was Lovely! The room is nice and comforting in a safe and beautiful neighborhood. Walking distance to everything fun in Ballard! I also loved the (quiet) chickens in the garden! : ) Would stay here again. Stay was perfect!  The room is lovely and we had no trouble checking in or out.  The location is about 20/25 minutes from downtown Seattle, but there is a cute low-key downtown area with shops and food less than 5 minutes away.  It was very peaceful and the Doug and Lori were gracious and responsive hosts! Our experience was wonderful! It was clean, bright and cozy in Doug and Lori\\'s studio. It was easy to find and my son loved talking to the chickens. Our next trip to Seattle we will for sure be staying here again.  It was really nice! Perfect size for two people. Very nice accommodations. The location was good, within walking distance of everything in Ballard and very close to bus stops to get downtown and anywhere else. The bathroom included a little \\'oops I forgot box\\' it had any toiletries you could think of. Very thoughtful of the owners to have that. We had a great time!   This is a great place to stay if you\\'re looking for a quiet place to get some sleep in town. It was very private and pleasant. I didn\\'t get to meet Doug and Lori, but for some it may be a plus to have some alone time. Everything I needed & then some.\\nThe room is stocked w/ great books on local history as well as current points of interest. Also teas, coffee,  wifi, lots of towels, & a small fridge with drinks.  More than I\\'d expect.\\nCozy & quiet inside as well as outside. The neighborhood was quiet & felt safe & plenty of well lit street parking, unlike many area neighborhoods.\\nThe sink/cabinet upgrade gives more counter space as well as drawers for necessities. Oh & the basket of \"I forgots\" !  Yea I did, thanks !  I am so glad I\\'ve already made reservations for the rest of my dates  Great place. Very privat with own bathroom and a small fridge. Doug & Lori have done a lot to make the place varm and cozy with pillows and books to read on a rainy day. Better than described. Very close to puplic transports and besides being very friendly our host was so kind to provide us with travel plans to and from the airport. Highly recommended. Looking forward to my next stay with Doug & Lori. Doug and Lori have a sweet alley studio. It was a squeeze with our son in his pack n play but they made it cozy! Heated floors, hot showers, space heater, comfy robes, great light, and refreshments made the inside special. Our son loved the chickens and we loved the quiet location. Doug and Lori were very pleasant and accommodating. Thank you! Cozy & quiet, all the local literature makes me wish to come back when I\\'m not on business so I can go exploring. I LOVE that there\\'s NO TV  comfy cozy and clean as can be! might have to return when I need an escape again as I felt utmost relaxation at Lori and Doug\\'s. thanks guys!! James, my Airbnb host, was very courteous and friendly. He was generous in providing privacy, respect and friendliness while I stayed with him. The room and bathroom were very clean, private and comfortable.  The bed was very comfortable and restful.  The neighborhood felt safe, relaxed, and  walking distance to Ballard amenities of eating and drinking.  I would return to James room and recommend it to anyone interested. \\r\\n   James is very friendly and accommodating. The room was cozy but with plenty of space. It\\'s close to the train which seemed to stop between midnight and 7am or 8am. Location is fantastic! Ballard central neighborhood is lively, but he lives down a quiet street. I\\'d definitely recommend James, and stay there again. We felt vary welcome, and found James to be a great host Great little room and wonderful host. No complaints and very easy process! Fantastic home in great location.  James is a superb host.  We wish we had more time to hang out there. Enjoyed our conversations.  Very comfortable and would love to stay again.  Five Stars. Like staying with a friend of a friend. James made us feel very welcome, gave us lots of useful tips on what to do, and is fascinating to talk with. The room is clean and comfortable, and Ballard is an interesting and convenient neighborhood. Highly recommended! I had a great week! James was wonderful to talk with, very welcoming, and shared lots of local knowledge about good restaurants and history of the neighborhood. There are dozens of amazing places to eat and shop in Ballard, you will never be bored or hungry, including lots of awesome happy hours. I walked everywhere during my stay and had no trouble taking public transportation to and from the airport. Proximity to locks was a big highlight for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was clean and comfortable. I especially liked the soft sheets, big fluffy towels, and strong morning coffee. Thank you James for sharing your home. :) My first airbnb experience and it couldn\\'t have been better. James is a great host and has a great little place in a fantastic neighborhood (15 min by car/25min by bus from downtown Seattle). Very convenient. James was a great host. We felt extremely comfortable and safe not only in Ballard but also in his home. We came and went as we pleased and James was always available if we had questions, needed suggestions, or just wanted to chat. The location is just west of all the shops, restaurants, and bars in Ballard and everything was within walking distance for us. If you don\\'t need all the amenities that hotels offer and you want to explore a quieter but hip neighborhood then this is a great place. I will definitely be reaching out to James next time I travel to Seattle.  James was a gracious host. He was very prompt to respond to any messages. Additionally, he was flexible regarding a late check in, early check out, and even a change of guest. The place itself was as described. Since I needed a place in Ballard on short notice, this was a great find to suit my needs. There was no availability at the nearby hotels and this booking prevented me from needing to rent a car during my trip to Seattle. Location is very walkable with Hiram Chittenden Locks, shops, and restaurants all nearby. I would recommend this place and would stay there again. James was very communicative, flexible, and considerate. He did a great job of making me feel welcome, plus his dog is adorable. The place is in a great location, just a short walk to a number of cute Ballard bars and shops. James was easy going and made us feel right at home. Place was clean, almost like a hotel room in the room. Great walking access to Ballard nightlife and the locks. James was an excellent host, friendly, helpful and made us feel very welcome. We enjoyed staying with him very much. The accommodations were clean and comfortable, the neighbourhood is pleasant - and top marks for the location, walking distance to the happening heart of Ballard! James was super prompt responding to my request.  His location is the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle is really great, walking distance to the Locks, Golden Gardens and the shopping area.  James\\' home is a charming duplex.  Unfortunately, this is a smoking household.  My husband has asthma and it was a problem for us.   We stayed one night at James place. He made us feel very welcome, even invited us for a wine and gave us a tour around the amazing house he is building. James is a great guy and the room is at a perfect spot! James made us feel at home immediately! I cannot recommend his place enough. Whether hanging out at the locks, sampling the nearby cuisine or traveling into the city center, James house is perfectly positioned for all types of fun. James local knowledge was indeed a welcome fringe benefit. We only wish we could have stayed at his place for longer than we were able. Well, I have to agree with all the other positive posts about James\\' place - cute house, perfect location in Ballard, and courteous host. The room was just what I needed, and the bed divine. As one other reviewer said, it was like staying with the friend of a friend. Comfortable and casual. Quiet neighborhood within blocks of many great restaurants and little shops. Looking forward to booking again. We stayed in Ballard for one night and really enjoyed our experience. James was a fabulous host and made us feel at home. The house is in a perfect location - walking distance to everything we wanted to see. We would definitely recommend this listing to anyone visiting the area.  Wonderful hosts! Very easy to work with. Space was lovely and cozy. Well appointed, very clean and quiet. Guests were beyond pleased. Will most definitely recommend to friends and neighbors! Upon arrival we were warmly received by our hosts and given a short tour of a quaint and charming downstairs apartment.  Despite the fact that it was a basement, it received plenty of natural light via the half-windows which lined the outside walls. The apartment had a great kitchen area and a welcome board with pertinent information such as contact phone numbers and wi-fi passwords.  The bed was comfortable, the shower pressure and water was good, and the towels were soft.  It\\'s also not far from central Ballard.  Although we only stayed for a night, we experienced enough to have no hesitation about booking here in the future. I\\'ve stayed at a lot of Airbnb\\'s, this was one of the best for a well priced well kept \"entire apt.\" Take advantage while it\\'s still a bargain, you won\\'t regret it! I traveled with my niece and we both love our stay.  We meet Anne when we got there and felt welcomed:) The description of the place is accurate. And it was perfect for us.  I would definitely recommend the place.   Ann\\'s place was perfect for our week-long thanksgiving visit.  It\\'s spacious and private, with it\\'s own entrance, cozy and filled with great reading materials.  Communication and organizing arrival was very smooth.  Ann\\'s place is a couple of blocks from a stunning view of the mountains and the sound.  We feel very fortunate to have stayed here.  Thank you Ann! Excellent!  Really wonderful apartment as described.  Very clean sheets/linens and living space.\\n\\nEnjoyed the selection of books.  Interior design features pretty cool.  Comfy Space... \\n\\nAnne greeted us and was very kind, fun, positive. Anne communicated with me regularly, right before I checked in and during my stay.  I was busy with meetings and did not get to meet her, but felt well attended to, regardless. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment was perfect for my needs.  Cozy, beautiful, plenty of space, and quiet.  The amenities were high quality and I really appreciated the attention to recycling and composting.  The neighborhood is lovely and is within walking distance of downtown Ballard (20 mins).  I parked my car at the house and walked and took the bus everywhere I needed to go for the time I was there. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would highly recommend Anne\\'s place.  We had an awesome stay at Anne and Erik\\'s pad.  Everything was clean and tidy.\\r\\nAnne and Louie (Cute little guy!) came to introduce themselves early on and checked with us by text after a couple of days to be sure we had everything we needed.  Nice neighborhood.  Quiet. No complaints. What a fantastic place to stay! Anne was incredibly welcoming and helpful. The unit was immaculate and well stocked with cooking supplies which is SO NICE! Every detail was taken into account from shampoo in the shower to soft duvet covers. I accidentally left my running shoes behind and Anne was so helpful in getting them back to me. I will definitely stay again next time I come to Seattle!  Lindsay is the most wonderful Airbnb host I have encountered. She made us feel more like house guests than renters.  The house is gorgeous, including spectacular views from the dining table, deck and master bedroom. The pictures do not do it justice.  Great location and easy drive to downtown Seattle, ferry to Bainbridge, hiking in the Cascades.  Would love to find similar arrangements in other cities I plan on visiting.  We travel via ABB quite often and have had many great experiences. Our stay at Lindsay\\'s Sunset Hill View Craftsman is by far the most outstanding yet! The home sits in Ballard, atop the bluff with an amazing view of the marina and Puget Sound. The home offers this beautiful view from just about every part of the house and property. We were in Seattle for my daughter\\'s college graduation. We needed a home with three bedrooms and baths and a kitchen fit for preparing a graduation dinner. We got this and so much more! The beds are over-the-top comfortable; Lindsay\\'s attention to bedding detail set the tone for a great night sleep. Thank you so much for that, Lindsay! The kitchen was completely stocked with every needed tool, was spacious, and bright. We were able to create a celebration dinner to be remembered. Lindsay\\'s home exudes peacefulness. It was a weekend of morning coffee and cribbage on the deck, afternoon walks to the many local spots, and evenings back on the deck or in the hot tub. Lindsay made it clear she wanted us to have a relaxing and enjoyable stay and that is exactly what we did! WOW!  What a wonderful home.  Lindsey was such an accommodating host and made us feel welcome from the beginning.  We ended up arriving early due to our taxi taking half the time google maps said it would but Lindsey was extremely welcoming, inviting us to come on in.  A much needed bottle of wine was left on the table with a nicely made binder of instructions for the house and local places to eat and things to see. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was absolutely beautiful and pictures can not do the view from the deck justice.  My family and I thoroughly enjoyed just hanging out on the deck and spending time with one another. We didn\\'t have a car so that did make it a little difficult to get into the city but it\\'s only a $20 Uber ride or you can get up early on weekday mornings to catch the express bus into downtown.  Even though transportation took a little bit more work on our part we all agreed that staying at Lindsey\\'s house was 100 times better than staying in a hotel in downtown Seattle.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end we all agreed we wish we could have stayed longer!  Lindsay\\'s home beyond perfect. We felt right at home and couldn\\'t get enough of the views. Definitely our best airbnb experience to date. Check in was a breeze and Lindsay was a gem, making sure we knew how to reach her and the ins and outs of the house. The house was impeccably clean and had everything we needed. I hope I get the chance to stay at her incredible home again, I\\'m already dreaming of those amazing sunset views from the deck. Thanks Lindsay! Lindsay is an incredible host- clear instructions and no detail spared. She responded to questions quickly.  Such a beautiful home! Wow, just wow. This place is beyond spectacular. The pictures don\\'t even do it justice. Amazing ocean views, wake up in the master loft to sunrise over the Puget Sound. Really made our weekend enjoyable for our Seattle wedding and provided great photo opps for our first look. Lindsay is very communicative and even took care of the plants I forgot on the patio until I could pick them up. You\\'d be remiss staying anywhere else for the price. Lindsay\\'s home is absolutely beautiful. It\\'s open, inviting, and accommodated three couples perfectly. Waking up to the Puget Sound out every window in the morning was such a lovely way to wake up. The kitchen has everything you need to cook up a nice meal or it\\'s just a short walk to grab a bite to eat. The beds are extremely comfortable and the hot tub on the porch was an added bonus! Lindsay is also very responsive to any questions. Thanks for allowing to stay in your home! We had the best time.  Perfect Seattle location, house and host.  Whether you are coming to Seattle to relax, hike, or experience the city, Lindsay\\'s home is a perfect location for all.  The most amazing part are the views from the balcony, the master bedroom, and living area.  They are even better than shown in the pictures.  This alone makes Lindsay\\'s a must stay.  Also, the interior of the home is spacious, clean, beautifully decorated, and easily accommodates 6 people.  And most importantly Lindsay is a wonderful AirBnB host.  Lindsay was flexible, always accessible, and extremely friendly.  Thanks so much Lindsay! The host canceled this reservation 70 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. We stayed at Lindsay\\'s house for a month while our house was being remodeled and have only good things to say about the experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor starters, the house has the most extraordinary view of the Olympic Mountains, Puget Sound and the Shilshole Marina from every floor. That in and of itself is reason to stay here. The house is also beautifully furnished and comfortable to stay in.\\r\\n\\r\\nLindsay is a wonderful host - responsive and attentive to any issues that arose. We\\'ve stayed at several Airbnbs and this is the best one yet. Highly recommend.  We stayed for one night for a 40th celebration for one of my best friends that lives in Portland. So we wanted a big enough place to cook in and just kick up our heels to relax with a view!\\r\\n We had dinner plans in the city and we quickly canceled once we opened the doors to this home! It was so glamorous and filled with so much to do. \\r\\nThe master bedroom upstairs was so peaceful with the views and automatic window shades were cool. The bed itself was luxurious and super cozy!\\r\\n\\r\\n We all need two more days to soak in all the wonders this place has to offer! We will be coming back yearly! On Sunday morning there was a small sail boat races that were fun to watch while we ate brunch. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you Lindsey for providing the coolest place I have ever stayed in. Wow priceless  This. House. I can\\'t say enough about my family\\'s Thanksgiving weekend here. Our jaws dropped as soon as we walked in and saw the view, and it never got old. The spacious, elegant kitchen was perfect for cooking our Thanksgiving feast, and we enjoyed many meals around the big, beautiful table. The location is fantastic - a short drive to lots of fun restaurants and breweries (though we always made sure to be \"home\" with a cocktail in our hands for sunset). The beds were comfortable, the big leather couch in the living room fit four of us comfortably for movie night, and did I mention the stunning views from every floor? This was a Thanksgiving to remember, thanks to our stay in this incredible home. Thank you, Lindsay, for sharing it with us! I can not say enough good things about this place! It has to be seen to be believed. It\\'s very difficult to capture in photos, but the view, the kitchen and overall function of the home are superb. Lindsay is first class as well. Very friendly, prompt and professional. You should be so lucky to stay here! This was our second time to rent Lindsay\\'s home... as long as Lindsay continues to open her home to others we will continue to enjoy this gem of a home. Just as we experienced during our first stay, this home served us so incredibly well! The spaciousness, the location, the comfort, and the amenities made for another amazing vacation. We were in Seattle for Christmas. Family from California, Colorado, and Washington all met in Seattle for one week. Our Colorado relatives had not before visited Seattle. To quote one of them, Lindsay\\'s house felt so much like Seattle that he wondered where Tom Hanks was. Lindsay and Jason made us feel more than welcome. They made sure we had Christmas lights outside and decorations inside. They even left a supply of Christmas wrap for our use. I am convinced this home feels so warm and welcoming because of the people who live in it. One of these days I bet we\\'ll meet Lindsay and Jason and when we do, we\\'ll most likely feel like we\\'re with family. Excellent service and top notch accommodations! Carol and Bruce are wonderful hosts! Will not hesitate to return again or recommend. Carol and Bruce live in a beautiful house in Ballard, overlooking Puget Sound and the Mountains.\\r\\nThey are amazing hosts - one night, when I got home completely wet from the rain, Carol brought me some Chili con Carne so I didn\\'t have to go out again. \\r\\nShe also left notes on my door with useful information (e.g., where I could find an additional comforter) and had a binder full with maps, restaurant tips, hiking trails and the like.\\r\\nTheir Golden Doodle Quasar is also very sweet. \\r\\nI can really recommend the room and the hosts. Charming family home in quiet nice neighborhood. A view of Puget Sound from our room was wonderful. Carol and her husband very welcoming. \\r\\nWe would stay here again happily.  Hi es war soooo beautiful place thanks so much, dear Carol and your husband.....\\r\\nVielen herzlichen Dank für die tolle Gastfreundschaft.\\r\\nLiebe Grüsse Irene and fam.\\r\\n Our host was most helpful and knowledgeable and oriented us to the Seattle area.  The view from the room is beautiful, even though the weather did not allow us to fully see the mountains in the distance.  Overlooking the sound and the moored boats and passing vessels was very pleasant.  Also, the proximity to so many interesting places to visit & eat in nearby Ballard was a real plus.  Carol, Bruce and Quasar were terrific!  Very welcoming and accommodating.  Quasar the wonderdog and the kids were hard to separate.  Our stay was all that we\\'d hoped: comfortable, clean, peaceful lovely space.  Thanks for the nice breakfast!  The view was beautiful, even with overcast days it was replenishing to wake up to the sweeping panorama.  Would stay again in a heartbeat. Had a wonderful stay! Hosts were very kind & welcoming.. loved my cozy & quiet room with an amazing view of the sound.. it was very easy to come & go & do my own thing.. organic breakfast goodies awaited me each morning. The location was great- quiet, with nice neighborhoods to walk around in, easy parking, close to get into town, etc.. Would definitely stay again- Thank you! We had a great time in Seattle at this beautiful location. The room is very comfortable, spacious, and clean, and the view really can\\'t be beat. Carol was very welcoming and helpful in getting us settled. We didn\\'t take advantage of the continental breakfast since there are some really great bakeries in the area, but it\\'s a nice option. A sanctuary for weary travelers! The room is clean, spacious, and unbelievably quiet. A complete break from the city. The view of the water, mountains, and visiting birds is a peaceful break from the day\\'s activities. Carol and Bruce and Quasar the dog provided just enough attention to make us feel at home, and left us plenty of space. We thoroughly enjoyed the special treats from the garden for breakfast. Highly recommend! We hope to be back. Carol and Bruce welcomed us openly into their home. We were in Ballard for a family wedding and Carol had no problem with us coming home late. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bedroom is upstairs in their home with an amazing view overlooking Puget Sound, Bainbridge Island and the Olympic mountain range. The coffee, juice, toast and fruit the next morning is a great added bonus. We sat with our morning coffee, overlooking the water. It was great. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighbourhood is very quiet with anything you need being 5-10 minutes drive away. Golden Gardens Park is right next door as well. Check out the Ballard Sunday farmers market too. Good experience. Spacious room, comfortable bed, tremendous view, good communication, gracious host. Carol and Bruce were both great hosts for my family and I when we visited Seattle. The house is beautiful, and the view of the mountains is even better than it appears in the pictures. Carol even offered us some of her homemade zucchini bread, and it was such a treat to have some for breakfast the next day. Living together with Carol and Bruce likes living in family, they are very hospitable and considerate. When waking up in the morning and opening the curtain, you will be attracted by the beautiful landscape from the window of your room. If we will have a trip to Seattle, here is still our first choice. Carol\\'s room is exactly as advertised.  The view is outstanding, the location is quiet (an occasional barking seal) and the hosts are very accommodating.  A great place to stay.   We loved our stay. The hosts were welcoming and helpful, the room was clean and comfortable, and the location could not have been better. We would come here again.    Carol\\'s home is cozy, quiet, impeccably clean, and certainly does have an incredible view. She made my husband and I feel extremely welcome and breakfast was delicious. We especially loved petting Quasar!\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly recommend staying here if you\\'re in Seattle.  What a wonderful home! Carol and Bruce were fantastic hosts, we felt super comfortable and loved the views!!!  Carol made us a wonderful zucchini bread for our first morning staying there, along with lots of fresh fruit and coffee:).  The beds are super comfortable, and we had full access to our own private bathroom.  We also took advantage of the backyard space which has tremendous views of Puget sound and Shilshole Bay.  There\\'s also an awesome beach nearby that our daughter loved and we spent a lot of time there.  Very close to downtown, yet a quiet retreat from the city!  We would definitely stay here again next time we\\'re in Seattle! Carol was very friendly and recommended many places I could visit during my short stay. This BnB has a fantastic view, the continental breakfast was filling and if you have time the beach is ridiculously close by. If I return to Seattle for work I would look up Carol again! Carol was a fantastic hostess that went above and beyond to provide a spectacular experience at her beautiful home. The room was exactly as described, cozy and comfortable with an unbelievable view. Carol and her partner Bruce were extremely friendly, and even baked us a delicious zucchini bread to have with breakfast (in addition to everything else she provided for breakfast, which was by far the best airbnb breakfast I\\'ve ever had). I would absolutely stay with her again, worth every penny.  Carol was a wonderful hostess ! My daughter and I stayed there for one night. I have gluten allergies and she was very accommodating with our breakfast! )) Thank You Carol Carol and Bruce were wonderful hosts. The room was very spacious and comfortable and the view was beautiful. Breakfast every day was great and plentiful. Close to area attractions and street parking was easily available right outside. Quasar the puppy is adorable. We would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle.  Really beautiful home with friendly hosts and great views. We had a lovely stay-just in town for a wedding in Golden Gardens Park. Morning breakfast with a view of the ocean and mountains was a treat.  We have had a wonderful stay in a cosy room at a quiet location with an exceptional view at Olympic National Park. We enjoyed the city but also the delicious breakfast at Carols and Bruce\\' place. Both are wonderful hosts. Carol is a gracious host, visiting with us about the area.  We enjoyed her hospitality.  Our room was clean and had a beautiful view of Puget Sound. The view is the best I\\'ve seen in Ballard. I appreciate that Carol keeps in great communication and cares so passionately to provide a positive hosting experience. As a good and bad thing, the room is silent, as in quieter than quiet. That\\'s very nice, as you don\\'t hear the sounds from outside. That said, make sure to bring something that can offer music or ambient noise. The sounds of nature outside are great. Overall, I would definitely recommend it! Carol went above and beyond for this special stay. My husband and I cannot express enough gratitude in sharing her beautiful home with us. \\n\\nCarol was very easy to communicate with from the start, via email and later through text. She graciously allowed us to check in early, a much welcomed gesture from our flight and schedule change. Upon arrival she gave us a thorough tour and provided us our privacy and quiet time for a productive day of sleeping. The cherry on top was  having breakfast ready outside our door by 100am the following morning. We engorged on the fresh, organic choices and tasty filtered water. \\n\\nThe room itself was cozy and comfortable with plenty of extra blankets, towels, and a space heater. The view was a stunning backdrop for breakfast. We also had the whole second floor with access to our private bathroom. \\n\\nHonestly no complaints here. Carol puts her heart into her Airbnb and we would love to visit again.  Carol was fantastic! She was very friendly and had a great breakfast each morning - can\\'t recommend her highly enough! Beautiful house with a great view and plenty of personal space.  Carol was a great hostess, even leaving breakfast out in the morning. The neighborhood is lovely for nature lovers and those in need of some quiet time.  Absolutely gorgeous townhouse with all the amenities you can ask for.  Beautiful view in a great location.  Host was very fast at answering all questions and concerns.  Thanks for making it an unforgettable trip for the entire family. In general this is a great place and a good value in one of favourite neighbourhoods in Seattle. \\nThe positives, Phillip and Ting are well  organized and accommodating. Check was very easy. The place is well kept, new and clean. It is very spacious and the kitchen, roof deck, and beds are great. It\\'s also close to the locks and good running trails. \\nThe only negatives are that its very close to the train tracks. Like 75 ft. Bring your ear plugs cause there are a couple of trains a night. The second is that it is a stacked town house configuration with lots of stairs. Bedrooms are are 2 floors away which may or may not be desirable. All said we would stay again. The apartment indeed has beautiful views and an awesome roof deck. I found myself staring out of the tall windows watching the water and boats go past. I was apprehensive about the proximity to the train tracks. We stayed for four nights and for some reason, some nights the train noise was way worse than others - like it felt as though the train was passing once/hour. Some of the trains go on forever and they make a very loud screeching sound. Other nights, I barely heard the trains and if I did they didn\\'t bother me one bit. During the day, they are quite charming to watch go past. One thing that wasn\\'t clear is that the apartment is three stories tall. The master bedroom is on the top floor, the living room/kitchen is in the middle, and the bottom floor has a guest bedroom and separate office/bathroom. We traveled with our children and we felt a bit far from them. The bedrooms let in a lot of light in the morning, so we were all up very early (too early!).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe home is neat as a pin and was immaculately clean. I would recommend this place for a couple, but probably not the best arrangement for a family with young kids. The neighborhood is awesome and we loved walking to the shops and restaurants nearby, as well as going to the Locks and Golden Gardens. It is right on the Burke-Gilman trail which we enjoyed biking and running on. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall it was a nice stay, but it is only feels right to disclose the train noise to future guests. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n The pictures don\\'t really do this space justice —\\xa0it\\'s beautifully light and delightfully spare. Philip was responsive about getting the keys to us, even though he was out of town. And it\\'s really in quite a great place. That roof deck, man. Yes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a train, however, as mentioned in the listing. It is insanely close. It\\'s great for watching during the day, but at night, bring ear plugs or turn your white noise app up loud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis would be five cheerful stars if there had been ear plugs already there (the train is very, very close, which is great during the day, not so great at night) and if the kitchen had been slightly better stocked. We only cooked in during our time there and we ran into a few missing essentials, like a baking sheet. Would return! Thanks!  This house is truly beautiful. It is clean, brand new and very trendy. It is also about 10 minutes from the city, making it easy to go to-and-from. However, those are its only positives. \\n\\nWhen we booked our trip, there were no reviews for this house. So we felt a bit duped to find out the proximity of this house to the railroad. It\\'s basically in the front yard. At night, you\\'ll feel like the train is in your bedroom. The house was stocked with the bare minimum. One towel per person, one roll of toilet paper in each bathroom, one roll of paper towel.....catch my drift? After 4 days, we had to go and purchase all of these things so that we could finish out our stay. \\n\\nWe also had a hard time with the virtual keys that they have setup to get in/out of the house. Sometimes the app was responsive, other times it was glitchy and we were stuck outside. \\n\\nAll in all, we loved Seattle and had a great time. There are just a few things that need to be added to this house make it vacation or renter ready.  Philip answered promptly and gave accurate information, emailing instructions (the e-key software could not be accessed, so he kindly left metal keys instead) and even a list of nearby restaurants.The home was very clean and uncluttered, yet warm and inviting. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe booked this fabulous townhouse with another couple for a family event in Seattle. It was a perfect place to mingle, share meals, and invite a few folks, while still having private space (BRs w/baths on first and third floors, separate entrance at first floor). \\r\\n\\r\\nTall corner windows by the fireplace and TV (and in the master BR) overlooked the canal, harbor, passing ships, and sloping shores – a real piece of Seattle. But the truly panoramic view was from the rooftop patio (the “fourth level”) for morning coffee, evening cookouts, and sunsets over the distant mountains. Wow! The wet-bar/mini-fridge up there was a nice touch. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt first glance it was just a dead-end street, but it was a good walkable location near Old Ballard. We crossed the bridge and watched boats pass thru the Chittenden Locks, walked Magnolia and Discovery Park, and ate at a friendly local place (Kiss Café).   \\r\\n\\r\\nOne downside – the nearby railroad tracks. Before booking, I asked about this. Philip frankly replied that he didn\\'t mind the occasional passing trains but admitted the noise could be a problem at night. On arrival, there were bowls of what looked like mints next to each bed – tiny disposable earplugs! They did cut the sound and it wasn’t a real big issue for us, but it might be for some.      \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall a wonderful place to stay.\\r\\n The house is beautiful and Philip was responsive and helpful. Id definitely stay here again! Philip was great in providing info about entry to house and info about the neighborhood prior to our arrival.  The house was beautifully furnished and uncluttered.  We had been concerned about the on street parking, but were able to find a space in front of the house most days and only once needed to park up the block.  The roof deck is a great plus.  The trains were loud a few nights, but only a small discomfort considering all the positives.   This is a beautiful home in a beautiful location with a gorgeous view. I enjoyed waking up and going on my morning runs along the water. Beds wet comfy and Phillip was quick to respond to any questions we had prior to arrive.  I do have to say although the trains are awesome to see the do get very loud at night when sleeping. Some nights worse then others but that might have been the Vino.  The condo was immaculate and had everything we needed and more. There could have been a few more condiments (We ran out of salt and pepper). It was in walking distance of town, the Ballard locks and the beach was not too far away. The house is beautiful, comfortable, and better than expected. We would stay here again and again. So close to Ballard and all the restaurants, shops, and farmers market.   We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Philip\\'s place. The surrounding neighborhood offered ample amenities and opportunities for (email hidden)e house itself was immaculately clean, had a well-appointed kitchen, and, with living areas on four floors, lots of room. The roof deck was a particular plus, as it afforded us many stunning sunset views over Puget Sound. Regarding the train that runs past the house, we found that closed windows at night mitigated the the noise of squealing brakes; earplugs also helped.  Overall, however, the Market St. house is an architecturally interesting, spacious and pleasant place to stay. Our family loved the house, especially the rooftop deck! The views from the deck and full length windows of the water and surrounding water were beautiful. The Ballard neighborhood has lots of restaurants, places for great coffee, and interesting little shops. Philip was very helpful and provided us with lots of information about the local area. The passing trains were a bit disturbing the first night, but we quickly acclimated. We enjoyed our stay very  much.  Beautiful and very clean home in a great neighbourhood. Lots of restaurant and coffee shop options as well as cute little boutiques. The house was fully stocked and very comfortable. It was extremely easy to get downtown. The train is louder than I had expected but we got used to it right away and didn\\'t have to use the earplugs that the host provided. Our 3 month old slept right through it every time. Thanks so much! We would definitely stay again.  We had a wonderful time at Philip’s house in Ballard.  A great / private location just a few minutes’ drive from plenty of shops and restaurants.  The house was very clean and an interesting layout; offers privacy for couples or groups with the bedrooms on the first and third floors.  We enjoyed spending time on the roof.  Great views of the surrounding areas and the trains can be fun to watch – some seem to go on forever!  Be mindful they can be a bit noisy at night but as long as you are aware and prepared for this you will have a great time enjoying a true Ballard experience.  Thanks again for a wonderful stay. The listing was accurate and the house was beautiful. The roof deck amazing. The trains are close and loud but our group had no problems with it. This place is perfect for all (except those with noise sensitivy or difficulty with stairs). The owner was responsive with each inquiry. Overall perfect stay for a great price.  My wife and I had a wonderful stay! The place was everything we wanted - ultra-modern, plenty of space, close to the water and trails, but not too far from the city. As other reviewers have noted, you can definitely hear the trains at night, but they didn\\'t seem to bother us at all. Phil was very responsive, and we\\'d love to stay again!  Philip\\'s home is absolutely gorgeous; it was modern, clean, perfect scenery and made me love Seattle even more!  Philip was so accommodating and very helpful, which made the stay enjoyable.  Looking forward to booking this beautiful home again soon!!!! We had a great experience at this place! Philip was easy to reach and great to work with. The house was so neat and clean and had beautiful views of the water. It was an easy walk to the shops and restaurants in Ballard and a nice quiet neighborhood. The train nearby is pretty loud, but I\\'d still choose to stay here again! This was the simplest, easiest process ever. Philip was in touch with all the details we wanted/needed, but not over-the-top. We arrived to find a beautiful home with all the amenities we needed. Our stay was incredibly comfortable. I highly recommend Philip and this property!! Staying at Philip\\'s place was such a treat!  What a gorgeous home in such a wonderful setting.  The house is so comfortable,  stylish, and well equipped. The master bed was incredibly comfortable and the walk in shower was delightful.  The roof deck is a perfect place for a afternoon cookout, morning coffee, or evening drink.  Our son and daughter in law live just down the hill, so the location was perfect for us!  It was easy to find parking and the access to restaurants, coffee shops and walking trails were close.   Phillip was very kind and extremely accommodating. The home was perfect and very clean and in a great location. I would definitley stay here again will refer my friends.  The unit was great! Super cool and modern with great access to the entire city, although its hard to even want to leave the Ballard neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trains weren\\'t too bothersome and the hosts were kind enough to provide ear plugs. I\\'d say if you\\'re a light sleeper it could be an issue but otherwise the view and unit are worth it. Listing accurate, home lovely and clean. Quiet neighbors. No problem with the train noise - it was delightful to watch the trains from the roof.    Easy walk to Ballard shops and restaurants.  Beautiful views.  Would rent again.  Thank you for renting to us.   The listing was described accurately and the photos of the interior and views from the home showed what to expect when booking here. The master bedroom suite on the top floor was so nice with a great view of the bay and the trains going by. The trains were so fun to see and the sound was soothing. The walk in shower with river rock stones in the base was lovely!  We enjoyed the roof top deck with beautiful views. The home is tastefully decorated, comfortable and clean with nice bedding and comfortable beds in the master bedroom suite and the lower level guest room.  Parking was easy as was  getting in, even though we arrived late after dark. Fabulous host and fabulous town home. We were four:  the size and amenities were really comfortable. Trains were not as intrusive as I had read in some reviews. If you like trains, you will love this location. Would definitely stay there in the future. Great Ballard location. And, spotless! So happy to have found Philip\\'s listing; was the perfect location for us to spend our holidays.  A lovely home, very comfortable, and well equipped.  A stone\\'s throw from family and walking distance to great shops and restaurants. Philip was very responsive and a great host.  As others have mentioned, the house is very close to the trains, but we didn\\'t mind them at all - in fact, we enjoyed watching them.   Carol was a great host. She provided everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The bedroom and bed where right next to the bathroom, but the distracting noise was minimal. The location was great with buses going downtown and the U district. The house has a great view overlooking the neighborhood. Her dog, Watson, has very affectionate once you got to now him. I would definitely recommend staying at Carol\\'s house. Carol is a lovely host. Her home is incredibly charming, and it\\'s in a sweet neighborhood within walking distance to Golden Gardens. Recommended! Had a great stay at Carol\\'s place.  Lovely, charming, tidy house in a quaint neighborhood.  Fabulous hostess. Carol\\'s home was filled with incredible mid-century elements and inviting light. She was a lovely host-- so warm and friendly, and gave a ton of great advice for traveling in the area. I will definitely go back to stay with Carol when I\\'m in Seattle again. Also love the neighborhood surrounding her house and it\\'s proximity to the incredible Golden Gardens beach. Carol has been a wonderful host, taking her time to show me around the city a bit and her input made my stay a very special one, I feel I got a small hook on the city even if I was there for just a couple of days.\\r\\nThe house is really very nice and very originally decorated.\\r\\nThe location is in a quiet area a stroll from a park / beach, and a few good cafes around, plus Ballard and downtown Seattle are just a few minutes away by car.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall a great place to stay, highly recommended! I had a great time at Carol\\'s. She is warm and welcoming, and the place was comfortable, clean, quiet and had a great feeling about it.   Carol was an excellent, welcoming hostess. She was friendly and very knowledgeable about Ballard and Seattle, and her suggestions for activities really made my Seattle experience as fantastic as it could be. The room was comfortable and clean, her home is gorgeous, and I could not have asked for a better first airbnb experience. Many thanks =) Carol was a great host.  The house is very fun and the room is comfortable and as advertised.   Carol is a great, laid back host. I had a wonderful short stay with her in Seattle. Great Ballard restaurants and shopping are just a short drive or bike away from the house, and you can walk to the beach. Great location and value!! Thanks Carol! Carol was a very nice host! Accommodated me at the very last second! Definitely recommended to the airbnb community! It was my first experience of airbnb, and\\r\\nI have never imagined such a wonderful  time I could have. \\r\\nCarol is a tolerant, creative, and attractive person. \\r\\nHonestly I was a little bit tired of my staying in Seattle, \\r\\nbut it was totally healed by beautiful time with her.\\r\\nThank you so much, Carol.  Very simply Carol is great, and her house is awesome. The room worked perfectly for me.  Carol was just a wonderful hostess, such a fabulous home she has! This was my second stay at an Airbnb, and the experience just got better at Carol\\'s place.  Cute room, comfy bed and nice people, couldn\\'t ask for more.  Hope to stay there again next time I visit Ballard. Carol was great. Welcoming and accommodating. The room was cozy and comfortable, and the bathroom wonderfully luxurious. The neighborhood is quiet and pretty, and I was able to walk to the more happening part of lower Ballard in about 20-25 minutes. A lovely walk too! Oh and Watson the dog is small but mighty and cute. Highly recommended. My experience staying with Carol was wonderful! The room was comfortable spacious and I felt like I had my own space. Carol was warm and welcoming. I would surely stay here again! Staying at Carol\\'s place couldn\\'t have been lovelier. She greeted me at the door, showed me where everything was, and then left me to nap and prepare for a work function later that night in the nearby Ballard neighborhood. The room was exactly as shown in the photographs -- clean, comfortable, quiet and right next to a fabulous little bathroom, that looks to have been recently renovated. The twin bed was really, really comfortable and piled high with warm, fluffy blankets. I would stay at Carol\\'s house again in a heartbeat. Such a colorful, cool little place -- complete with a welcoming, laid-back, friendly host. Great repeat visit to this peaceful room. I have nothing bad to say. Would definitely book again! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with Carol and Watson the dog. :) Not only is her home artistic & inspiring but she is the hostess with the most-ess. She had cookies my last day and even though I was stuffed from dinner the house smelled lovely. I felt very welcome & relaxed. The room is quiet & comfortable. Never heard a peep from her awesome dog Watson. (He\\'s a total schloopy) I slept like a log after a long day of seeing friends & family all day in town.  The neighborhood is the best in Ballard. Highly recommended! I love the relaxed atmosphere and whimsical feel of Carols home. In particular I appreciate the ease with which I could come and go. Thank you Carol was a great host, welcoming and ready for my arrival. Enjoyed her place and the location is great.  Carol is a great host.  Her home is welcoming and very comfortable.  The neighborhood is beautiful and close to expansive water views. Carol was an incredibly host! The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was beautifully decorated. The space was perfect with a spring breeze and the bed was so comfortable I didn\\'t want to get up in the morning! A wonderful place to rest your head while in the Seattle area--with the most gracious of hosts. Thank you for a wonderful stay! I had a very peaceful time at carol\\'s home. Very nice location. I went to the beach everyday and got my workout fix from the stairs and a jog with a view of the water. I took a class at Swedish hospital in Ballard and it was a very fast drive to and from. There was always nearby parking at her place too. Carol was very nice and so was her son and pup! I had a pleasant stay at Carols house. It was close to everything and the beach was super close. I would stay there again.   I liked the location near Golden Gardens.  The room was very comfortable for a multiple night stay. A great location with close bus lines, a nearby beach  and easy to get into Seattle or nearby Ballard. I would stay here again. Carol was really flexible with my arrival time and the room is just like the picture. Carol was friendly, inviting and easy-going. She greeted me when I arrived and had a folder that included transportation routes and maps of personally recommended sights and restaurants in the area. Communicating with her before my arrival was easy and she responds quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe description of the room is spot-on and the pictures are accurate. There was even a personal coffee pot in the room and complimentary coffees. Carol\\'s house is also full of eclectic and whimsical details that combine beautifully into a charming and cozy home. Modern vintage feel indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood of Ballard is beautiful and less than a mile from the shores of the Puget Sound. I had a simply wonderful time walking around and suggest checking out the nearby Golden Gardens Park and Sunset Hill Park if you have the time, especially on a clear day. I would definitely stay here again if I am ever back in this area of Portland! Carol was very accommodating, as some of my travel plans got mixed up I had to find somewhere to stay relatively last minute. Everything was very clean and nice, good location! This was my first airbnb experience and it was fantastic. Carol was super accommodating with my checkin/checkout times because of the timing of my flights.  She also made suggestions for places to go and navigating the city, which was incredibly helpful. The house was warm and welcoming and I slept great.  I would totally stay here again when I come to town.  I was grateful when Carol agreed to host me for a few nights with just a few days in advance of my request. I love the Ballard area of Seattle, and her home looked welcoming. Indeed, it was, and she made me feel instantly at home. I reluctantly left my cozy bed early each morning for work, but it was among life\\'s singular pleasures to return each night to the home\\'s portal: a wooden door beneath an arched trellis, illuminated by twinkling faerie lights. Then it was back to that fabulous bedstead into which I snuggled for a night\\'s good rest. Not before reading a chapter or two by the lamp light perched in just the right place. Wonderful details that made my travel a source of refreshment. Many thanks to Carol, her son, and her pup.  Cute house - would be great for families with small children. Quiet neighborhood. Loved all the little notes with helpful tips. Vase of fresh flowers on the table, nice touch. Didn\\'t realize from the pictures how low the beds were, not easy for an arthritic 60 year old to get up in the morning, haha.  This was my first experience with airbnb and I couldn\\'t be more pleased. The home is beautiful, the neighborhood is lovely, and instructions from the host were made perfectly clear! Communication was excellent and the listing was accurately described.  Jeremy was an incredibly gracious host. He left detailed instructions tucked just where you might need them, rather than in a three page document and he checked on us beforehand to make sure we had gotten directions to his home. We were so grateful for him accepting a last minute request which provided us with a warm, family atmosphere to relax in with our sons from out of town. The location of Sunset Hill meant that our sons could walk to pick up delicious Italian food and the basement allowed them a place to hang out and play air shuffleboard and ping pong without us hearing once we had retired for the night in the beautiful master suite on the top floor of the house. It was a perfect weekend, capped off with glasses of wine on the front porch while we watched the sunset!  The house is huge and could probably sleep 12. We were looking for a house rather than a hotel so we didn\\'t feel compelled to go out all the time. Mission accomplished! This really felt like a home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe host really couldn\\'t have done much better. I didn\\'t feel scared to touch anything. And we were welcomed with a nice note and two bottles of wine. Just in general the notes were helpful for the stuff that is never easy, like the stove or the shower.\\r\\n\\r\\n Jeremy was an amazing host, and their house was absolutely beautiful. We had shopped around a bit before settling on this home and couldn\\'t be any happier with our decision. The experience here was incredible and we are truly thankful for Jeremy to provide it for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our next venture to Seattle, I would not hesitate to stay here again should it be available. Jeremy helped to render our short vacation a very, very memorable one, and would love to return in the future! They were gracious and considerate hosts who accommodated our needs and provided us with a great space to conduct our study. Would highly recommend their space! I needed a place to stay while my hardwood floors were being redone nearby.  It was a perfect home away from home as I\\'ve always admired the space from the outside.  They were great hosts: they even leave helpful notes around the house to get you settled in.  I\\'d definitely recommend staying here! We had a wonderful time staying in Jeremy and Rachael’s beautiful home in Seattle.  We felt completely at home during our entire stay.  The moment we arrived, we loved the unique architectural details in the home.  Jeremy and Rachael have a great design eye; the furnishings are tasteful and elegant, yet comfortable.  As six adults and a few children, we had more than enough space in the house and never felt cramped.  We enjoyed being able to cook our meals in the spacious, well-stocked, high-end kitchen.  Even on a cloudy day, the outstanding panoramic view of Puget Sound was fantastic.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location of the home is in a charming residential neighborhood tucked into a quiet corner of Seattle.  Almost everything we wanted to see was a quick 15- or 20-minute car ride away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe really couldn’t have asked for a more perfect place to stay in Seattle. Our five days at Jeremy and Rachael’s home at Sunset Hill in Seattle (Ballard) earn an A+.  It  was just about all it was advertised to be and turned out to be pretty much what we had hoped--but did not expect.   \\r\\nThe accommodations are quite adequate for six adults–-the air mattresses are more like beds than air mattresses.  We could have used another (third)  bathroom but we made do with the two available facilities.  The many steps, at first, were daunting; by the end of the visit we’d become used to them.\\r\\nOur hosts provided a fine array of dishes, utensils and cooking equipment,  but only French press coffee pots (which are inconvenient for making breakfast coffee for so many people).  We  borrowed an automatic drip pot.\\r\\nThe gas grill cooks Northwest salmon very well.  The kitchen stove is a bit scary.\\r\\nSome of us missed having a TV and a telephone land line; some of us did not.\\r\\nOur hosts are generous with provisions and with sharing much of what they have, including food in the fridge and the cupboards.  \\r\\nThe maintenance woman, whom we encountered incidentally, was kind and helpful.  Even though our hosts left us thorough,  written instructions  it helped to communicate with a live person.\\r\\nAll of our guests were pleasantly surprised at the accommodations; they thoroughly enjoyed being there.\\r\\nThe view of the sunsets is  awesome; the front and back yard landscaping are very well maintained.\\r\\nOver all, our stay at Sunset Hill was very pleasant.\\r\\nJeremy and Rachael’s home was our first experience with Airbnb.  We’re likely to use the service again.,\\r\\nThank you. We had a wonderful experience in this home. The house itself was spacious, gorgeous and amazingly well equipped. Jeremy and Rachael were easy to reach and very accommodating (even when they were halfway around the world on vacation!). I would highly recommend this house to anyone looking to stay in a home. Amazing views, quiet neighborhood and not far from a charming row of restaurants and bars on Ballard Ave. \\r\\n\\r\\nBonus: Sonos system house-wide :) Our stay on sunset Hill was perfect from start to finish.  Jeremy and Rachael were gracious and helpful every step of the way.  The home is beautiful, exceptionally well-equipped, and was ideally located for our stay.  I could not possibly come up with a negative comment.  We felt truly AT home.  The house was exactly as we expected - great location in a beautiful area.\\r\\nWe loved staying in Rachael and Jeremy\\'s home.  It was clean and we had everything we could have needed.\\r\\n We had a wonderful time at this beautiful home. Jeremy and Rachael have done so much beyond the usual to make guests\\' time easy, comfortable and relaxing. In addition to every aspect of the home being gorgeous, they have placed helpful signs in places that allow guests to easily find things. Their generosity with \"provisions\" extended to \"help yourselves to the fridge,\" which is so helpful when traveling. Make sure if you\\'re doing a two-stop vacation, make this home your second, because anything after it will feel like less. Jeremy and Rachel\\'s house is beautiful! We just rented it for a day for a shoot and we loved it! Its in a great location with an outstanding view and the hosts were very accommodating making sure we had everything to make it a successful day. We hope to see them again! The view was incredible - well worth the price!! The house was clean and although it was bit tight with 6 of us, everyone had a place to sleep :) \\r\\nJeremy and Rachael were very friendly and available when needed! We absolutely loved staying at Jeremy and Rachael\\'s home! It was perfectly equipped, charming, and welcoming. They were accommodating and helpful from beginning to end.  We couldn\\'t have asked for a better view and location and highly recommend their home.  Everything was perfect!  Jeremy was so welcoming; making sure every detail was to our liking--including rearranging beds for us!  There were flowers and a bottle of wine awaiting us upon arrival.  The house is lovely and as presented.  The kitchen is wonderful for cooks (which we are) and the downstairs family room was great for gathering.  I give Jeremy many thumbs up as a host. Our stay in this very comfortable home was absolutely wonderful - our hosts were very gracious and welcoming - with flowers and wine and when we couldn\\'t find a wine opener - Jeremy ordered 2 overnight via Amazon!  The open floor plan, with lots of natural light throughout the home combined with all the amenities made our stay perfect.  We enjoyed stunning sunsets from the living and dining room, not to mention the front deck.  The home was perfect for inviting some of our wedding guests over in the evenings on the deck and in the living/dining room.  Our son lived in Ballard and it is a great place to enjoy dining, shopping, the locks, and access to Golden Gardens.  Within 5 minutes is a great deli/cafe/bakery and organic grocery store with wine and a nice assortment of items.  10 minutes away is Cafe Besalu which has the best French pastries and croissants.  None of us wanted to leave this home and hopefully we can return soon and stay for 2 weeks the next time.   Rachael & Jeremy were very thoughtful to leave fresh flowers and their favorite bottle of wine awaiting our arrival.  It was very pleasant welcoming surprise.  The neighborhood is very nice with beautiful views but make sure your vehicles are locked.  Criminals like nice neighborhoods.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe home was exactly as described on the airbnb website.  \\r\\n\\r\\nRachael & Jeremy were kind enough to share their lovely home with our family for a wedding.  We were a family of 5 and had lots a room to maintain our own privacy, not disturbing others.  The gourmet kitchen had professional appliances that served our daughter, a pastry chef, perfectly for completing a wedding cake she brought with her from many miles away and baked the grooms\\' cake, decorating and completing it there.  Having 2 refrigerators worked well for the various stages of the 2 cakes and holding flowers also for the cake.  The beautiful views of Puget Sound made it difficult to accomplish tasks cause we just couldn\\'t break away.  The home was immaculate and nicely appointed in every area.  The Sonos sound system throughout the home, for the classic music we enjoyed, along with the original wood In the 1927 Craftsman home, brought us back to a different era.  Using airbnb for the first time was perfect for our needs and Rachael & Jeremy were the most gracious hosts.  The many notes throughout was quite helpful by explaining how different systems work.   The airbnb experience and this home was far above our expectations.  It was very relaxing and comfortable.  The home was organized and efficient.   Jeremy and Rachael are very organized.  Everything is explained well and the house is comfortable and clean and uncluttered.  It is a very beautiful home in a great area of Seattle.  We had a wonderful stay at Jeremy and Rachael\\'s beautiful home.  They were very welcoming in their messages to us and left a very nice bottle of red wine waiting for us at arrival.  The location was excellent for us, and the home is very comfortable and had plenty of room for myself, wife, daughter and son-in-law.  It has a wonderful front deck with bay view.  It is very well maintained and furnished very nicely with nice finishes.  The kitchen and dining area is very nice and well equipped, and we loved the commercial range for cooking our Thanksgiving dinner for the four of us plus my son and his wife.  The master bedroom and large downstairs room had wonderful beds, linens, and towels.  The master and main floor bathrooms are very nice.  The house manual has very complete information and it is well organized.  In a word everything worked out perfectly, and we left very happy and satisfied.  This was our first experience using Airbnb and needless to say it was a very good one.  The house is gorgeous, with all the comforts of home. It\\'s every bit as beautiful as it looks in the photos. John and Audrey were wonderful hosts and showed us around before they left on their vacation and we immediately felt at home when we moved in. The neighborhood is great with easy walking into Ballard, but out of things enough that it\\'s quiet and has easy parking. .  This is a beautiful house in a nice neighborhood.  We stayed here to attend the Bumpershoot and see some of the Seattle area.  You\\'ll probably have to use some form of transportation to get around, and there\\'s a public bus stop nearby if you don\\'t want to deal with personal driving in the city.  Light sleepers should beware that the house is next to a railroad track and has runs periodically through the night..  The layout of the house is outstanding and the kitchen was simply delightful.  The master bedroom and shower/whirlpool will spoil one. All in all, it was a delight to stay here.  The host was very quick to answer any questions we had. This is a great house. All new and beautifully done. It\\'s the kind of place you want to hang out in. But the location is also great, because you\\'re right near the water, and right near Ballard. John knows just what to recommend in Ballard. If you stay at this lovely house, you seriously need to go to The Walrus & Carpenter--killer oysters and great sea food. Sit up at the raw bar and talk to the oyster shuckers while you eat. We also had dinner at Bastille, a French Restaurant--one of the few places in North America that serves Boudin Noir, if you are so inclined. They too did a solid job.\\r\\nJohn, made everything very simple, and stayed in easy communication. The house was beautiful and spacious, decorated with plenty of Christmas cheer.  The neighborhood is wonderful and close to many restaurants, cafes, and bus stops.  Our family enjoyed the trip and look forward to returning. John has a great place in the charming and cool Ballard neighborhood. The house is walking distance to great bars,  restaurants and eclectic shops. Staying at John\\'s place afforded us the relaxing setting of a quiet neighborhood but the close proximity to downtown Seattle. Would definitely recommend staying here.  This is a beautiful home in the great neighborhood of Ballard.  We came into Seattle on the train and were able to easily access the neighborhood and also head downtown via public transportation.  Having a spacious residence to use as \"home base\" throughout the weekend made for a relaxing trip. An absolutely beautiful home in a great location. It\\'s light filled and spacious with a gorgeous kitchen and a layout that encourages lounging. We are former Seattle-ites who were in town for a weekend. It was great to be located near some of our favorite places, a few minutes from downtown Ballard as well as Golden Gardens and the Ballard Locks. The Sunday farmers market in the neighborhood is delightful. Great food in the area includes THE best pastries in the city at Cafe Besalu, also: La Carta de Oaxaca, The Walrus and the Carpenter, Bastille, Volterra, señor moose.  Delicious quick options include Red Mill Burgers and Pho Than Brothers. Although the food isn\\'t great, you also can\\'t beat the deck at Rays Boathouse at sunset.  If you want to see neighborhoody Seattle you could do no better, you can occupy yourself for several days and never go more than a few miles.\\nThanks for letting us stay in your delightful home!  The reservation was canceled 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. John and his were wife we\\'re perfect host.  Their home was lovely, spacious and clean.  I fell in love with neighborhood. Lots of beautiful flowers and flowering trees, close to some of the restaurants, movie theatre, cools shops and great views.  Highly recommended! PROS: Very nice home, well accommodated, with responsive and pleasant hosts! We needed three bedrooms and a hotel would have been expensive and separated our family so having a great place that we could all stay together at an affordable price in a hip neighborhood really made our weekend :)\\r\\n\\r\\nCONS: I love trains so it was ok for me, however, they do run periodically near the neighborhood during the day/night so for those sensitive to noise this may be something to think about. Beautiful Home. Had a lot of fun staying there. Everything we needed was available to us. Some of the other reviews mentioned the train being quiet, and this did not seem to be the case. With the house having no AC, we slept with the windows open the first night. The trains go by throughout the night and were quite loud, even with the windows closed. Really glad we chose the house, but wish the train noise wasn\\'t so loud. Thanks! Really nice house! Very beautiful! We loved staying at John and Audrey\\'s beautiful home. The listing is accurate, the place as pictured, and the pricing makes sense. It is in an excellent location (easy walk to Ballard, a bit longer but totally doable walk to Golden Gardens) with a nice view of the water from the master balcony and very clean and comfortable (great bed!). And it has good energy! Which is great. My husband and I really enjoyed being so close to Ballard\\'s bustling (and fantastic) restaurants, etc., and appreciated John\\'s restaurant recommendations. Check in/check out instructions were easy and totally reasonable. We only stayed two nights but would absolutely come back! John made the process very easy and his home was absolutely gorgeous.  Would definitely recommend to others! John and Audrey\\'s home is the perfect place to stay. The house is warm and inviting, and we just loved everything about it. The decor was my personal favorite, from the oh so cool baby blue painted piano to the long rustic yet modern wooden benches along the table that easily sat our party of 8 for meals. The surrounding neighborhood of Ballard is so cute and is full of cool little shops and restaurants. Highly recommend their beautiful home!!  The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. We had the most enjoyable time this past weekend at this BEAUTIFUL home. Our host, John, with whom I communicated, was beyond helpful and prompt to answer any questions I had. His home included all we needed. We were busy with activities for our son\\'s wedding during our days spent there, but there are many things to do and places to eat in the immediate area. I think I would love to come back next time to enjoy some of the surrounding neighborhood. If you are looking for a home to rent, THIS is THE one for you! You can tell by the photos of their family throughout the house, there\\'s a lot of love and happiness within the walls of this home. It\\'s a gorgeous house, yet very warm and welcoming, a true reflection of the hosts!!!!  Lovely home in a great area.  One of the best areas in all of Seattle is just a short walk away, which we took advantage of on our first night. \\nEverything was easy to navigate (wireless internet+Bluetooth sound system), left us great recommendations  on where to eat. The second bedroom above the garage was huge and felt like its own master suite. Truly enjoyed our stay. A+ We really enjoyed our stay in Ballard- it\\'s a great neighbourhood to visit and is convenient for central Seattle.  The house is perfect for families (we are a family of 5) and John was a great host. Some mention of the train in other comments ( it does run pat the house and does make some noise). This was not an issue for us.  If you are staying in Seattle we would definitely recommend. Had a great stay at John\\'s place! Close to everything in Ballard and the house was even better than the pictures showed. Would recommend to anyone visiting Seattle looking for a comfortable place to stay! Our stay last weekend was a bad experience. We arrived Friday night to a dark house without the heat turned on. It didn\\'t take more than a few minutes to feel as though we were breaking and entering, that is, not welcome whatsoever. The kitchen was not particularly clean and the laundry room, where we were instructed to hang our clothes, was a complete wreck. In the master bathroom, only one piece of tiny, well-used soap was left for us, along with bleached-stained towels. The nightstands in the master bedroom had stacks of books on top of them. The master bed was very nice, and it was the only redeeming quality that we found here. Overall, we found the pictures posted on the Airbnb site to be very misleading. It astounds me that we paid well over $700 to stay here. Don\\'t make the same mistake. \\r\\n\\r\\n We had a blast at Michelle and Mark\\'s home! The place is in one of the hottest neighborhoods in Seattle - Ballard. It is a short walk from all the action, but just far away enough where the street noise of bars can\\'t be heard. The home is indeed luxurious with tastefully decorated furnishings throughout, and guests have everything they need to make themselves comfortable. The home also has an amazing rooftop deck with views of the water that cannot be beat. Although we love exploring all that Seattle has to offer, we found ourselves very much happy to spend time at the property and soak in its comforts and views throughout. The couple was also very communicative and easy to coordinate with. As an Airbnb traveler and host, I would not hesitate to come stay at their home again. Thanks Michelle and Mark for opening your home to us! A beautiful home to stay in. Love the roof on a warm night. Host is wonderful to work with. Responded quickly to all my questions.  I stayed here with my wife and parents over a long weekend trip to the Seattle area. The house was beautiful, as advertised and worked perfectly for the four of us. The house is walking distance to downtown Ballard and the Locks and it only takes 15ish minutes to get into downtown Seattle by car. The location was nice for us in that it was a quiet, peaceful setting on the water in Ballard but still conveniently central in greater Seattle. The rooftop deck overlooking Salmon Bay was everyone\\'s favorite feature for enjoying a morning coffee or meal with drinks. Great place!'"
